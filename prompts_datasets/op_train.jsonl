The maximum quality of the recording you hear is a union of the manufacturing process of the record, and your listening equipment.\n2. You don't listen to vinyl in a vacuum, therefore there's a huge amount of variance based on the players themselves which negates any quality argument.\n3. The \"warmth\" of a record can be trivially replicated with filters and effects - it's a side effect, not an attribute of the format.\n4. Any arguments that you can detect the \"analogue-ness\" of the sound is irrelevant to human ears with our generally poor frequency response range.\n5. The only thing \"lost\" is a big picture, but we've long replaced artwork with music videos and other forms of interacting with music and artists.\n\nAs a result, I feel that the only reasons people now purchase vinyl is to participate in some kind of exclusive elitest club, in a world where music has infinite availability.

I can't see why as they do no harm and are probably unnecessary at worst.\n\nWe already tag our posts with NSFW/NSFL as a courtesy to other users. As far as I understand, a trigger warning is just a more specific version of an NSFW/NSFL tag. I don't see the problem with this. There are certain things that I have no desire to see and I'd appreciate being warned before accidentally clicking on them. I can sympathise with the point of view that someone who has suffered some sort of trauma would like to be warned before being potentially reminded of it.\n\nLet's take a slightly ridiculous example. Suppose that I want to post a picture of my breakfast, but for some reason believe that some people may suffer panic attacks upon the sight of Weetabix. I therefore include the phrase \"Trigger Warning: Contains Weetabix\" in my example. I think we can all agree that doing so is unnecessary, but I haven't done anybody any harm and there's no cause for complaint. \n\nNB. Let's save discussion about whether we SHOULD use trigger warnings for another time. My view is just that they do no harm and we shouldn't really complain about them.\n\n\n\nDelta: /u/s4par pointed out that overuse or frivolous use of trigger warnings can be harmful if the poster does not specify what the trigger warning is for.\n\nHonourable mention: /u/nwf839 convinced me that, unless you have some expertise on PTSD, it is better to use a general term like \"graphical content warning\" rather than \"trigger warning.\" However, I don't think this is inconsistent with my view that the trigger warnings aren't harmful."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I believe that the Harry Potter films are examples of a bad adaptation, and that Harry Potter would have been better served adapted into a TV series. + \n + Long, big book series don't lend themselves well to movie adaptations, because they always have to sacrifice parts of the actual story to make room for budget and time constraints. That's understandable. It's a big part of the reason that adaptations are leading to splits in books (while I wouldn't be able to justify the Hobbit being three movies, I can justify splitting Mockingjay and Deathly Hallows, as they are long books that would be impossible to adequately adapt into a single movie).\n\nAs for the Harry Potter movie series as a whole, I find many faults. Some come from the larger books towards the end, in which it's understandable that everything can't fit. But even from the start, the adaptations were lacking.\n\n[This image](https://i.imgur.com/3KkXXme.png) and it's [corresponding thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/2qqbth/book_hermione_vs_movie_hermione/) on /r/harrypotter adqueately express my distates at the way Ron and Hermione's characters were adapted in the movies. Ron is less loyal, Hermione is less human, and the trio is less strong because of it.\n\nGinny, Dobby, and several other characters also received bad treatment. They were cut out of some of the middle movies because of time constraints, and so developments like Dobby's death or Ginny's relationship with Harry lack the same amount of gravity.\n\nIn the later books, things got worse. Entire plotlines and characterizations were lost. Some of the magic that made the world so deep was cut. We never learn that James, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew were the Marauders and made the map. We don't even learn that Pettigrew was called Wormtail by his friends. The first time we hear the name is from Voldemort.\n\nInstead of a variety of different spells, there were like 3 that were ever used in fights. The duels were abysmal.\n\nThe last movie especially was butchery. By splitting the book up, it gave them the opportunity to do the Battle of Hogwarts justice. Instead they butchered almost everything, especially in the final moments when Harry defeats Voldemort.\n\nWith that exception, most of those issues were due to time constraints. That's why, a Game of Thrones-style adaptation of 10 1-hour episodes per season would have been a better treatment.\n\nThe only argument I see against it is that the early books don't have enough substance. So my two solutions are to spend the extra time building the world and exploring some of the side-characters (other students, for example), or to merge SS/CoS into one season.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Granted, older consoles used chips often found in PC's (the NES's CPU was based off the design of the one used in the Apple II and C64, Genesis used the Zilog Z80 And Motorola 68K, ect.) but they produced results that greatly differed from one another in terms of processing, sound and graphics. But with this current gen, both the Xbox One and PS4 use the same micro-architecture (x86) in their APU's that are manufactured by the same company, AMD, that is used in current PC's today. Many of both consoles' non-exclusives have also been shown to underperform graphically when pitted against desktops made for the same price as them.\n\n\nThe other point that I feel no longer separates consoles and PC's is their firmware and the need to constantly update it as well as patch games via internet. Again, with older consoles, if I put a functioning copy of Super Metroid in any working SNES, it should play immediately, and that's it. I can understand with the 6th Generation's addition with a UI to adjust the clock, manage saves and other basic functions, but when there were additions like internet browsers, multimedia players, Streaming Video, and other services that added nothing to one's gameplay experiences, it seemed like a waste of resources, and redundant when my computer can do the same things.\n\nAnd on the subject of online patches, I'd like to give another example concerning cartridge-based games. Sure, there were rereleases of patched games, like Final Fantasy 6 fixing a bug with a character's common skill or one of the Shinobi games taking out the blatant copyright infringing characters or Ocarina of Time's removal of bugs and Islamic references. But most times, the game you bought was the game you got. Now, we have to add storage devices to hold all the revisions of Skyrim, Borderlands, and Halo; a similar issue PC users have to deal with.\n\n\nAnother small point is that of maintenance. Ignoring that older consoles last longer due to simpler internals and arguably more durable designs, 360's are imfamous for their Red Ring of Death errors. And if it wasn't covered under warranty, and you don't have the specific parts to fix it, you may be SOL. And yes, it is possible to for PC's to be totaled for numerous reasons. However, you can more easily test components to see which could be salvaged, and which need replaced, and you have plenty of different makes and models to choose from.\n\n\nI realize that in this argument, I may failed to avoid the \"PC Master Race\" circlejerk enticement. But that is why I'm here, to hear the other side's arguments and understand the possible flaws in my thinking."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I also don't see why when we do get to school at 7:42 am, we just sit in advisory for ~half an hour doing nothing when we could have spent that time sleeping more. I don't care if advisory is to make sure 1st period starts with students already in school. If people are later to school than 8:28, that's on them to catch up on whatever they missed. We shouldn't be forced to wake up so early and then have to sit through advisory. Middle schoolers start school at around 8:28 am which is about the time we high schoolers get out of advisory and into 1st period. Why do High Schools have to be different?

As it stands currently where I live, a woman can have an abortion, but she has to go in and talk to someone alone to be sure the man isn't forcing her. But, what if the case is the opposite? What if the pregnancy is an accident, and the woman doesn't want to keep it, but the man does. It seems unfair to me that when a child is born, if the woman wants it and the man doesn't, hes forced to pay child support, but if the position is reversed the woman can just go have an abortion. Essentially, that's saying that the man has no rights to the life of a fetus, even though it's his the same way it will be if its born. Before it's born, he has no rights over it and can't accept it as his, and after it's born he's forced to. I think in the case of an accidental pregnancy, if the woman does not wish to have a child and the man does wish it enough to lose the woman over it, she should have to carry the baby to term and the man should get sole custody afterwards. If the position were reversed, the man could take off, and the woman could have the baby herself. (For the sake of this argument I'm ignoring cases in which carrying the baby is harmful to the mother, that would of course still be abortion-able (terrible word...)). I understand that that would force the woman to spend nine months carrying a baby she would not want to, but that would be a consequence to her actions (everyone knows sex is never 100% safe, so its a risk we take every time. Sometimes you draw the short stick). Paperwork would have to be signed beforehand to ensure that once the baby is born the woman has no responsibility towards it. \n\nTLDR: Why do women get the entire say on an abortion? The man is held responsible once the child is born, yet has no rights on the fetus before its born? \n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Anything that left a permanent or even semi-lasting mark would be to much, but a fleeting stinging on the cheek I see no problem with.\n\nI don't think it should be sudden or for something little. it has to be something serious and come prior warning and explanation.\n\nI think pain can communicate the seriousness of doing something very wrong, to a child who doesn't understand that something is wrong yet and i think some children just don't respond to be being told off or having things taken away from them. Some will respond that way to being hit as well, but i think some would understand it more easily since its so tangible and is obviously a deterrent.\n\n\nI don't think its right for every child and situation. I don't think every parent should do it and i don't think it will always work, but i do think that in moderation it is sometimes an acceptable form of discipline. \n\nIve had discussions with people about it and most say they just don't feel right doing it. I can see that and it is unpleasant, but any other kind of discipline will make the child feel bad as well, just in a different way. It still hurts them and i don't think the physical hurt of smack is so much more barbaric than say sending them to be alone in their room, if that's the thing they hate most.\n\n\n\n\n* If the kid stole a cookie, i would ask why and if the answer was good i would obviously let it slide.\n\n* If the answer was bad, eg\"because mums cooking sucks\" i would sternly tell them to put it back and explain to them why they cant have it and why what they did was wrong.\n\n* If they refused i would take it out of their hands and tell them to go to their room or something like that.\n\n* If they refused to go to their room i would warn them that if they don't go they'll get a smack.\n\n* I would also talk to them about it afterward once everything had calmed down."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It does not violate anyone's privacy since they are posting that information online for all to see anyway. \n\nThere's no reason to cast a blanket over all of social media and say that none of it can be used in court just because there may or may not be some tampering of evidence. When you think about it, all evidence can be tampered with. Since the days of Rome, evidence has been messed with so that one person can claim it as proof of another person's wrongdoing. \n\nIn today's world, where we live in and with social media, are our facebook and twitter accounts simply just extensions of ourselves? If someone posts that they want to kill someone, and they are later convicted of killing someone, should their post not be used as some form of evidence? If someone cheats and takes a photo, is that not reason for divorce? Why should there be a blanket over all of social media that prevents any of it from being used in court?

People can't seem to figure out where the line of consent is drawn, so I support absolute, explicit consent before either party can continue. \n\nThe way I see it, the only downside is that it decreases the chance of sex if there is some sort of miscommunication. If the only downside to explicit verbal consent is less sex, that's not so bad. No one *needs* sex. However, the downside to misreading signals and pressing on when the other party does not wish to is rape, which is awful. Between these two choices I can't help but prefer the first.\n\nThe only other downside I have heard is that \"it kills the mood\". But last night I asked my girlfriend explicitly for consent and she gave it verbally, even though we typically just assume the other is down for the dirty. And it didn't kill the mood at all! I believe this tactic would also be great for preventing false rape accusations. No more blurred lines, no more false claims. \n\nFinally, there has to be a clause where the consent must also be given while the consenter is in his/her right mind. They can't consent while too drunk or otherwise impaired (I don't know how to explicitly define this, though, since everyone's tolerance is different), or while they are sleeping, or when they are underage, etc. "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Towards the end of many games, the team who is winning (or drawing if they are underdogs) will often try and slow the the games down in order to increase their chances of getting a good result. I have no problem with players doing this with match tactics, however you will see is players taking an extremely long time over set plays (throw-ins, free kicks, corners, goal kicks etc.) and also faking injury to run the clock down. Whilst extra-time is added on for injuries it is not usually added for set plays. This is incredibly frustrating for supporters to watch and can make a match very boring, especially if a team starts doing this from early in the match. I believe that stopping the clock every time the ball goes out of play would stop this behaviour and make for more exciting and fairer matches. The half/match could end at the point after the timer ends when the ball leaves the pitch.\n\nCMV!"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I am saying that such a system will help weed out parents that cannot support a child (ex druggies, people that cannot afford to have one) and therefore will reduce the burden that kids (and future adults) that have not been raised well. A poor couple who is able to reject the money will show that they they place a significant value on their child  and will be just as likely to care for their kid as a wealthier couple. But when you compare those who can afford a child to those that cant, obviously the those that have more money will be able to better support one. Not only does this prevent the financial effects that a child places on a couple but will help end the cycle of poverty that continuously effect generations.\n\nThe burden of a one time lump sum to those that accept the offer will be much less than paying for the social support systems to take care children in poverty and the families that will be kept in poverty due to having a child. In addition, I believe he amount of various crimes will be reduced in this country (I dont have a source for this).\n\nI believe that every person has the right to have kids and therefore such a program will be VOLUNTARY.

Anyway, those features are part of the reason why I find feminine women sexually attractive.\nNow to where the real seperation is: The difference between sexual and romantic attraction. If I'm bisexual, I find women attractive for their feminine qualities and men for their masculine qualities. There's nothing wrong with someone breaking the gender binary but more or less they're going to be male or female and that's where you're going to derive attraction from. However, when you're pansexual you're likely to derive attraction from a) Gender neutral features (Oh, they've got lovely hair or something along those lines) or emotional features (Wow, he's got an awesome personality!) exclusively. I'm not going to deny that those are attractive features to someone that's LGB, but when you see the pansexual person that's typically a determining factor.\n\n*\u2206 Alright, I'll give it to you for the physical vs. mental attraction divide. I suppose I'd be more of a physical attraction kind of person, seeing someone I find attractive physically before going up to meet them and find out if I'm attracted to them mentally as well. I still think it's a little bit of a vague arbitrary line to draw, but looking at myself and how a lot of what I find \"attractive\" in a guy are perhaps some of the more feminine features, I have to admit that bisexuality fits me more for that reason.*\n\n\n\n*\u2206 Hadn't even considered the fact that someone might be attracted physically to the person before transitioning and not after, and that bisexual physicality could cause issues while pansexual non-physicality wouldn't.*\n___\nAs a bisexual myself, I've never really understood the need for the term \"Pansexualism\". The difference in definition, as far as I can tell, is that Bisexual just means someone who could be attracted to either sex, and Pansexual is someone who could be attracted to either sex or gender identity. To me, this is more confusing for people who are trying to understand the LGBT movement because most people know what Bi means but don't know what Pan means, but also outcasts Transgender people more. For myself, if I'm fine with either sex, why would I not also be fine with either gender identity? I'm attracted to the person and what I find cute/attractive, and if I get along with them as a person arbitrary things like that don't matter. However, saying \"I'm Pansexual\" to me sounds more like \"I'm okay with boys, girls, and transgenders\" which makes them sound like some kind of awkward third category that has to be added on. \n\nSo, CMV: What added benefit does the term \"Pansexual\" have over \"Bisexual\" which is not negated by the confusion and potential labelling of trans people? \n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

From a young age boys are encouraged to try sports in a way women aren't. This is definitely a problem that needs to be addressed, but by society, not the law. Since there are more men in sports the proportionality is way off, but title 9 treats it as equal. It's comparable to a hypothetical scenario where an engineering program had to contain the same number of female students as male. There's just a larger supply of guys. \n\n2: It isn't so much that women are being empowered, but more that men are being depowered. The university I attended was forced to cut 4 men's programs as a result, no women's programs were added. \n\n3: People watch men's sports. American culture is based around male athletes who are revered and idolized. Obviously this happens for female athletes too, but nowhere near the same level. Just try to name 3 WNBA players. Speaking of which, the WNBA actually runs a $300,000 dollar deficit every year.

It seems so self-defeating to be stubborn about it if there's nothing to worry about. Maybe a small percentage of consumers will boycott them for a short time until they realize nothing is happening to anyone else. But other than that, there is no other problem that I can see with it, assuming that said food is indeed safe(which I've came to the conclusion it is.) We have surgeon generals warnings on tobacco and alcohol, and while I know those are different from food, it's not like the surgeon general's warning stopped many people from purchasing either one of these items.\n\nFrom everything I've seen, Monsanto isn't the monster they were made out to be, but I at least can understand people having an issue with a potential future monopoly on the food industry, and wanting to keep an eye on it.\n\nBut Monsanto isn't really my issue either. I think my issue stems from a conversation recently where someone who was anti-labeling had an argument consisting of these 2 defense points:\n\n    \"It perpetuates a culture of HATE and FEAR.\"\n\n    \"It's like making every gay person wear a sign that says \"FAGGOT\"\n\nBoth of these remarks are absolutely idiotic, and I couldn't even find a rational argument without wanting to tear my hair out.\n\nIf anyone has any better reasonings, and I KNOW you guys in this sub do, then please, CMV.

Biodiversity keeps the ecosystem intact, and at minimum we depend on the resources in our ecosystem for our survival. This ecosystem also serves us beyond our survival needs. In regards to higher order needs. It is clear we perceive a certain inherent beauty of natural phenomena - we tour the wilderness, we watch documentaries, and we share stories of our encounters with nature, and we derive happiness from it.\n\nEven from a purely pragmatic standpoint, it can be argued that the value of a healthy ecosystem is obvious. It is a resource shared by all, and to endanger its balance is to harm every member of our species by recklessly damaging a critical shared resource. At minimum, it is obvious that this ecosystem must be capitalized on in a sustainable manner. Poachers clearly act against this interest, even going as far as to kill game wardens who get in their way.\n\nWhen current measures to save critically endangered species is on a brink of failure, it should be allowed for an international militia formed by volunteer fighters to take up arms against poachers who seek to personally gain by unjustly taking away from this shared resource. This militia should be allowed to guard critically endangered species, and furthermore be allowed to kill poachers on sight. This would provide a serious disincentive against poaching, as now a poacher's chance of dying in their line of work would be significantly escalated.\n\nShould it be the case that the law does not recognize this militia as being legitimate, the activities of a volunteer-only militia that protects critically endangered species with lethal force would not be morally unacceptable, as they are putting their lives on the line to defend a vital shared resource against the parties who have demonstrated the willingness to exploit it at the expense of everyone else, and who have, at times, killed other human beings to pursue this end.\n\nCMV!"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

But some of the programs that many universities, my own included, are implementing are going to what seems like extremes to prevent rape or sexual assault.  I'll be citing examples from my own experience with just such a program, but unless I'm mistaken (a real possibility) the program I experienced is representative of a larger trend.\n\nAs part of my freshman summer assignment, I had to go through an online module that took about three hours to complete (even at a brisk pace), which I find rather excessive.  It essentially told me that I shouldn't attack (verbally, physically, or otherwise) or harass people or make sexual advances without enthusiastic consent, and told me what to do if I see someone potentially harming or taking advantage of someone else; I agree with the message (mostly) but the fact that I can summarize so completely and concisely a three hour long module is kind of ridiculous.  It also cited a statistic that \"1 in 5 women are sexually assaulted\" which has been shown to be suspect, at best [self-selected sample from 2 universities, hardly statistically rigorous].  If I were a girl who didn't know better, I would seriously be afraid for my life.  I don't mean to downplay the significance of rape or sexual assault, but I find this kind of response to be alarmist and believe it will only cause more violent reactions.  Creating this amount fear tends to create panic, and panic tends to lead to chaos.\n\nThe module gave off the impression that any sort of hesitation should be grounds for immediate cessation of sexual activity; it says that anything short of enthusiastic consent should be taken as a \"no.\"  Are new lovers supposed to never supposed to go beyond that initial insecurity or hesitance?  I find this to be alarmist, and I worry that such a fearful treatment of sex only adds to the taboo that the USA already places around anything sexual.\n\nAlso, one section of the module spoke about rape involving alcohol.  It stated that alcohol removes a person's ability to consent, and thus negates their responsibility to avoid unwanted sex (which I can see, within reason; 1 glass of wine does not a drunkard make [usually]) but that it also does not excuse a person's behavior, and does not render someone innocent of rape.  This seems contradictory.  The module made it seem like a woman is free to drink however much she likes without taking any responsibility (though it did make a note that this was risky behavior), while a man should always be careful because being drunk does not excuse his actions.  I understand that a drunk man forcing sex on a woman is rape, and that a man taking advantage of a drunk woman is rape, but what happens when both are drunk?  By the time I got to this portion, I'd been hammered with all manner of \"don't be a rapist\" and I seriously wonder if both parties being intoxicated would make consensual sex \"okay\" in the eyes of my college.\n\nI'll mention the distinct lack of male victims/female perpetrators - it honestly seemed like the message to men was \"don't rape\" and the message to women was \"watch out for rape\"; even the several fictional examples were of men assaulting women - but I recognize that that's moving into \"oppression olympics\" territory.\n\nThe thing that disturbs me the most is the sinking idea that the kind of people who need this message the most aren't going to listen; those who take this kind of message seriously are already going to avoid assaulting people and be generally kind to one another, while the kind of people who will rape or do other nasty things aren't going to pay much attention.  It obviously isn't going to help the ones who already know their actions are wrong, and I feel like the ones who rationalize their actions, or genuinely believe their actions to be okay, will simply ignore the message as just another \"play nice with others\" ad from school, or worse, an overreaction not meant for them.  I realize how hypocritical that makes me sound, but trust me when I say all of my peers (females included) are also mocking the program for being excessive.  If the program is so lengthy and overdone that many people treat it as a joke, it only gives more credence to those who would dismiss it no matter how long or intense it was.\n\nAs I understand it, my college is far from being an outlier.  If other colleges are doing the same, then they are collectively creating an environment of fear and victimhood for young women, not to mention the demonization of men.  I understand the necessity for knowledge about how to prevent these horrible crimes, but when the rallying cry is \"Not Anymore\" as if these crimes were common or even accepted anywhere in the recent past, I have to question the knowledge and intention of the creators.  It's starting to feel like we've moved beyond crime-prevention and are moving towards McCarthy-esque paranoia.\n\nPlease change my view, it's no fun feeling this way."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It has been clarified that the subreddit is not for literal 5 year olds, but is simply so that answers are appropriate. Heres the problem, the answers are often more complex and have simply become /r/askscience type answers. The original intent was that questions would be answered with allegory or simple models so that anybody could understand, but in reality the questions are just answered by specialists (or not as I will discuss next) with no nod towards the subreddits intent. \n\n2) Plausibility counts for more than reliability. Top answers rarely contain references, and there are often 2 contrasting answers (providing different explanations) both of which sound right so were upvoted. This is exacerbated as many questions have opinion based answers or are otherwise loaded/political, or there are several convincing explanations and nobody can be bothered to actually find out, so simply theory craft. [This is a problem that mods are aware of](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1xjlfo/eli5_why_do_black_women_have_larger_and_more/cfc3vp8) but I believe it is a battle they are losing.

Some of them tip the scale, weighing 300+ lbs., appearing more as blobs than normal people. These people, out of consideration for those around them, should buy a second ticket for themselves and eat the cost.\n\nI bring this up out of recent experience; I went to see a ball game today, and to my horror, when we found our seats, they were right next to a hugely overweight woman. I tried to squeeze myself into my seat, but the fat lady's rolls of blubber were pushing deep into the territory of my seat: over and under the arm rest. Disgusting. After a couple of minutes of trying to make do, her slightly less fat S.O. arrives, and now of course more rolls of fat come whaling over into my seat. Of course he brought snacks for them to feed on. I tell her to keep herself to her side of the arm rest, and when she is unable to reconfigure her flab, I get up, exclaiming I can't do this. My dad is willing to trade seats and cope with the problem, so I relent. I was about to have looked for a stadium attendant to complain. Ultimately, we leave the game early as of course the fat situation had become too much weight for my father to bear as well.\n\nTo my mind, she and her S.O. should have bought extra seats as they're already kind of tight for normal-sized adults. This applies in many other situations where people buy seating: concerts and the symphony, airplanes, bus rides, anywhere where the not buying an extra ticket would weigh down neighbors' comfort or experience compared to a normal-sized adult. If a man puts his hand on a neighboring woman's thigh on the plane or at a sports event, it is harassment; it should not be any different if a fat person puts their rolls of fat against someone.\n\nFat people have other options, too, besides buying another ticket:\n\n* Exercising and eating healthier\n* Staying home and watching the game on TV\n\nIf they choose to go for the immediate gratification of buying the one ticket and gambling on whether someone will be seated next to them (and be willing to complain), they should expect sanctions of being compelled to buy another ticket or leaving without refund.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

For a smart kid, however, it is a very reasonable pace, requiring only about 10 hours of math per week. \n\nBy contrast, most public schools have only about 180 school days per year and a significant proportion of those are devoted to testing as well as review after the summer break. Thus, only one book per year can be completed."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

CMV + \n + I know a lot of liberals are saying that women make 77 cents less than their male counterparts. However, I heard the libertarian's counter point and it's not that they are individually making less, it's just that women work less than men do as a whole. That being said, I want to say that **I am not a misogynist**, I believe women should be treated equally to men in what they do. So if a woman puts in as much hours, does as much work, and have as much education and experience she should be paid the same as a man with the same qualities. \n\nIt's just that as a whole, women tend to be the care-takers. They also (as a whole) tend to chose lesser paying jobs. Ie; There's more men in engineering sciences. And there's more women in social sciences (Ie; psychology, etc). I believe that women are capable at doing whatever they want, however, women (as a whole) tend to have interests in jobs that pay less than some men do. And that is the reason why there is a gender gap. I believe we have evolved as a society to not discriminate against someone based on gender and race (for the most part at least)."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I believe that racism, in the dictionary-defined sense of the word is virtually gone from American culture. Now are there always going to be some people that will hate other people for no reason? Yes. But my argument is that those people are few and far enough between, in addition to being discredited enough that they have a completely negligible pull on society. \n\nNow let me draw a clear delineation between racism and racial stereotyping/profiling; racism, again as used by its correct definition, is separated from profiling-type behaviors as racism is the belief that one race is inferior to another at its purest form. Stereotyping and profiling are prejudices based on statistics and facts, not color. These things obviously exist in **all** cultures. And I'm of the opinion that that isn't necessarily a bad thing. \n\nI'm interested to see if you guys can convince me that racism is still noticeably present in mainstream American culture, or even that it is a pressing issue that deserves more attention \n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It also has no bearing on their actual opinions on real things, because most people support equal rights for women, or support equal rights for men and women, and will occasionally turn a blind eye to privileges that women have and that men have because of societal and biological biases. \n\nPeople who call themselves feminists could hold completely opposing viewpoints:\n\nOne could be in favor of free birth control for women, and another could be in favor of free birth control for men and women, and another could be opposed to free birth control altogether, because it makes women dependent on a male-dominated state system.\n\nOne feminist could subscribe to privilege theory, another could find it completely absurd.\n\nOne might complain about objectification, one could utilize objectification to do some slut-shaming, and another might not approve of heterosexual relationships at all. \n\nOne could be in favor of incentives or quotas in colleges or workplaces to ensure that women are equally represented in certain fields, another could be opposed to that because it is benevolent sexism. \n\nI am having a very hard time finding one thing that feminists all agree on. The only  things I have thought of are as follows.\n\n-Women should be allowed to vote\n\n-Women are people\n\nNote that both of these statements are so acceptable within the culturethat people who despise feminism will still agree with the statement, with very few exceptions.\n\nMeanwhile, most people agree that socialism is either the state ownership of the means of production, or the workers owning the means of production. Most people agree that capitalism is where the means of production are held by private owners, generally for profit. Classical liberalism is a philosophy of limited government and personal liberty. Conservativism is when you support classical and traditional social structures. \n\nThese descriptives have meanings that, even though there are occasional disagreements, generally mean things. Feminism means almost nothing other than \"I think about gender issues\".\n\nPlease note, I am not here to be convinced that feminism is good or feminism is bad, just that the term, as an adjective, actually means something. \n\nChange my view.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2h21j2/cmv_feminism_as_a_descriptive_is_next_to_useless/ckorgmk?context=3\n\nThis is the most succinct definition or case put forward in this thread.\n\n\nI may disagree about the \"philosophical tradition\" aspect, as I am unaware of feminism grounded in any philosophy, but I think that it is true that a feminist has spent time examining and engaging with gender issues, and specifically related to women. This is simultaneously not vague as all hell, as it clearly applies to certain groups of people and not others, and also is a definition that could be agreed upon by most. "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

CMV. + \n + League of Legends is a game I believed plays based solely on catching opportunities and be able to do very small micromanagement (I will explain these this point later), and in order to succeed in knowing both these categories and execute them well, one need to have experiences in the realm of League game play, in simpler term, in order to be good at League one just need to play the game, the more they play the better they get at it. But when the matchmaking system pair experienced players with inexperienced ones, both parties expectations are not met because of their differences in skills thus both parties rage at one another.\n\nIn my personal experience with the match making system, more often than not, I get paired with newer players who have much less experience in the game, to clarify here is my stats:\n\n* 733 wins in normal\n\n* 345 wins in ranked\n\n* 720 game total in ranked\n\n\nWith a little over 1,400 games, anyone with similar experience would know where a ward should be place so that it would give the best vision, not just any place in the bush, it has to be in a certain area within the bush (top or bottom or middle of the bush depend on the the bush position in the map) and if a person is playing Alistar, they know to keep Riven away from the Adc. These are the very small micromanagement that I talked about, and having knowledge about these micro is a huge factor in deciding the game outcome.\n\nThus when an experienced player get into a team fight with the opposing team, he have a certain expectation of his team mates to do things that they are suppose to do. The key word here is expectation, every Adc expects their support to help them by either attacking the other priority target or by keeping the Dps and Assassin away from the Adc. Now again, these things are not taught in the tutorial and one must experienced it in the game in order to know this.\n\nWhen a player fail to meet these expectations, \"rage\" happens. The question often is \"Why?\" \"why didn't you do this, why didn't you do that\", they asks this because each player have an expectation of what another player should be doing, and each person's expectations is different based on their skill level in the game. An Adc with 50 games under his belt expects his support to act differently than an Adc with 400 games under his belt.\n\nThe issue with the match making system is that it paired experienced players with newer ones and the gaps are tremendous, (often I find my self playing with team mates less than 100 total wins in ranked, some even less than 30) and it is unfair to veteran players to lose a game because someone else is learning the rope.\n\nRage can happen to both parties, the experienced player and the inexperienced ones, some of the things that veterans of League does in a game (initiation, expecting follow ups, go for priority target) some time does not make sense to the inexperience players and vice-versa, so both parties rage at one another for not meeting their expectations.\n\nThe issue with the matchmaking system have been on my mind for a while now, I do not know if there are logistic in place for the matchmaking system or if it just match anyone to everyone, I just felt that this is a good place to put my thoughts process out there to see if anyone else think the same and I welcome any other ideas that would say other wise. I posted this in /r/leagueoflegends and did not get much respond or even a counter argument, I am hoping that it would be different here.\n\nTl:DR: Match making system pair experienced players with inexperienced players and everyone rage at each other for not doing what was expected from one another.\n\n\nThanks everyone for commenting, and a special thanks to /u/stipulation and /u/A_Soporific for adding onto the fundamental cause for rage of League of Legends."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Supposedly it allows us to solve poverty while reducing the size of government. We give everyone money with no discrimination and we don't have to tell them how to spend it, so food stamps and unemployment and whatever else just go away.\n\nI posit that UBI would lead to rampant inflation on certain essential goods and services (most specifically with regards to rent and mortgage) which would in turn lead to various price setting measures and restrictions on what the UBI could be used for; meaning we would still have the same types of government controls advocates of the UBI claim it would remove.\n\nSo take housing which I think is the most obvious example. Housing is a limited resource. We can only squeeze so many people into an area. Therefore there will always be a limited supply and landlords and bankers will be in a position to take advantage of the influx of cash now coming in through UBI. Even though people will have more money, they will still be spending the majority of it on rent or mortgages since the prices will go up.\n\nIn response to this situation I can see one of two scenarios playing out:\n\n1. Governments start exercising pricing controls on goods that are becoming too expensive in order to maintain a reasonable UBI.\n\n2. The UBI doesn't increase to match inflation (the same way minimum wage doesn't increase) and the system ends up not being effective anymore.\n\nAlso, even with UBI you will still have some poor people who stay poor because they spend all their money on stupid stuff like drugs and Dr. Dre headphones or whatever. Even if this is a minority the ones who don't like giving their tax money away will use them as an example the same way they do now for welfare subsidies and food stamps. \n\nI'm sorry, but I just don't see any problem being solved here. CMV\n\nSide note 1: A lot of people who argue against a universal basic income talk about people not being motivated to work. I make no claims about this argument; it seems like amateur psychology to me and I have no statement about it. \n\nSide note 2: I don't think UBI is \"socialism\", I think it is a market solution advocated by free market economists like Milton Friedman. Either way I have no position for or against socialism or free market economics, I am just arguing that it wouldn't solve the problems advocates of the idea say it would solve.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Many people like to do it for free.\n\nThis shouldn't raise moral issues as long as more blood is collected. \n\nSome might argue that it would increase the price of health. I don't know how much blood is needed, and how much it would cost to fill the gap. My guess is that the price of the treatment of expensive health troubles wouldn't really be affected.\n\nThe demand for blood does not depend on the supply. As a consequence price paid for blood should find a balance.\n\nOne problem could be that people who are not eligible for giving blood would still sell it. I am pretty sure additional tests are ran on the blood collected. you could just ban for life/X years people whose blood wasn't as clean as they claimed. I am not sure it is enough, but if some people are dying anyway they might be willing to take the risk.\n\nIf it is not allowed in many country, there is probably a good reason to it so plz CMV.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

These threats have enabled mainstream media coverage to create a straw man of any opposition to them and has poisoned the well for anyone who finds their views problematic that wants to have a public dialogue about them.

The narrative for almost all mainstream coverage of these women  universally supports them, and an inordinate portion of these articles focuses on harassment from a small group of psychopaths and trolls, which usually includes quotes of some of the most tasteless comments for shock value. Because of this, I believe that the threats and trolling these women have experienced has greatly helped their cause. People unfamiliar with the games industry who read these articles are led to believe that a large portion of those opposing these women are psychopath basement dwellers making rape threats. Because this narrative helps their movement so much, I believe that feminists who support the actions of these women can definitely help their movement by creating many fake, anonymous accounts and viciously threatening feminist public figures with them. Drawing from this, while hardcore members of Gamergate have undoubtedly trolled and threatened these women, I believe a decent portion of the vitriol against these women is posted by their supporters.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

CMV + \n + Hello /r/changemyview! I'm excited for my first submission. I also know that reddit as a whole is probably the most staunchly pro-vaccine community I've ever encountered and, if I'm being honest, this post is somewhat inspired by the [AskReddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1pb7e3/what_is_one_fact_that_despite_being_100_true_is/) that cropped up recently. I've been meaning to post this for a long time, though.\n\nOkay, so let me start by saying that I understand the urge to vaccinate everyone and that vaccines are only truly effective if everyone takes part. I will also acknowledge that I am by no means a medical professional and am probably less educated on the subject than many of you. So, those things are granted, no need to point them out. Now, as for my argument: I simply don't believe that vaccines are safe for everyone to use. Let me share a story with you:\n\nIn the summer before my junior year of high school, I was sitting in my basement playing video games one day when I felt a stroke of dizziness. I immediately turned the game off and went to get some water, only to find that I couldn't make it up the stairs. I fell over, head spinning, and called to my parents for help. They got me upstairs, at which point I threw up until there was nothing left in my stomach. I couldn't open my eyes without the world whirling by at an uncontrollable speed, so I kept my eyes closed while they took me to the emergency room.\n\nWhat I'm describing is something many of you may have experienced: vertigo. If I'm being honest, writing that made me a little anxious. For some time afterward, I would be anxious any time I got dizzy for any reason out of fear that I was lapsing back into vertigo. Anyway, I got to see a doctor and underwent numerous tests including an MRI (note: I think the test had a different name, but I can't remember exactly what it was and I know that it bore heavy resemblance to an MRI. Just think of it as a head scan). They couldn't tell what the cause was, but they suspected that (you know where I'm going with this) the vertigo was caused by the vaccine I had received before getting vertigo. The vaccine was for HPV, which I guess is a fairly recent development for males. \n\nWhatever protection was offered by that vaccine was simply not worth it. I lived with vertigo for a month, unable to stand up for long periods of time, or really do much besides lay in bed and try to comfort my stomach to the point where I could hydrate myself. I do not wish that upon anyone. That's why I'm against mandatory vaccinations for all, and why I disagree with people who tout the efficacy of vaccines as 100% fact. For that to be the top comment on an AskReddit thread is plainly ridiculous. \n\nJust a couple more things to consider: (1) every time I went in to see the doctor for subsequent check-ups, a nurse or a doctor would tell me that I still needed to take the second installment of the Gardasil HPV vaccine. I would tell them what happened, and they would instantly agree that I should stay away from the vaccine - a far more rational approach than many redditors seem to take, no? Just throwing it out there - I have been told by legitimate medical professionals not to take that vaccine. \n\n(2) I am *not* against vaccination. A couple years after the vertigo, I willingly received the vaccine for meningitis. But I did research the crap out of it beforehand. I will consider future vaccines in the same way - with open-mindedness and a healthy dose of skepticism.\n\n(3) I am *not* the only one who has suffered serious issues at the hands of this vaccine. I wrote a comment about this earlier, so I'm just going to reuse a link: [Here's](http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/stress-and-health-dr-lind/2013/apr/10/us-court-pays-6-million-gardasil-victims/) an article about it. Even some simple Googling will probably clue you in to the damage this vaccine has caused. Hopefully, when reading about lives that have been lost, you can see why it angers me when reddit gives thousands of upvotes and awards reddit gold to people who spew this sort of condescending, 'scientific' nonsense.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read. Alrighty then, CMV!"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

To make things easy, let's just ignore the cost and the amount down, since this is mostly about principles and general concepts.\n\nNow, the place is pretty crappy.  I decide to invest a good amount of my own cash to completely overhaul the place.  Hardwood floors, granite counters, etc.  I put some more money into landscaping the area around me because I want my property to look nice.\n\nAt this point, let's take a look at what I'm paying:\n\n1) Money down on the house.\n\n2) Interest on a 30 year loan.\n\n3) Sales tax for all the raw materials I paid for during the renovation.\n\n4) Labor costs if I hire a contractor to do the work, or time from my day if I do it myself.\n\nBUT!\n\nI also now have to pay PROPERTY TAXES!  In other words--in the most very basic sense--not only do I have to pay for the actual place that I live, but I have to pay for the RIGHT to HAVE a place to live.  And even though I've thrown out my own money into making it a nicer place, I'm now inflating the property's value, and will therefore have to pay even greater property taxes as a result.\n\nAt the start of the venture, I owed a nominal amount to the State in property taxes.  After renovating (which, by the way, means that the State gained both sales tax from materials purchased as well as the State's share of income tax if I hired someone else to do it), I have increased the value, which means I have to pay even MORE money for the privilege of having a place to sleep.\n\nI really do not understand this.

I consider this a pathetic attempt to rationalize guilt for the weak who would have otherwise likely died in the struggle for resources before the food chain was handled for them.  They shed a metaphorical tear for an animal that would stampede over their head without a second thought.\n\nAlso recent posts about the \"travesty\" of dogs wandering the streets in Russia during the Olympics.

We lock them in a cage, where at their age no one adopts them, so we put them down.\n\nI'd say in that case Russia is the real animal rights advocate, at least for dogs.

It is absolutely ludicrous that we try to shield children from the reality of the wild.  The action taken was clearly the best coarse for the zoo, the animal and for the children and parents who chose to view such a thing.\n\nBut these weak actors that have trouble rationalizing the food chain that is handled for them cry for no other reason that they are weak in a world run by the strong and are unable to rationalize the brutality of existence. \n\nTo be clear I do not participate in such a thing and consider such behavior to be of weak personal standing.  No different than someone who abuses a child.\n\nBut we don't eat children.  We don't systematically kill them.  \n \nIf we systematically ate and killed children I'd feel the same way about child cruelty laws. "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I generally think that most drugs should be legal, but also there has not been nearly enough research on steroids for them to be a class III drug. If the government wants to ban something, I think they have an obligation to prove scientifically why it is necessary. They have not done that and they are not funding any research to eventually prove that.

I used to be one of those guys but I am not anymore. But I WANT to be that nice guy.\n\nI (19m) was raised thinking that I would find a nice girl who I could spend the rest of my life with. Someone who I could just love for who they are as a person (and vice versa) and that no matter what happened we would always stick together. However recently I've given up on this.  My entire life I was the stereotypical \"nice guy\" who always cared about the feelings of others, so much so that I would invite kids sitting alone at lunch to my table, I would hang out with my friends if they seemed like they needed someone to talk to, etc. \n\nMy mom instilled in me from a very young age that above all I should respect women and that was the way to find love. Hold the door open for her, be polite and courteous,buy her flowers, etc. Anyways, last year I met what seemed like the perfect girl. Beautiful, funny, ditzy, intelligent, basically everything I could ever want in a girl. Back then I believed there was a distinction between party rats and nice girls, and she seemed to embody essentially everything about the \"nice girl\". Well we made plans to hang out one night and she flaked on me. Then I found out the reason that she flaked: to fuck the football teams 5th string running back who was known around campus as a player and had fucked like 10 girls already (first 2 months of college). I stopped talking to her after that. As soon as she found a \"better option\" she just left me in the dust and never showed any regret for ditching me.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is this: most girls I have met in college have behaved this way. Even the ones I would never expect it from, and the ones who said they \"weren't that girl\" and \"wanted a nice guy\". I used to laugh at nice guys on the internet but now I really feel for them. I'm not ugly by any means and I've had a little success but it was only when I pretended to be someone who I'm not and basically acted like the girl didn't exist until the night we hooked up. I HATE acting like this but based on my experiences it seems like the only way. Do women really hope to find a nice guy? Because I'm calling bullshit. Change my view.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Since these are often contracted by for-profit companies that get a cut of each fine, the companies often get the yellow light signals shortened. The city doesn't care since it gets a cut as well. The two main arguments against this are\n\n1. It makes things more dangerous\n2. They are gouging drivers\n\nI think these arguments are irrelevant.\n\nShortening the yellow may well lead to more rear-end collisions as a driver brakes suddenly and the driver behind them doesn't brake fast enough. Well, this will reduce accidents in the long run. Cars are supposed to leave sufficient space between each other to allow sudden stops. Obviously the second car either didn't leave enough space or wasn't paying attention. When the determination of fault occurs the second driver will receive plenty of blame and hence suffer larger insurance payments. If they do this enough times, no one will provide them insurance and they'll then be forced to give up driving, which forces a dangerous driver off the roads. This is a win for safety (since the driver can no longer run over pedestrians and bicyclists).\n\nSo in essence, the accidents that are being caused are simply pointing out those drivers that are irresponsible anyways. And far better for them to rear-end another car that is stopping due to a traffic light than one that stops suddenly due to a child running out into the street, then the second car pushes the first onto the child. Or hit a pedestrian, bicyclist, or other innocent person.\n\nThe other argument is that the city is gouging drivers. Maybe so, but it's only restoring a bit of balance between driving and other modes of transportation. Drivers don't pay for all the pollution they emit, or for roads (gas tax doesn't cover everything), or for the tens of thousands they murder every year, or for the higher medical costs bought about by their driving (lack of exercise leads to obesity), or a million other things. Hence everyone else, who has better things to do than drive everywhere, are forced to subsidize drivers in their irresponsible choices. The cameras may be unfair in that some drivers will get closer to paying their fair share, but since they're all drastically underpaying, no driver is actually being gouged."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

One of these officers has invoked their Fifth Amendment rights to avoid self-incrimination.\n\n\nIt just inherently sounds wrong to me and I\u2019ll try to explain why through this thought process:\n\n- Police officers are given authority over civilians through virtue of enforcing the law.\n\n- With great power comes great responsibility. They have more power than the average person, so they should be held to a higher standard. Police officers are supposed to enforce the law, so they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to impede it.\n\n- Police officers get power and authority. Civilians are subject to this authority and therefore have certain rights and protections against it. You can\u2019t have it both ways. You can\u2019t have both power/authority AND protections from it.

This is true whether the concept is used correctly, as in when a US citizen says \"I have the right to freedom of speech\", or incorrectly as in when a US citizen says \"You have no right to say that\" when that person does have a legal right to do so.\n\nAn assertion of a right in a debate begs the question, and is often used as rhetorical gloss so the speaker does not have to justify their point of view. As a case in point, on a British panel show called Question Time a woman said that the public \"had the right to know\" whether Tony Blair promised George Bush to join the coalition against Iraq. In doing so she avoided having to explain why the public deserved to know such things, and what the parameters of that alleged right were. \n\nDespite the generally move towards secularism there appears to be a sense that rights are, if not God given, certainly outside the realm of worldly debate.

Transformers 4 (the highest grossing film worldwide) made roughly 15 times its production cost back. So, Planes 2 is the most successful film this year.**\n\n*****\n\nWhile arbitrary, I define financial success as the cumulative revenue a film is responsible for generating (box office, merchandising, secondary markets) as a multiple of its production cost. I also eliminate films costing minimal amounts of money to produce (e.g., a youtube video or independent film not in wide release).\n\nAs a target, the highest grossing film worldwide was Transformers: Age of Extinction, which [grossed] (http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Transformers-Age-of-Extinction#tab=summary) approximately 1.137 billion in its initial worldwide release and domestic US DVD and Blu-ray sales.  Additionally, lets assume that the film grosses another 87 million in worldwide secondary sales, and around 2 billion in merchandising in the next few years. These figures aren't public, but are based on estimates from the original trilogy published by [Variety] (http://variety.com/2014/film/news/transformers-the-anatomy-of-a-cross-platform-money-maker-1201245881/). Transformers [cost] (http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=transformers4.htm) $210 million to make. So, **Transformer's 4's revenue:production cost ratio is around 15.2** (3.2b:210m).\n\nTo beat this figure, Planes: Fire and Rescue would have to have a cumulative revenue more than $760 million (15.2 x [its production cost] (http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=planes2.htm) of $50 million).\n\nWe know that its [worldwide box office] (http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=planes2.htm) was $147 million. It [made] (http://www.the-numbers.com/weekly-video-sales-chart) 22 million in domestic US blu-ray and dvd sales. Additionally, using a traditional international dvd/blu-ray sales multipler, we can estimate roughly 35 million of international sales. So cumulatively, the film has made roughly $204 million from box office and secondary markets.\n\nNow, the film would have to make roughly $556 million from merchandising in order to pass Transformers 4 in revenue:production cost ratio. I would argue that this film will do so easily. Data shows that the Cars series (averaged) [http://www.cnbc.com/id/43525949]. 2 billion per year. The original Cars film made $10 billion in merchandising in 5 years (see previous cite). This $2 billion estimate was also made before Disney expanded its theme parks to include Cars-specific attractions. It is unclear if the Cars/Planes series is still generating $2/yr, and $10 billion/film. However, the merchandising channels have been plowed by former films, and Disney is primed to take advantage of the release of Planes films. So, it would not be unrealistic to think that Planes 2 would generate at least 10% of the merchandising revenue generated by Cars. If Planes 2 generates a mere 10% of the merchandising revenue that Cars 1 generated, it would generate **1.2 billion** in total box office, dvd + bluray, and merchandising. **This gives it a 24-times revenue:production cost ratio, about 1.6 times Transformers 4's ratio of 15.**\n\nTherefore, Planes 2 is likely the most financially successful film of the year. If its merchandising is greater than 10% of Cars 1's total, then it may have been much more successful than any other film this year.\n\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

CMV + \n + My understanding is that when someone buys shares of a company, they are purchasing a share of the equity of that company, not actually putting any money toward the growth of the company itself. When you buy a share or even 1,000 shares, your money is only going toward the previous shareholder, NOT the company.\n\nMy understanding is that the only situation your money actually is invested in the company, is when you are purchasing brand new shares, which only happens when the company is in a crisis and needs to acquire funding from investors. So, when you buy already existing shares, you are merely purchasing ownership of a part of the profit when the business eventually does grow larger and gain more equity. So, while some shareholders may have been the original investors that powered up a business that came to prosper, many of them are just wealthy people who purchased a certificate that says they get extra money if the company makes extra money...and none of their investment actually goes toward acquiring assets for the company. \n\nSo, if this is correct.. Where exactly does the perceived authority of shareholders come from? Yes, I understand they are sharing \"ownership\" of the company. But really, they are only sharing profit. Why do large corporations put more priority into pleasing the shareholders instead of the employees and customers? Especially the very large, rich, corporations whose employees work for hardly-livable wages and few if any benefits? Why are most large chain retail stores running on a skeleton crew having to spread themselves thin and compromise quality and customer service? If shareholders became unhappy and sold their shares, the company would still be making the same profit. Worst-case scenario, if everybody stated selling their shares, the price/share may drop. But that doesn't mean the company is losing money, it just has to share it's profits with less (or more) people. As long as a company's assets are greater than it's debts, the company is profitable. Prices per share only matter because of networks of companies owning eachother's shares and calling them \"assets\" so their equity is inflated by this imaginary value of how much a company's stock may sell for.. It's like a delicate castle of cards based on hypothetical values. It doesn't make sense as a long term foundation for a business. \nTLDR: Shareholders are not actively contributing money to a company. I do not think that pleasing the shareholders should be the priority of a company.\n\nChange my view."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I wanted to spread the peanut butter first, but I realized that by spreading peanut butter and then using the same knife in the jelly, I would be adding peanuts to the jelly.

I'm not talking about paparazzi, which in my opinion is closer to stalking or harassment. I'm also not referring to government surveillance, which can involve tracking or data collection beyond a simple photograph or video recording. I'm specifically talking about a scenario like this:\n\nPerson A is walking in a public park with lots of people around. Person B is sitting on a park bench. Person A sees a bird in a tree he/she would like to photograph. This tree is directly behind the park bench person B is sitting on. Person A raises the camera to photograph the bird, at which point person B objects to having their photo taken, rather than simply obscuring their face or moving. \n\nNow I understand that it may make people uncomfortable knowing that they are the subject being captured on film, but if you are willingly in a public place with many people around, I feel that it's understood that many pictures may be taken, and that you may be in some of them. The idea that a photographer needs to ask permission from everyone that may be in any given picture is absurd. I say this from personal experience, as well as other examples from around the web, a good one being [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/27m68v/crazed_woman_attacks_man_for_flying_drone_on_beach/).\n\nThis woman chose to go to a public place, and was then offended when someone else at the public place had a camera. Never mind the assault charges, I believe she had no right to confront the person about it.\n\nEssentially it boils down to a person attempting to deprive someone of the ability to photograph and observe freely simply because they are indirectly affected with no real harm done. Being photographed does not damage a person in any way, other than possibly making them uncomfortable for a few minutes. It's similar in a way to being offended at an interracial or gay couple in a public place in my mind; just because you don't like it doesn't mean everyone else has to change their behavior for you. \n\nBut maybe I'm missing something, so Reddit feel free to CMV!\n\n\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

After thinking about it, it came to my mind that probably this is due to the people's demand to redistribute the income/having government paid jobs/sectors of the economy. In a way, I think this could be a result of the principle of a democracy. By definition, the amount of poorer people is much higher as the amount of rich people, as the groups are referred to as bottom/top 20% of National Income. Naturally, the bottom 20% (or more this is just an example) can easily abuse their power in elections to basically \"steal\" money from the top 20% through the government and completely legally. This should then happen in every democracy with a relatively free market. So in theory, this potential for the bottom 20% to live on the top 20% expense (in the short run ofc) is always there and therefore will eventually lead to socialism. I hope, it is not like this, as I think democracy is indeed a much better way for a state to be governed than through a dictatorship/monarchy etc... pls CMV!"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I'll include a TL;DR. Also, while I'm using myself as an example, that's both due to some personal experiences and to make writing this easier. This is not about \"me\", per se. \n\n**TL;DR: Ultimately, people on the internet are still that - people. What this means is that any online interaction, friendship and obligation, involves real people and should be held to the same standards as offline interactions. What you wouldn't do someone in \"real life\" should also not be done online, be in a forum or elsewhere. This doesn't mean the internet is \"more\" or \"less\" important than offline interactions; it means that both are important and \"it's just the internet\" is not an excuse to diminish relationships, be impolite, not take things seriously when you're expected to, constantly bail out on stuff you've agreed to do and such.**\n\n\nTo start with a simple example I believe most people will agree with, people should try their best to be polite in any online interactions. This includes discussions and such. You don't randomly offend someone in a bar table because he disagrees with you, and you shouldn't do that online either. Of course, sometimes discussions can get heated and \"shit hits the fan\", but that feels like the default state of any discussion online, and I believe that the main reason for that (and everything else I mention here), is because most people either fail to realize that they're dealing with another PERSON on the other end, or simply don't care. That just shouldn't happen. \n\nAnother example I want to tackle is online friendships. These, I feel, are almost universally seen as \"inferior\" to real life ones and shouldn't be prioritized over \"real life\" interactions, no matter the context, and I really have to ask why is that so. I'm not saying that if you have a bunch of online friends and have \"no need\" for real life interactions, I'm just saying that an online friend is still, for all intent and purposes, a \"friend\". And it's all right to prioritize said friend over a real life social event if you are that close with him, just like you would probably prioritize going to your best friend's birthday party instead of go out drinking with your co-workers, if both events are scheduled at the same time. That it's all right to confide things or  ask a a really close, decade old online friend, for help and such. It's okay if your \"best\" friends live far away. They're not necessarily inferior to RL ones. \n\nTo give a personal example, I have a very tight group of online friends that I interact with on a daily basis. We know each other for almost 10 years. Some of us married, moved to a different country, live too far to reasonably have any chance to meet offline, and still, we're extremely close. Just like any social group, some are closer than others, a few of them easily being my \"best\" friends. If that group wants to have a skype conference on a friday night just to mess around and talk, yes, I will prioritize it over pretty much any non-emergency RL event. If someone at work calls me to a happy hour, \"sorry but I already have plans\" is my answer. I feel a lot of people disagree with this, because they see real life interactions as inherently more important\". In this example I gave, no, they are not. If it's someone's birthday party, or wedding, or any other kind of \"major\" event, then maybe I would give it priority. But, as you can see, I'm comparing things on a case by case basis, and not just \"AH, it's just my internet 'friends', they don't matter\". They matter just as much as any other person I have a similarly close relationship with. They're people.\n\nThis also extends to what I believe is my most \"controversial\" opnion, and that's about internet \"obligations\". What I mean with this is, if you agree to do something for someone on the internet, again the standards should be the same as when you do so offiline. It would be assholish back out an appointment for minor reasons in RL and that standard should also be applied online.\n\nFor example, say you join a team or guild for some online game. You agree to meet Wednesdays and Thursdays 8PM. \n\nThen you miss a day without warning because there was a sports game you wanted to watch. You miss another day because you just weren't feeling like it. And another because you agreed to help your neighbour move a sofa in his house or something. Then you agreed to go to the bar when you knew you have to be available somewhere else at that time. I'm sorry, but that's assholish. \n\nI believe most people would not flak out on, say, a minor neighbourhood soccer team's game because of said reasons. Doing so would be rude to your team and screw them up. They would not be able to play the game, or have to find an inferior replacement not used to the team, and that would impact their enjoyment and performance. Guess what? THE EXACT same things happens to the online gaming group. But, again, because they're seen as \"not as important\" as real life, it's suddenly \"ok\" to do so. \n\nNote that I'm not advocating you to raid with your WoW guild or w/e when your SO wants to have some time with you on that particular day, or a major event demands your attention. But wouldn't that kind of major situation also make you miss playing with your \"soccer team\"? And using the soccer team example once again, if you know you have to be with them X days at Y times, you will likely try to make your other obligations and events not happen at the same time. You'll see if you can change the time, make it ealier or latter, change the day and so on. You won't always be able to, of course, but my point, once again, is that people should evaluate things on a case by case scenario, and that it's wrong and perhaps even assholish to always put internet relationships \"last\" on your social priorities list. \n\n*When you screw people online, ignore them, are inpolite, bail out of stuff you agreed to do with them and treat your relationship with them as inherently less important than everything else, you're treating PEOPLE as less important, for a reason that I simply can't agree with.*\n\n\n*I am saying you should not devalue online relationships and obligations just because they're online, putting them \"always last place\" regardless of the impact this might have on the online people that you interact with and your relationship with them. I'm saying that it's not wrong to prioritize important online friends over RL events that are not as important to you*\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Their presence in the political debate really overshadows people who have extensive knowledge on the subject and blights academic findings over feel good over the top statements that everyone wants to hear.

Why shackle yourself with seeds you have to buy every year, to only one producer who has absolute control over the pricing?\n\nMaybe it's because Monsanto seeds are more productive. Like, so much more productive that it covers the high cost of seed aquisition. In this case, why are people complaining? Again, in every industry, if you want to use closed tech to increase your productivity, then you have to pay for a license and you are not allowed to redistribute the tech because it is patented.

They make gobs of money off of 'student athletes', and the situation is slanted very much to their benefit. It's a bad deal. My second assertion is the one I most want to see people argue: No one forced anyone to get involved, and it's at least somewhat your own dumb decision that you did. And players who got the short end of the stick are not necessarily 'owed' anything for it.\n\nThe NCAA makes you sign an agreement. You don't have to sign it. You don't have to take the scholarship. You can go to college based on what most of us non-athlete types had to: The strength of your academic success. You made a risky, possibly dumbass move, and now, there are consequences built into that. Perhaps tragically so, but your decision all the same. \n\nAnd reality is that there is a high risk/high reward process at work here, which people are to some extent *willing* to engage in for a shot at the reward. They take the raw deal, because they're hoping to be one of the few who gets to be a professional athlete who makes millions and millions of dollars, and are willing to take certain risks to get there. It's the same reason why gobs of people try to be Hollywood actors, a profession that offers crap pay and a 2% employment rate: They're all dreaming of being Tom Cruise, and are willing to take the inherent risk/reward involved for a shot at it. Whether these are rational decisions is beside the point, as it's their life, right?\n\nHBO's Real Sports also recently did an expose on NFL cheerleaders. The jist is that NFL cheerleaders make almost no money, have to pay for their own equipment, are forced to endure very strict rules, and generally it's a shi##y existence. It all sounds terrible, and makes you mad at the powers that be 'exploiting' these cheerleaders, but then you have to wonder: If it's so terrible, why do loads of cheerleader hopefuls still keep showing up for tryouts? No one's forcing them to, right? The powers that be can get away with it it because young women are *willing* to keep showing up for tryouts regardless. Basic supply and demand in effect.\n\nAt the end of the day, how much can we really save people from themselves? There's obviously a deeper social and economic issue here we can get into, but for now let's keep it to sports: Why is it not enough to simply say, \"The NCAA is a a bad deal, we recommend you do something else\"? Why do we need, as some are proposing, a law they requires the NCAA to change its practices? Unless they're engaging in fraud, what else do we need to police?\n\nAlso, a question I realized goes along with all this: Maybe the problem is just that we celebrate sports too much? After all, it's just a game. But we've built so much importance into it that people dream, just like Hollywood, of the glamor and fame and 'greatness' our culture has deemed go into it all. Maybe it's ourselves as much as the NCAA that are at fault here?"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Occasionally, I find them outright misleading, such as the recent hoopla over \"temperatures flat for the last 15 years\", when 1998 was an unusually warm year, and the conclusion would be different if we examined the last 14 or 16 years.\n\nAnalyzing data and drawing conclusions, finding ways to separate the obscure truth from bullshit is a major part of what I do for a living.

It's like if I went to a Chinese restaurant buffet, and every tray was full of spring rolls. I like spring rolls, but I like other stuff too, and I'd get pretty damn sick of spring rolls real fast.\n\nNow, that being said, I think 99% of the usage today is lazy and pretentious, throws dirt on the face of a millennia-old poetic tradition, and is rapidly dissociating poetry from having any bearing or purpose outside of a rarefied circlejerk of snobs, hipsters, and editors of the New Yorker. Fundamentally, poetry is a recognition that we derive meaning from the aspects of language beyond the simple meaning of the words themselves, such as the sounds and shapes and interactions of those words. Modern free verse recognizes none of this, and has thus lost its power to compel, or indeed have any relevance to an ordinary person.

Political Correctness/Tolerance is possibly worse than elitism(May not be the right word). + \n + Alright, so there are two main views I currently have. \n\nThe first is that the current levels of Political Correctness/Tolerance most countries have, especially in Europe, is detrimental to society, seen as how ISIS is actively allowed to recruit in the streets and how the government of certain countries are afraid to punish Muslims for committing Rape  (I believe there were stories about Denmark for instance.) and hate crimes (The most recent that come to mind are attacks on Israelis in Europe by Muslims). Simply put, it is allowing horrible, even socially destroying, ideas to be nurtured.\n\n\nAlright, this view is a bit more challengeable I would say and quite more extreme. The current levels of PC/Tolerance are even worse for society than elitism. This is because PC/Tolerance actually causes society to digress instead of progressing. Elitism, I will define it as people being given less leeway for having flaws/not contributing to society. The extreme version would be how the Nazis were elitist in that only Blond Blue Eyed ~~Aztecs (The race they used escapes me at the moment, but it started with A)~~ Aryans! were upheld while all others were seen as inferior, with people with disabilities being persecuted and especially those of other races/religion. That is naturally too extreme however. The elitism I am talking about is elitism of ideas. This would mean a hard crackdown on ideals such as the ISIS, Communism, Anarchy groups and the like as they are threats to society's overall morality and peace of mind. I understand this has problems in itself, especially for those who advocate more \"liberal\" ideals and identities such as LGBT as it promotes close-mindedness but given that the current state of the world, it probably would not affect them too much and probably wouldn't warrant a government crackdown as it doesn't pose an imminent threat to peace or society. The bigger problem I would see is strikes and such movements that protest the government can be labelled as \"disruptive\" but eh, governments seem to do that right now regardless of Tolerance or Political Correctness anyhow. Simply put, the Elitism I describe is more of a society that points out and punishes flaws in the thinking or actions of people compared to the one of now. \n\n\n\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

So when the first part introduces a bill on law A the second party will tack on law B in hopes that the first wants law A to pass so badly that they'll be willing to allow law B to slip through. A recent example was anti abortion legislation being grouped in with motorcycle safety laws.\n\nI find this disruptive to the process.

CMV. + \n + It used to be that marriage was a political or economic arrangement. One family would essentially sell their daughter to another for political or economic reasons. Sometimes, they might have done it to improve their social standing. But it wasn't something that a man and woman did for love. They may have learned to love each other later, but they didn't love each other when they married.  \n\nFortunately, we no longer approve of the dowry system. And people seem to believe that marrying for love is better than arranged marriages - that it's a sign of progress. I disagree.  \n\nWhile I certainly don't think it's right to see or treat your child, especially your daughter, as a piece of property to be sold or traded for political, economic, or social reasons, I do think that children owe something to their parents. Your parents brought you into this world. Ideally, they clothed you, fed you, paid for your education, taught you the right things, loved you, and sheltered you. To me, it just seems selfish to say \"Welp, thanks for everything. Now I'm gonna make this major life decision without your approval.\" Marrying someone your parents don't like seems selfish to me. They've given so much to you - again, ideally - I think it's only fair to give them something back.  \n\nBesides, arranged marriages aren't formed by two people lost in emotion. When people marry for love, like in the west, they tend to see each other through rose-colored glasses. They don't see each other realistically and they idealize each other. They get married in a rush and then, later on, find out that they're incompatible and end up getting divorced. By contrast, arranged marriages are set up by two people who aren't lost in emotion but are genuinely looking out for their children's best interests. They look at more important things like financial stability and education background. It's kind of like when a kid wants to eat only pizza and ice cream but his/her parents give the kid healthy nutritious food instead.  \n\nThe statistics bear me out, as well. Generally speaking, arranged marriages tend to have lower divorce rates (less than 2% in India, I think), and lower rates of infidelity and abuse. Meanwhile, half of marriages formed on the basis of love (especially in the US) end in divorce and infidelity and abuse run rampant in the west.  \n\nWe tend to think that acceptance marrying for love is a sign of progress. But I don't think it is. I think it's a fundamental breakdown of the family."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In a time when allegations of grade inflation run rampant, an abundance of A's and B's in a course can raise red-flags. Furthermore, even if the courses are graded on curves -- so that the number of A's and B's is kept reasonably low -- employers and graduate programs may become skeptical of the rigor of an undergraduate program if they find that their 3.7\u20134.0 students fizzle out.

The argument is more nuanced than that, and many truly believe in trickle down economics. \n\nI want to be more specific though. I fully understand that tax cuts can stimulate the economy  when taxes on the rich are incredibly high as it will give more financial leeway to philanthropists and the ability to leverage their money into other businesses thus creating (and funding) more business. So tax cuts when the rates have been really high (post wwII for example) makes sense. Even with Reagan they were relatively high before his cuts, and the economy did do well. But it's been the same message year after year by republicans. Even with income inequality with the highest it's been since the taxes were this low (pre WW2 Great Depression era). What gives?

I vehemently disagree. 100 years of social pressure did nothing to force the South to desegregate. 100 years of social pressure has done nothing to alleviate Japanese xenophobia. Like crime, murder, and theft, racism is one of those qualities that can never be completely eliminated, only suppressed via government force. Moreover, a Libertarian mindset is the *worst possible* to try to socially pressure people to conform to ethical standards. The vast majority of Libertarians are against any sort of social conformity (excluding social expectations on the concept of their property). \n\n\nWhat will actually happen if racism (in terms of discrimination on housing, employment, and public services) is legalized, is that the free market will react to the demand of racist services. Markets will react by opening up segregated shops and restaurants. Homeowner associations will open up segregated housing units and neighborhoods. As society becomes more segregated, racism will become normalized once again and we will be right back in the social situation of 1950. People will grow up with a life where the only people they know are the same race because they grew up in a segregated neighborhood, and attended a segregated private school, and got a job at a segregated business. They will label minorities as the \"Other\", because minorities will indeed become the \"Other\" when you have absolutely no experience with them.\n\nThe country will become divided up into those that tolerate other races and those that don't. Nonconformists will be forced to move when businesses, social clubs, and homeowner's associations impose trade sanctions on either racists or non-racists. Because the majority race has the most economic power, these trade sanctions will one-sided and thus be most damaging to minorities.\n\n\"Oh but this will never happen!\" Yes it will. The more important question is on *what kind of scale*? Will this discrimination only happen in isolated areas? Will it be so small to be negligible? Or will it become widespread and eventually become the norm, like it has in so many other countries? \n\nI tire of discussions of natural rights and how Libertarians treat everyone with equality, because everyone is allowed to discriminate equally! Please don't bring those up, I find them completely unconvincing. The only things that will convince me are practical, utilitarian, or empirical arguments. Tell me why the society that condones racism is \"better\", especially for minorities.

CMV.\n\nLet me start off by saying I am a poor college student with a mother who is an avid chef and a family who is always open to trying new and interesting foods. Simply stated: we are a food family. We love it. So, I was lucky enough to be introduced to the glory that is Trader Joe\u2019s at a young age and again in a mom-led grocery store tutorial (highly recommended for all students attempting to cook) as a college freshman. \n\nTrader Joe\u2019s is unique, affordable, exotic and customer-oriented. The colorful, fun and seasonal displays draw customers in for the $1.99 \u201cTrader Giotto\u2019s\u201d Italian pasta sauce or those $3.00 candy cane Joe Joe\u2019s (so much better than Oreos). The friendly, smiling staff is decked out in Hawaiian shirts and leis. \n\nTrader Joe\u2019s has an entire aisle of chocolate covered things: potato chips, pomegranate seeds, soybeans, almonds, you name it. A gourmet microwaveable filet of sole with a medley of vegetables? I\u2019ll take it. The aisles of $5.99 house-made wines with funny names\u2014perfect (for when I turn 21, of course). Trader ____ you name it has the best Asian, Indian, Mexican etc. foods you could imagine. Cookie butter sound good? Or should I just ask if you\u2019re a human? $2.99. Read the description. All of Trader Joe\u2019s products have a \u201cstory,\u201d and many are found on their website. \n\nSelf-dubbed \u201cYour Neighborhood Store,\u201d Trader Joe\u2019s accommodates donation requests in each individual store and donates products to food banks and soup kitchens daily. There are handy stamps on each product indicating nutrition information and characteristics such as fat free, quick meals, vegan and Kosher products among others, making it easy for shoppers with food restrictions to choose items. \n\nThose who do not think Trader Joe\u2019s is America\u2019s best grocery store chain might say it is overpriced or its products are superfluous. However, the stores offer a unique and fun shopping experience and hundreds of high quality products at low prices. They buy wholesale to ensure cheap pricing and many products are organic.\n\nTrader Joe\u2019s website reminds, \u201cShopping is like dating. You start by determining a unique set of attributes that will satisfy your desires, and then you look.\u201d If grocery shopping is dating, Trader Joe is my steady boyfriend and my one and only. \n\nChange my view."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The inconvenience (if it really can even be considered as an inconvenience) should be equal.\n\nI hold this belief because every time I am over at any house where there are one or more females there, it seems to be a huge fucking problem if I leave the toilet seat up instead of putting it back down into a closed or pooping position.\n\n I don't understand how this is such a huge deal because first of all, it's much easier to put the seat back down than it is to lift it up (which I had to do). Secondly, its just a goddamn toilet seat and its not that gross (just wash your hands). My third point is this. If I had to pick the seat up and put it in that position so I could use the toilet, its only equal that girls should have to put it back down so they can pee.\n\nIncidentally, the same girls who freak out about the toilet seat are very firm believers in how gender roles are stupid and everything between men and women should be made equal. Except when it comes to the toilet seat, because when a lesson in actual equality is looking then right in the face, THEY DONT FUCKING LIKE IT. Men are just disgusting pigs and we will never learn how to please our ladies, all fedora tipping aside.\n\nIf you can tell, I am a little steamed up by this.

Furthermore, I tend to only really see this quote come up when internet surveillance is in question.\n\nIn the end my view is that if Benjamin Franklin were alive today, his views would probably be entirely different regarding security. We live in a world where technology is advancing so quickly that our political ethics is having a hard time keeping up, and to me it makes absolutely no sense to cling on to outdated, seemingly naive traditional thoughts.

I took the stance that during the Civil Rights era, Martin Luther King Jr. was more successful than Malcolm X because he took a more tempered approach, presenting arguments that simply could not be denied, and using tactics like sit-ins to prove the brutality of the oppression by the racists of the era rather than using offensive tactics to get the oppressors to back down in submission. If I recall correctly, my friend argued that he was successful because he did not in fact take a tempered approach, but instead that his tactics were very in-your-face, citing his quote that freedom cannot be attained by simply asking. (NB: I pretty much just talking about civil rights, here. Political and economic inequality are somewhat different issues)\n\nHere's a basic outline of my position and the opposing one:\n\nMy belief:\n\n- Equality for any oppressed group can only logically happen if the enough of the oppressors realize their fault and change\n\n- Ignorance breeds intolerance, and therefore education breeds tolerance\n\n- In the case of the Feminist movement, activists should work to make society aware of problems and favor hard data to rhetoric (not that rhetoric isn't useful)\n\n- You're better served by telling someone why they're wrong than by berating them\n\n- Criticize the action rather than the person. For example: tell someone that what they did was racist, not that they're racist and they should feel ashamed (even if they are)\n\n- Equality not only means being able to achieve the same result as another person, but being able to achieve it with the same ease/difficulty\n\nOpposing belief:\n\n- Equality for any oppressed group can only be achieved by empowerment of the oppressed group, enabling them to go their own way\n\n- Gains need to be won without any connection with the oppressor, because they're not going to help. If they were, they wouldn't be oppressors\n\n- Feminist activists should take what's rightfully theirs instead of waiting for it to be handed over to them\n\n- You're better off berating someone who practices intolerance to express the seriousness of what they've done\n\n- Criticizing an intolerant person's character might make them reconsider their positions\n\n- Activists have been trying to educate for a long time, and the hate is still flowing\n\n*TL;DR - What serves modern movements like the fights for women's and minority rights better: the approach of MLK or that of Malcolm X?*\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It is used for many things.  One of the things we use taxation for is to protect goods grown/made/located in our community, guiding how your community spends its money and as a sort of punishment to other communities.\n\nLets take an example, in Norway there are massive taxes on cars.  It is based on a few things, but long story short, a car that costs $30,000 USD in the US could cost $90,000 USD in Norway.  They tax based on a few things, one is engine size.\n\nThis is used to punish people for being wasteful (inefficient cars, cars which pollute more) and also to make electric cars much more affordable since they are almost completely untaxed.  This is one of the reasons that Norway has the largest number of electric cars per capita (1% of the population, where US is 0.07% of the population).  This system would utterly collapse if, say, cars could be sold from outside of Norway to people in Norway without abiding by these taxes.\n\nNow this is not something I am asking for your agreement on.  This is just a reality, taxes CAN be used this way and some places do.  Whether you agree in principal of using it like this is not what I am asking.\n\nI see the world as hundreds of countries/states running small experiments on how to build a country.  Some of these are succeeding and others are not.  Countries must be able to control their experiments without being subverted from outside.\n\nNow certainly the states are not individual countries, but the inability to tax other states goods is also holding back states that are attempting to adopt ideas that effectively are more expensive, but also more \"fair\" (I realize after posting this isn't a good phrase, I should say more expensive, but the community has decided to give it a shot, and they should be allowed to conduct that experiment without complete subversion from other communities).\n\nFor example, if you raise the minimum wage in one state, raise taxes or other things in order to support a system, many companies threaten to relocate(assuming they can) or close.  They did this sort of stuff with the Affordable Health Act (though I don't know how many actually followed through).  Now companies should have the liberty to move and relocate.  But I also think that if a company moves to exploit the lower wages, less regulation, less social services, etc of another area, that the original state has a right to tax that company based on these factors.\n\nNow this certainly is not a straight forward thing.  But just as we allow Norway to tax cars being brought in from other countries, the citizens of each state should be allowed to guide their communities as well.  Maybe some states will decide not to, sure thats fine, but if you want to you should be able to, at least in some ways."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Over the past 24 hours I have seen so many bullshit posts on facebook about this.  Being from the south, all of my old friends are posting articles from \"conservative weekly\" about how the verdict was right. On the other hand, a lot of my more liberal friends who I find myself surrounded with now are just ranting about racism and how fucked up the verdict was. \n\nI totally agree. The verdict was fucked up.  I feel as if he could have been found guilty of manslaughter. 6 shots? YES. That is excessive. Four were to the hands/arm and two to the head. That, along with the witness testimonies, for the most part, saying he had surrendered and still was shot constitutes man slaughter. Due to the conflicting testimonies though, he couldn't be charged with murder.  \n\nNot to mention, this all started with Brown robbing a store.  The video of Brown stealing the cigarillos shows him aggressively shoving the convenience store clerk as he attempted to confront him.  This doesn't seem like the temperament of a guy who would just surrender when confronted by a police officer (not to imply that he didn't).  \n\nNow to the point!  I have no idea what happened on that day and how it all unfolded. I have no idea what the motivations of the police officer were.  I have no idea if Brown actually grabbed at the gun of the officer. No one does.  But all I am hearing about is how certain everyone is that is was somehow racially motivated.  \n\nI understand it is totally possible that it was racially motivated or influenced in some way.

Also it would be really awesome if a mathematician chimed in on this and gave us their perspective.\n\nAlright so here we go. Unless you believe reality is created in our minds I think we can agree that particles (such as protons or electrons) follow laws that are not contingent upon our existance. While these laws require creativity, and insight to discover they are not a product of the human mind but \"exist\" independent of us, thus making them a discovery and not an invention. I believe math is analogous. \nMy argument is pretty simple. Mathematical objects (such as numbers) obey sets of rules just like particles do. These rules are not arbitrary or the result of the human mind but \"exist\" in the same sense as the laws that govern particle physics. So why say that math is invented and not another property of reality to be discovered? CMV!"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It seems totally logical to me some people are better than others in life, and because of that, some groups of people can be better. Areas with many superior people can form a group which is superior to an area with a fewer amount of superior people. However, I don't think it's possible to measure or to know which group is the best, and also I think the best group changes from time to time to another group.  \n  \nI define \"superior\" as those people who are the 1) most intelligent, 2) most physically fit, 3) most immune to illness or disease, 4) most able to adapt to change, 5) most able to abide by a set of morals and live more or less decently, 6) most attractive person to mate with. Then I look at each race or nation (depending on how I group them), and try to rank each of them by the above criteria, and based on how I perceive the groups. I do this probably because of some inferiority complex. Then I try to estimate which group has the highest number of superior individuals. Based on criteria I'd say that Spanish people, for example, are superior to Belorussians, for example. Spain has simply given humanity much more.\n  \nLet's say nation A has men who have more superior qualities mentioned above than nation B, but fewer women of high quality. However, nation B, has many women of superior quality, and fewer men of low high quality. Thus, the optimal match would be men from nation A and women from nation B, in order to produce the best offspring. The men of B and the women of A are the losers in this scenario because they don't deserve to mate with their own group. In reality they can, but it wouldn't be optimal.  \n  \nI don't claim to know which is the superior group, but I do think individuals can be ranked, and thus groups can be ranked as well. This is reminiscent of racism and eugenics, of course. But I hate it. I hate feeling like I have to compare everyone and know that I'm on the bottom, but I can't help it. The inability to know who is best also causes me anxiety.  \n  \n\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Say it's the year 2215, robot wombs are the norm, a better chemical sterilization method is invented. There is no need for functioning testes or ovaries. \n\nEveryone knows that Geldings (neutered horses) are WAY better than Stallions. They are more hardworking, gentle, focused, docile and intelligent than stallions (Stallions only want to force their way into the mare's living space, they are crazy and sex frenzied). Same with dogs, before your neuter your dog, they are humping everything, spraying everything, and way more aggressive.\n\nI submit the same goes for humans. Men's sexual drive hinders common sense, wastes time and is utterly illogical. It ruins lives, I myself have been raped before, molested, taken advantage of by otherwise decent-ish people. Eunuchs are way more respected, way more neutral. Same goes for women, If we spay women, no periods,  no monthly mood swings, no unwanted children.\n\nMy plan would be to neuter and spay everyone after puberty.

When you want a kid, all you have to do is insert the vial of sperm into the [artificial womb machine](http://rhrealitycheck.org/files/teaser-images/2012-02-23-artificial-womb.jpg), insert the egg and you're good to go!\n\nIt would eliminate abortion, accidental pregnancies (Which is probably the biggest cause of unhappy kids, thus criminal activity.

Now, MMA is manlier than 4 of those sports listed above, and I'm not trying to deny that, but that doesn't make it a sport. Drinking boiling water and walking on fire is manlier than baseball, doesn't mean that is a sport either. \n\nStuff like NASCAR isn't a sport - there is no physical competition. I know drivers have to be in shape, but the car is the one doing the work. They're not physically running/jumping/swimming/whatever. \n\nNon-physical things like chess and e-sports should be disqualified for simply that - they're not a physical competition.

By contrast, the following European countries have officially established state religions and/or force their citizens to pay taxes to a church and/or give them explicit constitutional privileges:\n\n[source 1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_religion)\n[source 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_tax)\n\nArmenia,\nAustria,\nCroatia,\nDenmark,\nEngland,\nFinland,\nGeorgia,\nGermany,\nGreece,\nIceland,\nItaly,\nLiechtenstein,\nLuxembourg,\nMalta,\nMonaco,\nNorway,\nPoland,\nSpain,\nSweden,\nSwitzerland,\nVatican City\n\n\n**Point 2**: US Church attendance numbers are probably inflated. Around 43% of people in the US claim to attend church weekly, but [studies like this one from Columbia University]( http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/stuff_for_blog/church4.pdf) conclude that the real number is actually more like 25%. *EDIT: Based on the numbers [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_attendance#Weekly_statistics), the European countries listed report weekly attendance of roughly 22% (after adjusting for population).*\n\n**Point 3**: While a large portion of American citizens *say*, for instance, that they don\u2019t believe in evolution, their behavior implicitly contradicts that view every time they go to the doctor.\n\n**Point 4**: There is a significant amount of religious violence in Europe, and very little in the US. The conflict in Northern Ireland between Protestants and Catholics (which admittedly has a significant political dimension as well) has resulted in thousands of deaths and tens of thousands of injuries over the past 50 years. Islamic violence should also be considered here, which is much more frequent in Europe, but this gets pretty difficult when trying to separate which incidents were done *because of* Islam, and which were simply done *by* Muslims, but for unrelated reasons.\n\n**Point 5**: Islam is on the rise in Europe. The Muslim population in Europe currently represents about 6% overall (compare with 0.8% in the US), and the fervor of their religious practice is well beyond anything we see in other religious groups. ~~Some projections estimate that Europe will be 25% Muslim by 2030 while others say it won\u2019t reach that level until as late as 2100,~~Edit: Misread sources. One said \"*by* 25% by 2030\" while the other said \"to 25% by 2100\". but there is general agreement that it will constitute an increasingly influential political force over the coming years. \n\n**Point 6**: Various European countries have hate speech laws that may be well-intentioned, but in practice are frequently used to prevent people from speaking ill of Islam. By contrast, criticizing religion in the US is perfectly legal, and the Supreme Court\u2019s track record on protecting free speech suggests strongly that this isn\u2019t going to change any time soon.\n\n**Point 7**: Tension between Muslims and the rest of the population is on the rise in Europe. Some groups are actively, openly pushing to impose Sharia Law in the UK ([relevant video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC2VQjSgpso)). Statistics on how widespread this tension is are hard to come by, in part due to the chilling effects of the aforementioned hate speech laws. \n\n**Point 8**: In terms of impact, religion in the US plays a notable role in political debates surrounding abortion, some elements of science education, and biotech/genetic engineering. But the biggest anti-abortion protest ever held in the US (that I can find) had only about 650,000 people (2013 in DC), while a 2009 anti-abortion rally in Spain drew about 1.2 million. As far as science education goes, people who advocate for creationism in the US have been basically totally unsuccessful in getting creationism into classrooms, so I would argue that that constitutes near-zero impact. Progress of biotech research in both the US and Europe is somewhat stifled by cumbersome regulations, but the overwhelming bulk of that was in place before biotech became a mainstream issue, for reasons that had nothing to do with religion. Admittedly though, I don\u2019t know that much about biotech policy in Europe, so please let me know if you have a different take.\n\nSo that's about it. Let me know what you think. Apologies for inadequate proofreading! \n\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Putting a hard sound into a pronoun (Z) takes something away from the shorthand purpose of pronouns. \n\nIt is unorganized. There are a few different spellings of these pronouns, which already makes it a little confusing. Also there are more pronouns to keep track of. It makes it more difficult to talk about people because you have to consciously keep in mind what pronouns you are using. I would have a lot of trouble adapting my speech for this while trying to have a serious conversation. \n\nIt creates more reasons for people to get offended. A huge problem with the modern advocacy groups for tolerance of other genders/sexuality is that they care so much about their labels. The difference between bisexual and pansexual (My internet spellchecker doesn't think that is a word btw) continues to change each time I ask someone. Protecting their labels becomes more important than seriously discussing issues. And when people mess up or forget to use the right words to describe someone, they get reprimanded for it. I think it is silly for people to get so up in arms about something so minor. You could say its cis-gender privilege, but I wouldn't give a shit if someone referred to me as \"her\" instead of \"him.\" \n\nSo overall I feel this movement is counter productive because it takes the focus off of the issues and onto the semantics, and I feel like it is not feasible because I really can't see the majority of people accepting these gender neutral pronouns as legitimate. Isn't it a little bit silly to demand that people refer to you as Zir and get offended if they don't want to use the recently invented word? \n\n...\n\n\nUsing they also provides other benefits, such as preventing the \"special little snowflake\" image from being applicable. I now more strongly feel that Ze Zir and Zirs are the wrong choice after hearing so many people get frustrated about those words and their implications. So my view didn't exactly change in the direction I thought they would, but I feel like I have found the solution that works best. Thanks again!"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Specifically subways, buses, trains, and the Long Island Railroad, through which more than 300,000 workers commute to New York City every day.  The MTA is a public benefit corporation and is funded in part by MTA taxes which are a part of property taxes for ALL New York State residents, as well as a tax on gasoline and on fees attached to services like acquiring and renewing drivers licenses, as well as tolls on bridges and tunnels IN ADDITION to their comparatively expensive tickets.\n\nThe MTA is employed primarily by unskilled laborers with only a high school diploma, GED, or equivalent.  Yet LIRR workers make an average salary of $87,182, including overtime, according to the MTA - by far the most of workers in their field in the country.  And now, they are threatening to strike because they want a 17% raise over 6 years.  And this is the insane thing, because of how corrupt and broken modern-day unions are THE CITY IS GOING TO GIVE IT TO THEM!  They've already been offered a 17% raise over 7 years, something that NO ONE is getting in this economy, and yet they're still going to strike.  Why do you ask?  Because they want them to start paying into their benefits. Not pay for their benefits, pay INTO their benefits, just a percentage. Right now, every MTA employee and their family get full medical benefits and a pension AND THEY DON'T PAY A DIME FOR IT! And the kicker is that they would have grandfathered current employees in so they STILL wouldn't have to pay, only new hires would. \n\nI don't care what way you slice it, the degree of entitlement that the MTA has displayed is absolutely disgusting and there is no way to justify their stance that they deserve what they're demanding.\n\nChange My View.\n\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I'm really just a normal guy, most people would say 'straight-acting' although I hate what that phrase means so much lol. The way I see it, there are struggles with your **sexuality**, and then there are struggles with your **gender identity**.\n\nI don't understand why the T is in LGBT - because trans people are often outcasts like other 'non-heteros' such as myself? To the majority of transexuals, they ARE straight and their body simply doesn't reflect that! If sexuality is associated with gender identity, then it can be retroactively implied that gay men are actually fantasizing about being women on the inside - which is *ridiculously* wrong.\n\nI'm not saying that there's anything bad about trans people, that they should be excluded from things like pride or segregated in any way. I'm a huge sympathizer, in the sense that if I was THIS confused about my own sexuality before, I couldn't even begin to imagine the pain a person might feel if they were a different gender on the inside than they were on the outside. \n\nIt's in a class of its own, and little do most people realise that it's a completely different thing from transvestites/cross dressing. When uneducated people think 'gay', they jump to an image of some bulky dude dressed in drag on a cheap karaoke stage. None of this applies to sexuality in any way, and having all trans things in the same group as LGBT is causing more confusion when we should be fighting our separate battles for acceptance and equality.\n\nI'll say it again, to really *stress* this point: **Sexuality =/= Gender Identity**. Linking the two would be like putting pizza in the burger section of the menu - it just doesn't fit in with the section's whole point. You can see that I'm not trying to be mean, even if I think I sound like it right now lol. They're just two entirely different things, and there's no reason to spread confusion among an already-blurry subject."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It robs the cultural object of its symbolic power.\n2. It \"exotifies\" the culture to which the object belongs.\n3. It offends members of that culture.\n\nAnswering the first objection is trivial, in my opinion. Symbolic \"power\" is not something that a particular object can \"have.\" It is a function of how an object is understood within a given context. War bonnets that are (or were) sold at Urban Outfitters for the express purpose of being worn as fashion accessories are obviously not understood in the same way as are war bonnets that are (or were) designed to be used as profoundly significant ceremonial garments.\n\nThe second objection is much more sophisticated, and I'm admittedly much less confident in answering it. That said, I can't help but feel that *pretending* to revere an object--pretending, in other words, to be a member of the culture to which the *form* of the object originally belonged--is a much more egregious and patronizing form of \"exotification\" than wearing a war bonnet out of sincere and naive aesthetic admiration could ever be.\n\nFurthermore, I don't accept the notion that anyone's understanding of the traditional significance of the object (in this case, the war bonnet) is meaningfully impacted by the object's appearance in non-traditional contexts. I can't imagine that anyone has ever seen a 20-year-old hipster girl wearing a war bonnet at a music festival and thought to him- or herself, \"Gee, I guess it is and has always been nothing more than a fashion accessory!\"\n\nThe third objection is thornier still, but I'm willing to have a go at it. I think it's perfectly reasonable to call people out for being unnecessarily offensive when there is reason to believe that they *intend* to be offensive. When there is no apparent malicious intent on the part of the offenders, the party who is accusing them of behaving offensively ought to be expected to justify that claim--otherwise, people could go around claiming to be offended by any old thing, and we'd always be obligated to take them at their word. As far as I can tell, there is no good reason for anyone to be offended by white people wearing war bonnets at music festivals. In fact, it seems that the only people who ever really complain about it are white people who *don't* wear war bonnets at music festivals.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I believe batman is gimmicky, overhyped, unlikeable and an overall terrible superhero. Here's a summary of my views and justifications:\n\n* He claims to stand for justice, but instead exerts base revenge. If he actually cared, he would be trying hard to make sure *no other child lost their parents* like he did. Somebody like a billionaire is in every position to do exactly that. But instead of cops getting bat-armor and bat-tanks, they get a man prowling rooftops and scowling.\n\n* On that subject, I wonder how well funded the mafia in Gotham is. He never has problems financing his exuberant vigilante lifestyle. I wonder if he could have, you know, hired every thug in gotham and offered them a million each for each don captured alive?\n\n* On  the OTHER subject, I wonder just how many crimes CAN you witness from a rooftop?\n\n* Arkham is to villains like a wall is to the Koolaid man. In fact, it's debateable how many people die in Joker's escapes. In Kingdom Come, Luis Fucking Lane is one of them. If only a millionaire/genius/playboy/philantropist built, say... [an unbreachable prison of sorts?](http://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Pit-Fall.jpg) Relatively anyway. Anything better than 100% escape rate for every single criminal is an improvement. If that jail were a mailman, it would steal every letter.\n\n* As stated before, punching people after dark is a pretty awful way to go about dissuading crime. A real billionaire in a superhero universe would have funded an army of Judge Dredd-bots to patrol Gotham day and night to help cops. And to his credit, Bruce does just that in Kingdom Come... [*only after he is too old to punch people*](http://gallery.junbobkim.com/d/1315-2/10-comm-KC-Batmam-Inked.jpg). Anyone see a pattern?\n\n* I wonder how many thugs he \"interrogated\" used the fifth amendment? Just kidding, they all deserve more vitamin fist! Just like in the real world.\n\n* A rubber suit a bullet stopper ain't. The best armor we have now weighs tens of pounds and ONLY trades a hole in the chest for broken ribs. Dumb plot armor is the reason he has not had a dental appointment with a bullet.\n\n* How many underage boys died on his fucking job again? Todd, Grayson, etc.\n\n* Despite fanboys' bold boasts (that batman is undefeatable), his ass is broken by Bane in two different media, both of which could have gotten the world's greatest detective killed. But he is magically ok, and none the wiser. However, when Barbara Gordon (batgirl) [is crippled by the joker](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Y65ZgyuDiAM/TVgRJ5qErwI/AAAAAAAADLc/yuSOvHiFxzY/s1600/batman+the+killing+joke+babs+shot+-2+-+Copy.jpg), the world's greatest detective somehow forgets things like \"survivor guilt\" and just doesn't use his magic science to fix her spine. Because punching thugs is best done... alone...\n\n* He is lame: see, batnipples, batcreditcard, batplane shot down by revolver, bat-tango\n\n* He doesn't kill except when he totally does. In the movies alone, he leaves Ras to die on the train that... oh yeah, plows down a city block. I hope no one was living there.\n\nThat's all I can think of for now."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Help me sort this out, would ya?\n\n\"Animals do not know any better, so they cannot be blamed for their actions (i.e. hunting and eating other animals)\"\n\nI would think one of the premises for the existence of rehabilitation efforts in prisons, for people who once felt it was okay to injure or kill other human beings, is that criminals can effectively be taught to \"know better\". Therefore, a person who believes eating meat is immoral should feel that the same rehabilitative efforts should be made for animals who hunt other animals. As they are, it is natural for them to hunt. However, it is also natural for murderers to murder when they commit their murders. We need to change what is \"natural\" for them -- reform the animals so that they no longer feel the need to prey upon others.\n\nOf course, aside from the fact that this sounds a bit silly, I believe it is impossible to do. This would therefore lead a person who believes eating meat is immoral to the conclusion that predatory animals need to be put down, the same way that murderers who we deem cannot be rehabilitated would be issued a death sentence. Perhaps locking up carnivorous/omnivorous animals for life-term sentences could also suffice? In any case, it would seem that severe and immediate action needs to be taken.\n\nThe only way I feel you can get around this is to find a successful way of reverting wild animals' intrinsic tendencies to hunt others. But again, I do not feel like this is a realistic possibility.\n\nMaybe I am just a bit tired or out of it, but I am strangely and surprisingly convinced by this line of reasoning. Thoughts?\n\n\n\nLet's just consider Person A who believes eating meat is wrong because it takes the life of another sentient being without its consent. Animals who hunt other animals take the lives of other sentient beings without their consent. Therefore, Person A believes that these predatory animals are doing something wrong. Person A should then feel that it is right for these animals to stop doing something wrong.\n\nThis may or may not represent my stance entirely (I am not quite sure myself), but it is at least a good summary of it.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Please enlighten me as to why it's so awesome. + \n + Alright, so I'm a typical American consumer. I have a smartphone; it's not a high end one but it lets me browse the internet when I'm out and about and I have a few apps for it.\n\nI was lucky enough to get to try the Google Glass at a friend's who was part of the group who got them early. But frankly, I don't see the appeal of glass over, say, a regular smartphone like the one I have now. From what I can tell, the smartphone I have is superior to Glass in every way.\n\nPRICE\n\nFor one, Google Glass is $1,500. Compare that to just $300 for the 32GB Iphone 5s. I understand that it's brand new and the price will eventually come down, but for now, that's way too much.\n\nSPECS\n\n* 5 Megapixel camera for Glass, compared to 8 Megapixel for the Iphone.\n* 720p video camera on Glass, compared to 1080p for the Iphone.\n* 12 GB data storage capacity for Glass, compared to 16, 32, or 64 GB for the Iphone. This doesn't take cloud storage into consideration, though.\n\nCONVENIENCE\n\nOne of the big things that I hear touted about Glass is convenience over a traditional smartphone, thereby justifying the price. But let's break that down a bit.\n\n* I can't play games on Glass very easily, such as Tetris or Angry Birds that I can easily play on my phone with the touch screen. These are games that sort of require a touch screen in order to play effectively.\n* The voice feature is nice, and is very responsive, but what if I want to send a text to someone and don't want everyone around me to know what I'm saying? What if I want to visit a website but not have everyone around me know? I could use the touchpad on the side, but it's not as quick as the keypad on my phone. Even if I got used to it, it's still probably still not as quick.\n* Glass isn't a phone in and of itself, functioning more like a handsfree device. So this means that I'll have to carry around my regular phone in addition to Glass. So that means yet another device in addition to my phone that I have to charge every night and find a place to keep. But I can't keep it in my pocket like my phone, since it's glasses, and they might get crushed. I don't have a purse. And I'm certainly not wearing it clipped to my collar like a tourist because it might fall off my shirt and get smashed. I'm not wearing it on top of my head because that will look really stupid and, again, might fall off. So I either have to wear it all the time, or get some loose, big pockets to put it in.\n\nSo there goes the whole convenience argument right out the window. I'd rather just take two seconds to pull my phone out of my pocket whenever I need to use it than have the \"convenience\" of having it all right in front of my eyeballs all the time but at the cost of not having anything to do with the freaking thing when I'm not using it. Also, I'll still have to use my regular phone for many things, and still have to pull it out of my pocket when I need it anyway. \n\nWhat else has Glass promised? Browsing through Google's app store, the list of apps available doesn't seem too impressive compared with apps already available on a standard phone. \"Augmented reality?\" So, like, I'm walking down the street and see Yelp reviews for all the restaurants appear in front of my eyes? Or see driving directions pop up right in front of me?\n\nThat would be great if I ever actually went anywhere, but I've lived in the same town for years and pretty much know all the good restaurants and know my way around already. I go on a road trip maybe once a year and I just use the GPS in my car. Works great.\n\nWhat else? Night vision goggles? Uh, okay, if I ever need to see in the dark and don't happen to have a flashlight or the light on my phone, that'll be great.\n\nSo, all you glass enthusiasts out there, please tell me what the appeal is of Google Glass.\n\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

(I know this has been done before, but hear me out.) + \n + \n\n\nTo get this out of the way first, you should of course have whatever religious or non-religious/civil ceremony you want, and have it be called a legit marriage. But at the risk of sounding like a libertarian, why should the government be involved in your intimate relationship(s)?\n\nOK, the big pic: If you love someone and support them, financially and otherwise, why shouldn't you be able to say 'this is my family', without have to pay for a lawyer and going through all the legal rigamarole of 'adopting' them, getting a medical POA, etc, etc.? A marriage 'licence' costs between $35-$100 and takes about 20 minutes, and no one needs to hire a lawyer to get it done.\n\nTwo examples: When my SO's 'aunt' was ill and dying, he had to hire a lawyer to get in to see her in intensive care. She wasn't *really* an aunt, merely his deceased mother's BFF since childhood. Her parents were long dead, she had no siblings, no aunts or uncles or cousins, no living blood relatives at all (that he ever heard about in 45 years), and her marriage to some guy back in the 50's lasted about 20 minutes. He had known her as 'Aunt' Alice for his entire life. (As things turned out, he was her only beneficiary, and executor of her estate.)\n\n\nSecond example: our friend 'Chip' came for a weekend and stayed for five years. And even though we no longer live in the same state, we're still pretty much financially supporting him. (He's an amazing artist and metal smith, but in poor health and always shy of being self-supporting). He's had two heart attacks, and when he has his next one, we'll still have no standing to have any say in his medical care, or even visit him in ICU, because we aren't 'family'. But his brother, whom he's barely spoken to in a decade, does.\n\n(and also, my SO and I, who have been together for going on 39 years, have no legal standing in each others lives, except for what we've paid lawyers to do: wills, etc.)\n\nSo, why shouldn't there be a simple, cheap, legal mechanism to say \"this is my family. I am responsible for them and to them, legally and financially\"?\n\nAs a plus, it does an end run around the whole gay marriage thing, and also polygamy, etc. (but no, you still can't marry your dog.

CMV. + \n + This may not exist in some exams, but in the high school exams that I took (the IB), some students were allowed extra time for things such as: dyslexia, ADD, etc. Now before you think I'm a complete ass for essentially harming people with those conditions' future by not allowing them to perform to the \"best\" of their abilities (quotations will be explained later), here are my reasons for thinking as such:\n\nIn my view, an exam should assess a person's ability to absorb and process information in a manner suitable for the exam (for example: in math or physics exam, to be able to solve problems quickly and correctly). I think the exam should be used to distinguish between candidates for university, or a career. As such, I think that the time allocated is a rather large factor: if you have more time to absorb or process the information, you may eventually get it. But the point is to distinguish between person A and person B for a position. \n\nGiven an infinite amount of time, I would say more people would be able to get 100% on an exam, which then defeats the purpose of taking one unless your aim was just to have a confidence booster.\n\nNow, I also think that when applying (let's take the example of applying to university), these conditions should be considered: the admissions officer should know that your exam result may not be completely reflective of what you could do given a lot more time. But in the context of an exam, I don't think its about measuring your best abilities when given infinite time. The rate at which a student can absorb and process the information should be compared. This is why I put quotations around \"\"best\" of their abilities\". Of course they could do better with more time, but so can everyone (a generalization, I know: I recognize that I cannot say that all can answer every question correctly in an exam). \n\nNow the reason I care is that the exams are graded on a curve. If you compensate for a student's difficulty in reading by providing them extra time to raise their grade, it will (if enough are given more time) affect everyone's grade. It also doesn't tell the admissions officer what you can do in the time given normally in an exam, compared to another student. It defeats the purpose (in my opinion) of a standardized exam. \n\nAs well as this, I am a little skeptical as to the ability of the examiner to determine exactly how much more time would make the exam \"fair\".\n\n\nYes, it sucks that a person has this condition. Yes, I think it should be compensated for, or at least considered. No, I do not think that giving extra time in a standardized exam graded on a curve is the way to do so. I think it's like having a race between Pistorius and Bolt on the 100m, and giving Pistorius extra time. Then, taking that result into account as an average to determine who is the fastest runner. Again, I'm sorry for Pistorius to have a natural disadvantage (although I do not claim to be an expert in whether this provides disadvantages but I just compared best running times), but I don't think he should be given extra time due to his condition. \n\nTL;DR: I think extra time in an exam is like giving a legless man a head start in a race with Usain bolt until he almost beats him, then considering this a good comparison. \n\n\nPS: Let me know if my explanation isn't that good, or is missing some logical connectors. I'll try and clear it up to show exactly what I think.\n\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

There seems to be two main reasons behind this:\n\n1.) We shouldn't teach kids to behave well in order to get things.\n\n2.) Lying to them about Santa will cause trust issues later in life.\n\nNeither of these are good reasons. Legends of Santa or a Santa-like figure have existed for centuries and they haven't brought about any sort of social issues. The idea of Santa isn't teaching children that the only reason to be good is to get something, it's simply a fun idea for Christmas. Kids don't suddenly become malevolent people once they find out that Santa didn't deliver those presents. And regardless of that, in real life, doing good things *does* often result in rewards, so it's not as though the idea is false.\n\nThe, imo, more ridiculous issue is that children will fall into some sort of existential crisis when they find out Santa isn't real. I've never met anyone who has suddenly developed trust issues after they found out. Most kids seem to just get over it after like an hour. If there is a child for whom the discovery of the truth behind Santa leads to trust issues or trauma, then that child hasn't developed a healthy sense of reasoning, and if something as insignificant as Santa would be enough to push them into mental issues, then they will inevitably be faced by far worse examples of lying later on that will take a more extreme toll. It's not the idea of Santa, it's the individual and their ability to understand basic social norms and customs. \n\nAs said before, Santa is an idea that's been around for ages. It's never caused any problems before and while people have every right to not teach their kids about him, doing so in order to protect them is frankly juvenile and unnecessary. By doing so they are denying their children a fun and harmless tradition that makes Christmas an amazing time for millions of other across the world.\n\n**TL;DR** Santa is harmless and all those claiming that the idea that he's harmful are being oversensitive.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Quebec [used this](http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/bill-178/) to implement incredibly strong restrictions on speech in languages other than French.\n\nThe [*Oakes*](http://ccla.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/OJEN_Oakes.pdf) test used by Canadian courts to determine if a violation of constitutional rights under Section 1 can be permitted is incredibly weak.\n\nUnder *Oakes* the government must show that \n\n1. The infringement is rationally related to a government objective.\n\n2. The impairment of rights has to be \"as little as is reasonably possible\" (and this one keeps creeping up, used to be \"minimal impairment.\")\n\n3. There must be proportionality between the infringement and the objective.\n\nIn contrast, in the US, a restriction on free speech like in the *Whatcott* case above would be subject to [strict scrutiny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_scrutiny)  To meet the strict scrutiny standard the restriction must:\n\n1. Be justified by a compelling government interest.  The reason for the restriction has to be something the government *has* to do, not merely something they want to do.\n\n2. Be narrowly tailored to that interest.  That is, the restriction must be very specific to the exact thing the government must do.\n\n3. Be the least restrictive means possible to achieve the compelling government interest.  That means if there is any other way to accomplish the goal, it must be done before abridging the constitutional right in question.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the US took on a case of much more hateful anti-gay speech than the *Whatcott* case right around the same time.  [That opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-751.pdf) sums up the US attitude to speech pretty well:\n\nspeech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate. \n\nAll my Canadian friends think this I'm crazy for agreeing with this and wanting to allow people like the Westboro church (who were the people in that case) to speak freely.\n\nChange my view.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

CMV. + \n + There's a permeating belief that loyalty is a virtue when it comes to interpersonal relationships. Sticking by a friend no matter what, staying loyal to a lover, etc. I can agree that, when your friend or partner is going through a significant amount of adversity (such as getting fired or an illness) you're, in a sense, obligated to stay with him/her. After all, we often say that friends should be friends through thick and thin and that, when two people get married, they should stay together for better or for worse and in sickness and in health. And I do agree with that.  \n\nI also agree that loyalty shouldn't be unconditional. If a friend or partner is neglectful, abusive, or treats you badly, you're perfectly justified in ending your relationship with that person.  \n\nHowever, if you have a better option, I see nothing wrong in \"upgrading\". For example, I see nothing wrong with ending a relationship with a friend in favor of another person if he's considered to have higher social status, be it attractiveness, popularity, wealth, etc. The film *Toy Story* provides a good example of this. Initially, all of Andy's toys like Woody and hold him in high esteem, but they quickly realize that Buzz has more to offer. He has a more interesting personality, he's newer, he's got more \"features\", and so on. They eventually decide that they'd rather associate with Buzz instead of Woody. Another example could be how, in *Mean Girls*, Gretchen and Karen eventually choose to make Cady the leader of their group in place of Regina when they realize that Cady has more to offer in terms of social status than Regina. No one faults Karen, Gretchen, or the rest of Andy's toys for upgrading. Similarly, no one would fault you for, say, upgrading to a better car or a nicer apartment.  \n\nThe same applies to romantic relationships, including marriages. Yes, provided you have no better alternatives and you're getting everything you want out of the relationship and nothing you don't want (such as abuse or mistreatment), one could say you're obligated to stay in that relationship. But if you have an opportunity to upgrade, I see nothing wrong in doing so.  \n\nFor example, if I was married and my wife met someone wealthier or better looking than me, I think my wife would be perfectly justified in ending her relationship with me to pursue a relationship with that new person. In fact, I'd want her to do so. If I truly loved her, I'd want her to have the best. I wouldn't want to hold her back. Similarly, I don't think I'd be in the wrong for ending my marriage to her and pursuing a relationship with a wealthier or more beautiful woman, and I'd expect her to encourage me to pursue a better partner.  \n\nSimilarly, and this may seem a bit trivial, but I don't see what's wrong in ending your association with and support for a given sports team in favor of a more successful one. People want to associate with the best, and if their current teams can't provide that with them, it's only rational for them to change loyalties.\n\ntl;dr: I don't think ending a relationship (platonic or romantic) in order to create a relationship with a better partner (better meaning funnier, better looking, wealthier, etc.) is wrong.  \n\nCMV."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

CMV + \n + Let us define these concepts first:\n\n**Patriarchy:** From feminist theory, the *a priori* truth that society is immediately geared to favor male *(cis-gendered(?))* people, male-like qualities and male role models to the derision of women, feminine traits and role-models in women and everything else in between. \n\n**Oligrachy:** The *a priori* turth stating society is immediately geared to favor wealth and the wealthy, venerates money and the accumulation of it and puts wealthy people in a pedestal to revered and admired.\n\nColorary:\n\nWhile I have many qualms with contemporary feminism (i.e. it's a movement that preaches gender equality and freedom of expression but acts to tarnish those same principles when met with dissenting opinions), I think some of the ideas it purports have a basis in fact (i.e. the right for a woman to choose over her own body).\n\n\nThat being said, I think the concept of *patriarchy* as the great boogeyman and the reason for all society's ills is misguided, ham-handed and short-sighted. It fails to represent societies around the world in a fair manner over time, assumes men are always favored over women in all circumstances and doesn't acknowledge healthy relationships between a man and a woman exist in many different hues and styles. I also believe the concept destroys history, culture and any kind of context in an effort to view everything with a short-sighted lens.\n\nView:\n\nI think that patriarchy is dwarfed by oligarchy, defined above. Wealth is held by any person at any given point of time, and it is the wealthy who have the power to oppress those who don't have as much wealth. While this is a point counteracted with the argument that most CEOs in the western world are men, this is also short-sighted: It's not hard to see wealth doesn't have a prejudice towards women. Positions of power held by women and men have alike have been based around the accumulation of wealth and social clout. Whenever a woman came from a wealthy family or built her own wealth, power never escaped them because they were female. If we lived in a purely patriarchal society, the smashing success of Oprah Winfrey, Anna Maria Escobedo or Sonia Sotomayor wouldn't be possible. These are all women who built their own wealth, and I'd argue they jumped through as many hoops and obstacles as man in a similar or even identical situation. Looking back on history, wealthy women had a lot more privileges than men and women in lower classes of society. Even though Marie Antoinette's \"Let them eat cake.\" is a fake quote, it speaks to the vision of the French people of their higher classes as privileged people, disenfranchised from their woes. They even went so far as to execute her, not because she was a mother or a woman, but because she represented the crown they hated. \n\nIn my opinion, men aren't favored over women. Society simply favors the wealthy, whoever these people may be. As as society, we allow these people to be beacon and a finish line, a set of desirable traits that sets those who have far above those who haven't. These same people are the ones who get to make our laws (the 2013 US government shutdown), dictate our economy (AIG and the 2008 financial meltdown) and get to decide who thinks what (oligopoly of media). \n\nThe poor man will never be favoured over the rich woman. \n\nI want this view to be challenged.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In this situation, I\u2019m only referring to libertarians who adhere to the principles of self-ownership and non-aggression. Google defines feminism as: the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men.\n\n\nWhile I don\u2019t know what all feminists believe, the common theme I\u2019ve noticed is:\n\n* A belief that you own your own body and know best how to care for it\n\n* A belief that the government shouldn\u2019t tell women what to do with their body\n\n* A belief that interactions should be consensual and voluntary\n\n* A belief that voluntary organization can be used to subvert hierarchies of power\n\n\nI believe that IF feminists are willing to uphold these notions as first-principles, and support them to their logical extent, feminists are essentially advocating for the basic libertarian ideals. \n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

You are providing value to the user, so why wouldn't you get paid for it?\n\nNot only that, but you are potentially ruining somebody else's business by developing a open source alternative, which is to say, you're kind of disrespecting the effort and work they've put on the product they're trying to sell by not even competing for the money. \n\nAlso, can you imagine if everyone went open source? There would be no money on software anymore, only infrastructure. Videogames, for example, wouldn't be what they are today.

I just found this sub-reddit tonight as I was thinking about a lot of opinion topics so I thought it would be a good time to express this opinion of mine. Disclaimer: I'm neither a vegan nor a vegetarian.\n\nI understand that many vegetarians abstain from meat because they feel morally guilty or they feel that it is wrong to kill animals for food. I suppose that some vegetarians may just not want to take part in eating meat themselves and don't really care about the bigger picture but that seems like a shallow and pointless reason to be a vegetarian to me. While meat-eaters don't actively kill the animals themselves by eating them, they support the slaughterhouses and farms that do kill the animals for food production by continuing to consume meat. If meat is demanded it will be supplied, and vegetarians aim to reduce the demand. This to me seems like a much more legitimate purpose and reasoning for being vegetarian. This same philosophy compels people to vote in democratic governments. Even if they are only one person, it takes many individuals to come together to elect representatives. This is the most valid argument that I can think of in favor of moral vegetarianism.\n\nThis philosophy is all fine and good but vegetarians alone will not and cannot fulfill this goal by virtue of not being vegans. As long as dairy products and eggs are consumed, there is still a need for dairy cows and egg-laying chickens. When the cows no longer produce milk and the chickens no longer lay eggs what do you think happens to them? Generally they are turned into meat for human consumption. Vegetarians drink milk and eat cheese that comes from cows that get slaughtered. The only way to lessen meat production is to reduce the number of people with any kind of need or want for animal products. Maybe I'm wrong about what vegetarians aim to accomplish exactly. Any ideas?"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

CMV + \n + I am a female who has a guilty pleasure of fanfiction. However, it is also something I have spent a lot of my life denying and trying to change. As a result, it is something I similarly judge other females for (and, I imagine, I would also judge males for, although I have not encountered that particular situation). For example, I have seen a car with the bumper sticker \"Got yaoi?\" on it, and I totally judged the girl...but also felt kind of jealous.\n\nI find the reading of typical romance novels/fanfiction shameful, as it seems to me to be a rejection of reality/what the author intended of a particular work (when it deviates from the canon laid out by said work). In addition, I also find it shameful to find a kind of...comfort from them, as I tend to do.\n\nI am unsure of the reasons why I react in the particular way I do to fanfiction. Relevant experience and stories are welcome. Thank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is shame from enjoying something that is poorly written, as it reflects a lack of taste on the reader's part. \n\n\nThere is shame in being associated with teenage girls. Don't lie. There is.\n\n\nI believe this derives from the few friend I've had in the past that openly enjoyed yaoi. At the time, it seemed to consume every aspect of their life. I guess at the time, I was a teenage girl though, so refer back to the previous point.\n\n\nThere is a sense of shame to be found in getting too involved in immaterial (irrelevant? ultimately will never affect you?) things. A similar example I can think of is a person getting overly happy/upset over their &lt;sport&gt; team winning or losing.\n\n\nComfort should come from a solid place. A place of confidence knowing I am a capable person. A place of confidence knowing I am a likable person worth loving and having friends. \n\nOn deviation from a canon being shameful:\n\n\nOtherwise...thank you for all of your replies.

Lastly, I have nothing wrong with nudity and am in fact a fan of nudity, I just don't understand exposing yourself to the entirety of the internet on a whim.\n\nWhenever I see anyone, male or female, posting nude pictures on the internet, I immediately assume that they are somehow seeking attention.  Of course, that's the point, but I think that it must stem from some underlying need to get attention that they must either be lacking in some other part of their life, or simply need because that's their personality and that they feed off of attention.  \n\nSpecifically in the case with women, many of my female friends, including my girlfriend (hence the throwaway) , have posted nudes and any time I ask them why, they somehow defend it with \"it makes me feel good.\"  Of course, I ask them why it makes them feel good and most either don't have an answer or somehow deay it makes them feel empowered as a woman who is proud of her body.  I don't understand how posting images of yourself naked, often with the understanding that others will masturbate to you (/r/gonewild for example) is not empowering but instead a form of whoring yourself out in a sense.  \n\nSo reddit, why do people post nudes?

CMV + \n + My viewpoint is based upon what I believe to be three fundamental truths about Cupcakes and Muffins:\n\n1.  There is a distinc difference between a Cupcake and Muffin.\n\n2.  Muffins are seen in our culture as being the healthier option of the two.  Just the word itself carries with it a suggestion of sorts that the confection is guaranteed to be at least moderately good for you.\n\n3.  Cupcakes are seen in our culture as being the less healthy option of the two.  Just the word itself carries with it a suggestion of sorts that the confection you will be eating is guaranteed to be pretty bad for you.\n\nWith this in mind, I think it's incredibly irresponsible and dishonest for coffee shops and bakeries to market their cupcakes as muffins.  Obviously people should be responsible for what they put into their own bodies, and should be more informed about what it is exactly that they're eating, but because of this constant cupcake / muffin mismarketting debaccle I feel western culture as a whole has been lead to believe -- erroneously of course -- that muffins will have less impact on their well-being than cupcakes, this is why muffins are so widely accepted as breakfast food, and not cupcakes when in reality the two couldnt be more similar.\n\n**The Differences**\n\nBecause of this cultural misinformation, I'm sure many people are confused as to the difference between the cupcake and the muffin.  \n\nMuffins, historically, started off as savoury, wheaty quick breads that were often eaten as breakfast, or brunch foods.  They are created with the dry, and wet ingredients mixed seperatly, and then combined before baking.  The muffin started as a rural food, as most of the ingredients were grown by, and available to farmers / the lower class.\n\nCupcakes date back to around the early 19th century, and were simply just an easier, more convenient way for the upper class to enjoy cake.  Cupcakes are created using the \"creaming\" method in baking, and are literally just small sweet, sugary cakes.  \n\nThe greatest distinction between the two is the fact that one is cake, and the other is a bread which typically uses wheat, with yeast to rise.\n\nMy issue with this whole thing is that it's more or less just a personal annoyance that the word Muffin has come to mean \"Cupcake that we don't want you to think of as a cupcake\" in North America.

Laypeople underestimate the required rigor involved in making scientific judgments (given simplified nature of the  taught simulations)\n2.  Laypeople overestimate their own capacity to make critical judgments on scientific topics they have little experience with.\n3.  Laypeople routinely make judgments on scientific and health matters that they don't have the experience to make on their own.\n\nThe real-world consequences:\n\n1. Refusal of vaccines by parents of young children resulting in new outbreaks of preventable diseases (e.g. measles, pertussis)\n2. Popularity boom of alternative and do-it-yourself medicine (much of which is disturbingly unregulated)\n3. Scientific \"controversies\" that largely exist only in the public sphere - i.e. Evolution\n\nI believe these issues would be mitigated if we went back to more traditional and instructive learning. I feel that the degree of hands-on learning taught in schools, museums, and television is more harmful than productive at this time. "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

No incumbents whatsoever, unless anyone can think of any reasonable exceptions. Perhaps try this only for the House, since I'm not sure how you would go about doing it for the Senate with their staggered election cycles (though I'm sure a program could be devised).\n\nThen, after one or two terms, allow old incumbents to run again. This could be more than one or two terms; the idea is to allow at least enough time for the effects of an all-freshman Congress to develop its own culture and start making things happen unique to that Congress.\n\nThe reason I currently believe this would be successful is I sense that Congress is over-burdened by the weight of tradition and even distracted by it. It's likely to me there are plenty of visionary freshmen, and even visionary candidates, with excellent ideas to help ease gridlock and make efficient progress again, but under the weight of the current institution I propose that it's nearly impossible for this to happen.\n\nAdditionally, I do not see any significant drawbacks to this, as a one-time experiment. If it fails, if it's useless, the worst I could see happening is, after the no re-election rule expires, everything returning to normal. Perhaps there could even be a provision in the law which allows for an emergency return of control to the previous Congress in the case of absolute chaos, though I sincerely doubt this would be the case.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It's become a joke that when an adult becomes disillusioned by something, they compare it to when they \"first learned Santa wasn't real.\" And it may be a joke, but it's only funny because there is truth in it. There is real disillusionment in that moment when you first learn that Santa's not real, and there's a real feeling that you've been lied to, because - well - you have been lied to all your life by the very people you should trust the most. The only thing it teaches children is that it's ok to lie, your parents have lied to you all your life, and even society itself will go to great lengths to trick you. Find me one kid who wasn't crushed when they learned Santa wasn't real. \n\nNow I'm not saying that a kid's going to need to go into therapy over it or anything, and there are much worse things out there, but there is really no benefit to this lie at all. We might lie to our kids about other things - like when they first learn about death, you might tell them, \"No, I'm not going to die for a long, long time,\" even though that's obviously something nobody knows. But there's a very useful benefit to that lie. It calms your child's fears about death. They could develop all kinds of fears and neuroses if you didn't find a way to calm them, so it makes sense. The lie about Santa offers nothing.\n\nSome people will say that it helps foster their imagination, but I would say that, yes, stories like this and other fairy tales do help to foster a kid's imagination, but why do we need to go to such great lengths to convince our kids that he's real? We don't do this with other stories. We don't try to tell our kids that Hansel and Gretel were real kids, or that Spiderman exists, or that Daniel Radcliff really is a wizard. In fact, we often take the time to explain to them that Daniel Radcliff's just an actor, and Harry Potter can't really cast those spells, and all of that stuff is just movie magic. So why don't we do the same with Santa? We could still tell them the story, but why lie to them about it being real?"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Not actual serious racist beliefs or acts. But instead the jokes we're uncovering people telling each other, trying to prevent people form using the 'n word', trying to uncover those villainous, secret racists at every turn if they date to say one thing that sound remotely insensitive, etc. This is not a good thing, in fact I think it's quite bad. Trying to weed out and crucify not just what people do, but what people think, actually gets a little Orwellian. \n\nI think most of what you see today is not people who rationally believe one race is inferior, but moreso people who are just angry, pissed off people, and hatred fills a vacuum. Or perhaps people who don't rationally believe one race is inferior, but still engage in it because it provides them some emotional satisfaction. A lot of it also seems to be an abstract hatred, rather than a hatred of people they personally have connected with in some way.\n\nIt's also true that when you hate someone, you hate everything about them. Even the most innocuous acts become part of your hate: \"Look at the way she got up and walked to the bathroom. What a bitch.\" I've often argued that many conservatives don't hate Obama *because* he is black, but simply hate the opposition so much that they hate everything about them, including his blackness. As someone who dabbled in conservative/Libertarian thinking, to the point where intellectual opposition mixed with passion turned to anger toward those opposed, I started to realize the line between, \"I disagree with the views of the party which is supported by minorities,\" to, \"Damn minorities are ruining everything!\" is shorter than one likes to think. \n\nIf I still have a real dislike, it's not for a skin color, it's for social justice warriors and do-gooddery. I see it as so self-righteous, and oppressive in it's own way. Nothing makes me want to shout \"Ni@@er!\" (I think it's sad that I can't even write the damn word without expecting my post won't be excepted in *a debate about the word*!) more than being told I'm never, ever allowed to use that word by someone else. It's strikes a core nerve in me to go, \"Oh yeah? Who are you to tell me what is right to say or do?\"\n\nAnd I have used that word, let's talk about some context: In my car. I dunno about you, but there are few base joys they lift you from a bad day than giving yourself an excuse to feel superior to another driver. Most people wouldn't label someone a terrible person for grumbling about a driver that cut them off in traffic. That person may not be any worse a driver than you on whole, but for now, they're just the asshole who cut you off. In the comfort of my own car, I'm free. I can say anything I want to say, and it's liberating. And the more base reason I have for that pleasurable chemical release the coincides with imagining myself feeling superior to another human being for that short time, the better. The easiest are sex, race, and age. I often like to string expletives together. \"Bitch ass negro,\" is a good one (I don't even know if the driver is black or female, it just feels good). \n\nI also often love to play off the fact that \"gay\" or \"faggot\" has developed so interestingly in our society. To me and Eminem, those words don't actually apply to gay people, although I think it's [Louis C.K.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fcja4WFFzDw) who pretty much nailed the dichotomy (Chris Rock has a similar line). I often like to even go the other way with it, so if someone is, as Louie says, acting 'like a faggot,' say something like, \"I found that action to be rather homosexual in nature.\" Or at least, I'd like to be able to say that more readily, if I didn't have to worry about the political correctness police, who have successfully invaded society to the extent that you actually have to worry about your job and life if you said that, jumping on me for it. That is *not* a good thing.\n\nThe recent Sigma Alpha Epsion frat video with the racist chant that's been going around makes me think too. I think we should be easier on them. Yes, there were being assholes, but they were being assholes as a fun thing in their own private setting. If every inappropriate and 'I'm going to hell for this' joke my friends and I have told in the comfort of our own homes were recorded for others to see, it would be a treasure trove. \n\nAlso, I dunno if anyone else remembers being a teenage boy like I do, but teenage boys talk shit to make themselves seem cooler and tougher. I remember when I was in Jr High and the OJ Simpson case was big news, and exchange between two friends went something like this: \"Actually, I thought Nicole Brown was pretty cute.\" \"Yeah, but she did marry a *negro*\" \"Yeah, she deserved to die just for that.\" - pretty damning, huh? I can just see that as a huge news story if someone today caught it on video. But I feel like it would create a cognitive dissonance in many who don't get it that those same guys, when faced with, say, a black guy on the street who looked like he was hurt, wouldn't hesitate to be decent human beings and help, but it's true. If you can't figure out how that is possible, then you're missing part of how human beings interact. \n\nI feel the same way about a lot of the emails that have been 'exposed', like ones talking about what movie Obama would like. I see it as two people making joking with each other. Bottom line, I think if we're really going to live in a society where everything we say and do is exposed for others to scrutinize, we have to gain some better understanding or how people behave, and become more, not less, tolerant of such 'racism'."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I know many other states have similar laws.  \n\nAfter living in a country where I can buy booze 24/7 it seems extremely conservative and antiquated to prohibited the hours where an adult can buy alcohol.  I am adult and can make my own choices.  It is not up to the state to police my purchase of a legal substance because they disapprove of the time of day I buy it.  Furthermore, this law is extremely odious to people who don't work traditional 9-5 hours.  What if you get of work at 2am and want a drink - too bad I guess, you should have gotten a 'correct' job that works normal hours.  \n\nHere are some objections I've heard to changing this law\n\n- **It will increase crime**\n\nI'm not sure this is true.  I live in Japan where you can buy alcohol 24/7 and the crime rate is next to nothing.  Furthermore I'd argue that when all the bars close at the same time and masses of drunk people are released into the streets at the same time it increases the amount of fights and crimes.  I've certainly seen it anecdotally.  \n\nLet's assume it is true though.  So?  It's not up to the state to police someone from buying a legal substance because of what they 'might' do.  When they commit a crime, then arrest them.  There are all sorts of potential laws that could prevent crime, for example a curfew for adults from 10pm to 5am.  But these kind of laws that severely curtail liberty for the possibility of safety are un-American.  \n\n- **It will increase drunk driving**\n\nI've never owned a car and lived within a 5 minute walk of a liquor store for my entire life.  Why should I be subject to these laws?\n\n- **People who buy alcohol at those hours never have good reasons**\n\nIt is not up to the government to police my reasons.  Morality is for the individual to decide, not the state.  \n\n- **It will force workers who work in bars and liquor stores to work way longer hours**\n\nSlavery was ended in 1865.  Employment is voluntary.  If this is really a concern than either better enforce current labor laws or make stronger ones.  But I don't see why my liberty has to be curtailed.  \n\nAnyway please CMV"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

CMV + \n + This kind of started off as an argument with my roommates and I, however I recently noticed on thread here on Reddit (the one on what people 100 years from now will find barbaric that we find acceptable now) that my opinion seems to be the unpopular one on the matter.\n\nI live in Toronto, which for all intents and purposes is a fairly large, densely populated city (~3 million in the city proper), and so yes I deal with congestion, gridlock, and generally stupid drivers on a regular basis. Nevertheless I still love driving. Part of the reason is because of how inefficient our public transit system is one could still get around the city in the same amount of time as it would to drive, even in rush-hour traffic. Sure parking might be an expensive inconvenience from time to time, but I like many people drive not just as a mode of transportation, but because its actually an enjoyable activity for me.\n\nI understand that self-driving cars *could* eliminate gridlock and save \"countless\" lives by removing the human error that comes with driving (I emphasize the could because from what I know there aren't any actual statistics or studies that I am aware of that can support this). That said, I think people forget that even extremely simple technology does fail from time to time. If anything were to go wrong in a self-driving car, how would someone be able to intervene? I mean if we were introduced to self-driving cars tomorrow, I wouldn't be as concerned because most people would know how to control the vehicle. But if years from now, when people have become accustomed to self-driving cars, would they know how to control the car if the self-driving mechanism fail, or would it be just a matter of placing complete faith in a computer technology created by the same humans who's error we're trying to avoid?\n\nI personally think it would also take what enjoyment there is in driving away from the experience. As mentioned, if I wanted a mode of transportation where I didn't have to do anything (at all) I would just take public transit. I enjoy driving because I can control both my speed and my route (if I want to go out of my way to take a more scenic route home, I have the option), all in the comfort of a private vehicle with my own music playing and my own company. Although a self-driving car wouldn't affect the latter, the former (which is the reason why I drive rather than ask others for rides) would be compromised. \n\nThere's an entire culture and community around driving that revolves around making improvements to what you drive and I can't help but feel that'd completely disappear with self-driving cars. I wouldn't be opposed to people buying self-driving cars if that's truly what they want (no different that people who chose to buy cars with automatic transmissions) or even if there were the option to turn on a self-driving mode (which I'll admit would be nice in bumper-to-bumper traffic where you're really not even driving anyways), but my view is exactly that to have the **option**. So Reddit, I apologize for my long-winded post but I look forward to you changing my view so that I might be more open to the idea of this technology that so many people are sure might become the new norm !"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I'd like to feel comfortable saying any word I don't mean hatefully without my intentions being doubted, but my purpose here is to have the view that there *ought* to be nothing wrong with me saying it challenged. ***Ninja Edit*** \n\nI was raised in a not particularly diverse part of America and a decent chunk of my school career was spent in classes or watching presentations or badly acted videos about how judging people based on their skin color was wrong and that labeling people based on their skin color was wrong etc. I and my white classmates and my white teachers were all pretty much on the same page about the \"n-word\" being bad and mean. \n\nNow as I'm getting older and finding myself really enjoying hip hop in general, I'm discovering that a (to me) surprising portion of the population seems to think they've taken the word back and made it their own. Which would be great if it were true because then a group of people would have been able to take a label of disempowerment, and remove the hate from it; appropriate it into something positive and wear it as a badge of honor and solidarity. And if you glanced at hip hop music out of context, you might even think they succeeded.\n\nIn that context it draws similarities to the word \"nerd\" and \"geek\" where the people labeled that way decided that what made them that way was something to be proud of, not ashamed. Obviously when you're talking about hobbies vs. race it's not a perfect example and I'm by no means trying to trivialize the oppression that did happen. I'm no stranger to the historical context of the word and why any time it comes out of a white person's mouth, it seems justifiable to be suspect of his or her intentions - but it seems to me that if the word had actually been taken back, then anyone should be able to use it in it's properly reformed context regardless of their skin color.\n\nI mean, a desk is a desk no matter who says \"desk.\"\nAnd while the people I can call \"friends\" might be different from the people you can call \"friends,\" it doesn't suddenly change its meaning -let alone become a slur of derision when someone else says it.\nSo why for a very specific group of Americans is \"my nigga\" a compliment and coming from quite literally anyone else in any other context besides academia, a racial slur?\n\nI feel like cultural appropriation is tied into this topic too, but I can't really articulate how.\n\nTLDR: If Childish Gambino, Jay Z, Lil Wayne, and Kanye West can use \"nigga\" positively, why can't Eminem if his intentions are good and the context is positive? Why does the fact that he's white mean that he can only be using the word in a hateful manner?\n\nWhen I think about it like that, it strikes me as actually pretty racist."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I'm just saying, for example, at my high school, there are multiple clubs for multiple races: the black club, the Chinese club, the Middle East club, the Hispanic club, the Russian club, the Brazilian club, the Filipino club, you name it, we have it. Except the white club.\n\nI'm not a whiner; I really don't care if there's a white club or not. If there was I probably wouldn't even join it. What irritates me is this stigma against white people, by other races and EVEN BY WHITE PEOPLE THEMSELVES (aka 'white guilt'). Yes, I understand- extremist groups have a history of making whites look bad, and white people have been responsible for some pretty terrible things in the world. But guess what? It's 2013, people. Race wars are essentially nonexistent. I am not forgiving the past in any way, but what I *am* saying is that whites today had no control over those things and shouldn't be marginalized for them.\n\nIf every other race can have a club, why can't the white people? And I'm not saying it's a \"whites only\" club, I'm not an idiot. Besides, for example, white people can be members of the black club. There is no racial requirement for participation. It is just a hub in which black culture is celebrated and discussed.

The reality is that in this modern world, racism scarcely shows its ugly face, especially among civilized people.

Also, this submission will mainly pertain to the online game League of Legends (henceforth LoL), both because it's what I mostly play and due to the fact that it is a good example of the phenomenon I am about to elaborate upon.\n\nAlso, if you are not familiar with the game please allow me to provide some insight in to the current state of the chat system and player's respective behavior to such. Nearly every game someone (or multiple people) are reported for either verbal abuse or negative attitude, for reasons ranging from saying \"gg\" (good game) slightly before the game ends to people filling chat the entire game with racist accusations in all caps. The community is so report-happy and self-righteous that many simply ignore everyone at the start of the game or hide chat, due to the perceived toxicity of all players or own fear of succumbing to inclinations to chat and being reported thereafter. I'm not happy with this current consensus and feel a dramatic shift of opinion is needed.\n\nFirst, allow me to point out the hypocrisy the LoL community currently exhibits. People love watching other people get trash talked, but get offended when it is directed towards them. I will provide some examples. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYI0Tf7-Vvo), Dyrus (a professional celebrity in the community paid and endorsed by Riot) recently called a majority of the other NA teams non-existent. Here is a [compilation of trash talking excerpts from LoL interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxS76Dk3Rk4). Riot Games (producer of LoL) actively encourages trash talking between teams and players to build up hype (and the community responds positively), but as soon as a player practices similar behavior in a game, he or she can be banned. Should this example not convince you, allow me to point to the player meatwadsprite, commonly known as Dunkey to the community. In a majority of his videos he talks a lot of trash in all chat and he is by far the most popular content producer for the game (and likewise supported by Riot). People find this type of behavior hilarious to watch, but as soon as such harmless commentary is inflicted upon them, the perpetrator deserves some sort of suspension.\n\nHeroes of Newerth (HoN) was (is) a very similar games to LoL. Both were multiplayer battle arenas and were based off the same game (Defense of the Ancients). However, in HoN, players were rarely reported and banned less often than that. The community in that game is what I envision for LoL, where players were unfiltered and free to express themselves. Celebrities in the game such as KingRaven, Daggius, and MoonMeander were most popular, for they were the most entertaining, and players were often coming up with and one-upping their personalities displayed on stream and in videos. These glory days of HoN still bring me nostalgia as the community and my friends alike coordinated in [creating chat macros](http://forums.heroesofnewerth.com/showthread.php?382071-Chat-macro-compilation), ridiculous all chat [messages to disorient the enemy](http://www.dotallyrad.com/2011/10/drd-insult-generator-goes-live-to-help-you-post-big-comments/), while the game developer (S2) created in-game taunts for heroes for purchase [that embarrassed your enemy on successful execution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VC4j4U7K6mc).\n\nI believe these players should get over themselves and embrace the trash talk. It relieves stress, is a fun outlet, and the creativity can often be hilarious. Players seem to prefer a robotic version of the game, where the only allowed chat is as a \"gg\" when the game is over and communicating strategy. A majority of people play the game for two reasons: fun and competition. Both aspects are enhanced through trash talk, as the creativity often produces great laughter while the ladder is augmented by the fact that trash talking raises the stakes of the game, as neither side wishes to lose face."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

This man tortured and raped an 18 year-old girl, then made her lure one of her friends into the house where she was being held. \n\n[He then tied up and beat 19 year-old Stephanie Neiman](http://www.newson6.com/story/25392928/remembering-stephanie-neiman-oklahoma-murder-victims-tragic-story), made her kneel, shot her with a shotgun (which jammed initially, and had to be cleaned out so that they could shoot her again). While Stephanie was screaming, writhing in pain, he made her watch as he and his accomplices dug her grave. He then threw her in, still breathing, and buried her alive.\n\nStephanie Neiman (nor any other murder victim), received the benefit of due process-- something that Mr. Lockett availed himself of. She got no trial, no advocate to argue on her behalf. There was no deliberation by a jury of her peers, and no judge, after carefully weighing the facts, in accordance with state law, passed sentence. She was not given multiple chances to appeal over the course of 15 years, as Mr. Lockett was, nor was she offered a last meal, and the chance to make a final statement. \n\nThe way Stephanie Neiman died was, by any standard, \"Cruel and Unusual\", the fact that it took a little bit longer for her murderer to be \"put to sleep\", is neither \"*[gruesome](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/30/lethal-injection-leads-to-the-most-botched-executions.html)*\" nor \"*heinous*\". \n\nChange my view. \n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I mean, what harm is there in that? The worst that could happen is that she wouldn't feel the same way. Or so I thought. He ended up telling her and she didn't feel the same way at all. He a was a little disappointed but he felt better because he finally got it off his chest. Fast forward a few weeks, I walk into the break room to microwave something and that girl is sitting there with some of her friends. Low and behold they are talking about how my friend asked her out. I was almost sick to my stomach when i heard how they were describing it. She was trying to make it seem like he was some sort of stalker rapist. I witnessed the event and can certainly claim that nothing remotely like that happened. Why would someone get so offended by the simple fact that a person was attracted to them? It is pretty pathetic. He never even really spoke to her after he had asked her out and never maid any indication that he was holding on to the hope of getting her.

It is becoming an increasingly common cause of traffic collisions, which are often fatal. Additionally, the most inexperienced drivers (young drivers) are also the population more likely to engage in texting while driving. To curb this, I feel like something more significant than a ticket should be appropriate. Driving is a privilege, and abusing it while putting other people's lives at risk means a person should lose that privilege. I feel like this would have a huge impact on new drivers (who may identify a license as a source of freedom) as well as older drivers (who might need to drive to commute to work). It may seem harsh for people trying to make a living, but it's not something impossible to do. Many people use public transport without issue, so it's not exactly a crippling blow.  \n\nPosts to social media should be allowed as evidence. I'm not suggesting that companies be required to monitor and report, but if a post is seen by a law enforcement official then there is no question of guilt. If posting something publicly is protected by free speech, then it must be treated as such. Freely admitting to breaking a law is not protected by any sort of fifth amendment right, and if publicly available it cannot be protected as something expected to remain private. \n\nA 1-month suspension with increasing penalties for repeat offenses seems a good way to. \n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I disagree with this definition because it excludes men who are raped by being forced to penetrate someone's mouth, vagina, or anus, which is currently categorized as sexual assault. In a NYTimes article by describing society's blind spot towards male rape victims, 1/21 men have been (or attempted to be) made to penetrate in non-consensual sex or receive oral sex, but are not considered rape victims under the current definition.\n\nLegally, men who are attacked this way cannot seek justice as a rape victim, but rather as a sexual assault victim, which may result in lower sentences for the attacker. Men made to penetrate may not be able to access recovery resources restricted to rape victims. Lastly, this archaic definition may perpetuate equally archaic views on male rape, such as \"men cannot be raped by women\" or \"an erection means consent,\" even though erections can be an involuntary response. \n\n**Tl;dr** Women can force men to have nonconsensual sex through \"forced enveloping,\" and this should be covered under the definition of rape. People who prefer the current definition, what is your thought process? \n\nNote: The current definition also excludes a variety of non-penetrative sex, but this blindspot affects the most people, so I'm curious to see people's view about this first.

It represents a singularity event whereby the amount of information to a single person is greater than could be consumed in whole lifetimes and a platform for an open exchange of information that is unrivaled in the history of humanity.\n\nAnything in the world you can think to want to learn, you can through the internet. Culture from any time and place, as well as the tools to participate and create modern culture on your own, can be found online.

We should protect the greatest asset to human learning and communication that ever was in the same way we protect school as a right.\n\nTo the inevitable [Avenue Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTJvdGcb7Fs) fans, only about [4-5%](http://www.forbes.com/sites/julieruvolo/2011/09/07/how-much-of-the-internet-is-actually-for-porn/) of the internet is for porn.

Just because cannabis is potentially no more dangerous than other drugs does not mean it should be freely available. If anything, someone admitting that alcohol/tobacco are dangerous should be seeking to limit availability/legality of those drugs, not adding new ones to the mix.\n\nI hold this view because the legalisation of cannabis will add to the global health burden, and treatment of diseases associated with cannabis use will divert funds away from other areas.

In a nutshell, this is how the governmental systems transformed from monarchies of the past, to today's democracies.   \n  \nHowever, today's 'representative democracy' governmental style, which is predominant in the western world, is overdue. Distance has died: there is no more need to travel few days from your town to the capital in order to get informed or vote. Everything is live, everything is current. One does not need a representative to supposedly act in his behalf.  \n  \nWe still need representatives at the moment as people cannot run their country all day long from their cell phones. But we should diminish the 4 years voting system that ensure the power stays in the hand of the ruling bunch. Our representative should work for us, give us daily updates, be accountable for their actions and in case there is a majority of voters who are not happy about a representative performance, they could fire him. Plain and simple. The people are the boss who hire the representatives to run their precious country.

John Oliver did [a rant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kEpZWGgJks&amp;list=PLmKbqjSZR8TZa7wyVoVq2XMHxxWREyiFc) about it last week, but I want to emphasize that my view is not based on a John Oliver rant.\n\nProblems with civil forfeiture\n\n* It is essentially a criminal punishment without the protections of criminal procedure.\n\nCivil forfeiture takes property from someone based on the accusation of a crime.  It is essentially a fine, and to assess a fine, the government needs to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, with the presumption of innocence on the part of the accused, and with all the other good stuff we guarantee in criminal procedure (right to remain silent, right to an attorney, right to call witnesses, right to confront one's accuser, etc.).   As an example of the abuses of process, in Philadelphia, prosecutors seize people out of their homes, and won't agree to let them back in unless they waive innocent owner defenses. \n\n* Civil forfeiture creates terrible incentives for police.\n\nCivil forfeiture means that police will be more interested in going after money in many cases than going after crime.  Often, they will go after money in lieu of going after crime.  Many people will have their assets seized without being charged with a crime, which seems perverse.  Further, police departments and DA's offices get to keep the proceeds of the funds they seize.  This means they have a huge incentive to seize aggressively and often illegally.  It would be wildly unconstitutional to pay police officers per arrest.  But we essentially do that with forfeiture funds going to police department budgets, or police pension funds.  Depositing the forfeiture proceeds to the police pension fund is literally paying police based on what they take from citizens.\n\n* Criminal forfeiture does the job in cases of real need.\n\nThere is an alternate proceeding for seizing assets - criminal forfeiture.  A criminal forfeiture allows police to seize property at the time of arrest like a civil forfeiture.  But importantly, it requires that the defendant be convicted of a crime, and that the judge rule on the property in question being connected to that crime, for the government to keep the property.\n\n\nFor the Philadelphia case about waiving defenses, see [this lawsuit](http://www.ij.org/images/pdf_folder/private_property/philadelphia-forfeiture/philadelphia-forfeiture-complaint-8-11-14.pdf) against the Police and DA's office there.  Particularly page 24 to my specific claim.  Warning: PDF.\n\nFor the case of depositing to pension funds, [here's](http://gothamist.com/2014/01/14/nypd_civil_forfeiture.php) a source on NYC doing that.\n\n\nHot off the presses since I posted this is [a new report](http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2014/10/11/cash-seizures-fuel-police-spending/) in the Washington Post about forfeitures under a state/federal partnership that lets municipalities circumvent laws designed to keep forfeited property out of police hands.

For the last three years, I have lived not far from Boston and I can safely say it and Massachusetts as a whole is too parochial and socially conservative for its alleged liberal leanings. What liberal city and state would do the following.\n\n- Legally obstruct and stall opening medicinal marijuana dispensaries that were approved by referrendum.\n- Have a crippingly puritanical view towards alcohol. No happy hour, not seeing out of state ID's as valid for alcohol purchases, Menino's forcing all bars in Boston to close during the 7th Inning stretch when the Sox were in the World Series, limited supermarket alcohol, no shipping of wine or liquor. It is like the state is assumed drunk.\n- Every industry has a lobby that is too strong. The aforementioned happy hour ban went from MADD running amok to economic protection for a bunch of Boston restaurants (and a few in Amherst) who don't want to lose money. The BPD union is SO strong that police cameras were never even debated when it is a net good.\n- Until recently a firearm ID was necessary to possess pepper spray.\n- Totally ban fireworks, even as harmless as sparklers.\n- Put in mandatory healthcare but make it a headache to get and make it lacking in comparision to other states.\n- Have a ton of latent racism, as seen whenever the Celtics free agent woes or when a black player scores aainst the Bruins in playoff OT happens.\n- Allow rents in Boston and vincinity to go sky high with no plans to mitigate anything or build affordable housing.\n- Take pride in being against outsiders. Townie culture is alive and well especially inside 128 to a degree I never saw anytime in my life.\n- Be outwardly hostile to any ideas that are proven to work elsewhere. Well, outside following Colorado and Washington's path but given how the state is dragging it's feet on dispensaries...\n- The school cutoff in much of the state is September with some holdouts. That just seems a bit too early especially as they are in the minority.\n\nSomeone prove me otherwise that Massachusetts is a forward-leaning state.

CMV + \n + Basically, it comes down to the idea that I believe people should have the right to be wrong. Let me explain....\n\nIf I am a taxpaying homeowner, and let's say I dislike Jews (to pick a random ethnic minority). As a homeowner, I have the right to refuse Jewish people into my home. My home is mine. The same should qualify for a business.\n\nLet's say the CEO of Wal-Mart (just to pick a random company) hates Jews. He hates them so much that he decides that he will not employ any Jewish people nor let them in the store. Why is it different for him to operate his business based on his own personal views and morals as it is for how he handles things at home?\n\nIf the CEO of Wal-Mart decided to do that, he would deal with some harsh consequences. For one, Jews would no longer shop at Wal-Mart. Many non-Jewish citizens would also stop shopping at Wal-Mart because they found that practice to be despicable. Many companies would stop doing business with Wal-Mart because of this practice. The companies that still did business with Wal-Mart would lose most of the same clientele that have stopped supporting Wal-Mart. Many other stores such as Target and K-Mart would thrive on making the public aware that they do not have the hateful policies that Wal-Mart has and would reach out to the customers alienated by Wal-Marts policy. Eventually, the CEO of Wal-Mart would decide to discontinue this practice. Why? Because the millions (or possibly billions) of lost revenue would convince him that having this practice is bad for business. I guarantee if Arizona had allowed their \"keep the gays away\" bill, that whichever businesses decided to exercise that right would lose substantial profits and their competitors would drive them out. \n\nWe saw this happen with Chic-fil-A. It came out that they were funding anti-gay groups, word got out, people protested and boycotted, and they eventually stopped giving to those groups. Did Dan Cathy have a sudden revelation that made him change his mind about gay people? No. He did it because it was in his economic interest. In a capitalist society, it is the responsibility of the consumer to support businesses you want to succeed based on your personal ethics. This is why I believe that anyone complaining about minimum wage but still shops at Wal-Mart or eats at McDonald's is a complete hypocrite. I personally do not buy gas from Exxon due to their treatment of the LGBT community. As a consumer, your purchasing power is your vote. Put it to use.\n\nIgnorant, hateful people have rights to their beliefs just as everyone else does. If someone opens up a discriminatory business, there is a chance that they might be able to stay afloat from the patronage of equally hateful citizens or perhaps citizens that are just apathetic, but it would be a small number, and accepting, non-discriminatory businesses would emerge to accommodate consumers that are more open minded. We saw a lot of right-wing Christians support Chic-fil-A's decisions, but eventually, the company gave in.\n\nI think if a white supremacist wanted to open a whites-only bar for fellow minded people to congregate then it should be his constitutional right. If a huge Dallas Cowboys fan wanted to open up a sports bar that is openly for the Cowboys and they didn't want any Redskins fans in the bar cheering for the other team, they should have the right to refuse them service. It's your business. Do what you want. \n\nJust as a secular government allows religious citizens, but does not make laws honoring religious beliefs. Our goal in a society should not be to force beliefs that are right, but instead learn to let all ideas co-exist no matter how despicable or hateful they may seem as long as they do not infringe on the rights of others. Working or shopping at Wal-Mart is not a civil right. A business is private, just as a home is. "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

We eventually got onto the story of Elisha and how a prayer he issued led to the deaths of 42 young people who were taunting him. The passage from the Bible is as follows:\n\n**\"2 Kings 2:23-24 New International Version (NIV)**\n\n**Elisha Is Jeered**\n\n23 From there Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, some boys came out of the town and jeered at him. \u201cGet out of here, baldy!\u201d they said. \u201cGet out of here, baldy!\u201d \n\n24 He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the Lord. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the boys.\"\n\n[(Source)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+2%3A23-24&amp;version=NIV;KJV)\n\nThe missionaries argued that one problem with the above passage is that 'boys' could potentially refer to anybody up to their twenties, but I'm struggling to see how this makes their deaths morally justifiable. Even if we assume that they were young men acting aggressively and threatening an innocent man, I do not believe that their actions proportionally warranted a violent death at the hands of two bears. \n\nAt an even deeper level though, the passage seems to have several implications for the moral character of God himself. I argued that a kind and loving God might instead choose to grant the 42 youths an epiphany which would lead them to the realisation that taunting people is unacceptable. If nothing else, God could have defended Elisha **if** the youths actually started to use violence against him. The missionaries' rebuttal was that such an act would have been an abridgement of free will, but given that God already decided to abridge their free will by taking away their lives, I'm not sure that this lets God off the hook.\n\nI've read several different interpretations of this story from various Christian websites but I don't accept the widely-accepted conclusion that the aggressive behaviour demonstrated by these youths presented sufficient grounds for their death. I'm therefore highly curious to see if anybody can provide a justification for God's actions in this particular part of the Bible. Thank you.\n\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Whether by lie detectors, tears, pleas or whatever.  Liars adjust and they're out there, paying close attention to what works and what doesn't.  And they are sometimes caught and sometimes get away with it.  And I've got little inherent faith in our justice system to reliably recognize it happening.\n\nAn accusation of the kind of date rape that results in no injury is an extremely hard thing to be certain of.  So I am extremely skeptical of confident numbers that state that 97% of rape accusations are real.  How do we really know?\n\nI don't mean to diminish the importance of the crime by finding it hard to prosecute.  I've got no easy answers.  I've just never been swayed by conclusions that have large intuitive holes.\n\nThis problem is compounded by the tendency to believe the accuser.  This clearly encourages false accusers (I assume there'll be no dispute of that).  But how much?  I don't know?  How does anyone else really know?  \n\nI know the false accusers make the news out of all proportion to the honest accusers but that doesn't change the underlying suspicion I have that things that can be used as weapons (such as false rape accusations) will be used as weapons, and my intuition says it will happen much more frequently than seems to be commonly assumed.  \n\nThis is also complicated by another phenomenon that I never see discussed or considered.  Where the accuser is honest and the denier is honest too.  \"Rape-misunderstandings\" might be the least possible PC thing to acknowledge existing.  Am I the only one who suspects they're out there?  While I assume they're rare, I also suspect they're not discussed because of the \"heat\" generated by accusations.  There is little room to admit honest doubt in one's memories and perceptions (on either side) lest your view is thereby dismissed.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Please CMW + \n + I would like to start by saying this: I can understand english well enough, but when I try to speak english (or write) I tend to ramble. It's a bit difficult to find the words and put them together in a coherent fashion, please bare with me. Also I'm only interested in recent comics, the art is important for me (more precisely I can't stand the coloring of most older comics).\n\nI love superheroes. I simply love them, and I have since I was a little kid (Batman the animated series, Superman the animated series, every justice league ever, young justice, even avatar TLA and korra (I see them as heroes just as much as any other \"mainstream american comic book hero\"). I love them for the power fantasy, the sexuality, the action, the stories, the character development (mostly in the animated versions). Thus as you might imagine, I'd like to read comics (more hero awesomeness. Though I must say I hate the word \"hero\" for some reason but that's a personal quirk). However they are pretty much garbage (or maybe just the ones I've been going trough).\n\nBefore I go into detail, I'd like to say I also hate stuns. I love the idea of a female \"Thor\", I love female protagonists (Korra &lt;3). But this is just a stunt, it won't last. Why keep the name, why not Thoritta, or what ever stupid cheesy name you'd like but not Thor (or a good name ... that could also work). Sure this way it'll sell more, but it's stupid. I don't care what you have to say, this particular view won't change. Thor is Thor, it's his name, not his title.  \n\nBack on topic: I'd like to start with catwoman of the new 52 post writer change where NOTHING MAKES ANY SENSE WHAT SO EVER, but I'll also give more specific examples.\n\nDc Comics: Injustice year one: Batman &amp; Catwoman meets with the US prez, he wants to talk to bats, but not catwoman because she's a criminal ... batman goes: \"Are you telling me every action you took in office has been legal ?\". Is it just me or is that just a stupid way of phrasing that ? Wouldn't \"Like you're clean ?\" be more natural, less stiff ?\n\nDc Comics: Red Hood: Starfire, just Starfire. She can't tell humans apart ? she is a human in just about every important way, nor can she remember names, but what ever. The way the writers make her wanting sex all the time just because \"fan service\" (she sees no difference between humans, she does not remember them, nor recolonize them ... but sex!!! God, they ruined the animated version of her T_T), that is horrible. Then the ret-con about her lying (she actually does remember them ... stupid).\n\nDc Comics: Teen Titans: The culling ... just horrible in of itself.\n\nAlso I have never seen a comic being smart, usually it's writers trying to be smart. I don't even know what else to say. But I'd like to discuss.\n\nP.S. Am I the only one who just can't stand \"The world's greatest detective\" when talking about batman. The way he's been written recently I'd rather call him \"the world's luckiest angst-filled teenager-man-baby\".

I'm perfectly happy with doing this, since I enjoy making others happy. But at the same time, the current economics of the world makes me almost want to sell it somehow, for the purpose of making money. If I do something from which I can get something back, why would I refuse that?\n\nI know that many companies and people do donate a lot and try to help the general public. But most of these people are extremely wealthy, with a lot money to spare. Poorer families have to work very hard for enough money to sleep and eat, leaving them little to no time to help the community. In no way do I want to say that poor people are bad people, but when regularly helping others for the sake of helping becomes a fantasy, self-gain becomes the top-priority.\n\nI think the mentality of selfishness is a byproduct of capitalism that harms humanity. Take the Reddit-infamous example of Comcast. I don't think it's as bad as the community makes it out to be, but no one can deny that their overpowering influence doesn't help the public to the extent that a company that large should. Google's fiber internet gives people 20-200x faster internet, often for less, but the expansion of gigabit internet is limited in that no large company wants to help Google, or even upgrade their systems themselves. Why? Because it costs money and reduces profit that many companies would rather just hoard. This obsession with money slows advancement and has companies spending the bare minimum and giving their customers the bare minimum.\n\nI admit that plausible solutions to these problems may seem scarce, but somehow, dependence on money should be lowered.

Loud voices have emerged from that debate, stating that people should be allowed to believe whatever they want as long as it does not directly harm anyone.\n\nIt's my view that this position is incorrect for a number of reasons, and more harmful than the alternatives. There may in fact be more of a net benefit for people's spirituality, from education about our reality than by defending their right to stay wrong. Again, my issue is not with the people who hold the outdated views. The reality is that most adult humans reach adulthood already holding strong views, and won't switch away from them in most circumstances. If they have taken the time to debate with others and look at information regarding their world and tried to come to a rational conclusion, yet decide to still hold on to outdated views, there is not much that any human can do. \n\nDefending their right to stay wrong is definitely not a good course of action, as it directly promotes that correctness is not important or valuable in our society. This has far reaching implications in how our surroundings think, especially in how these hard-headed adults bring their children up.\n\nIf someone actively chooses to be incorrect in regards to how they see the world, the best thing we can do is try to educate them. The middle ground is ignoring them completely, hope their children use the Internet and seek out knowledge and that they aren't making decisions based on their worldview. **The worst case scenario is defending their right to believe whatever they want.** \n\nLet's take an example: Bob believes that God is real. He can't really define what God is, but thinking that someone is always watching him feels good. Rebecca tries to explain to him the history of religion, and how the belief in God came from not understanding nature and humans requiring a catch-all to explain things. She explains to him that we now know what the stars are, and that we are actually star material. She explains that praying feels good because introspection is important, and how although there is no \"thing\" watching over him, the beauty of life itself is way cooler anyways.\n\nBob thinks about it and decides that although those arguments might make scientific sense they don't make him any happier. Accepting one's place in the cosmos takes too much humility, and instead of working on that, Bob takes the intellectually lazy approach and just stays with good olde God. \n\nThe next best outcome is not Rebecca defending his right to hold incorrect views about the world. It's Rebecca not saying anything. **If someone defends that we're allowed to believe whatever we want all it does is promote intellectual laziness, and potentially encourages actually harmful views to materialize and propagate.**\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

So I'd like to see if I'm missing something, as I generally consider myself a fairly progressive person. I don't want to end up as one of \"those old people who won't change their ways\" like many people see older people who dislike gay marriage, so I would honestly like some light shed on why gender is necessary. \n\n\nFirst and foremost: I am not saying that \"gender\" should mean \"man or woman,\" or that trans people aren't real. I am saying that I do not believe there is a reason for gender to exist.\n\nGender is related to masculinity or femininity. As a construct, it does not describe just a person's biological sex, but how they fit into \"gender roles\" or \"gender stereotypes.\"\n\n1. Many gender stereotypes are culturally created. Many jobs which are deemed \"women's jobs\" or \"men's jobs\" are called such because it's ingrained in our culture that they should be. However, in most cases, there is no good reason why these fields should be male- or female-dominated, and I feel that doing so is sexist to both genders, and encourages feelings such as \"this person doesn't belong here, they're not a man/woman,\" where those feelings should not exist. For example, nurses are traditionally a \"woman's job,\" and male nurses are often made fun of for their profession. These gender stereotypes are harmful, and should not exist.\n\n2. Other stereotypes involve what a particular person acts like or likes doing. \"Feminine\" men are made fun of for speaking a particular way, or enjoying things traditionally associated with women. These men may very well be completely straight men, but many people will assume they are gay, or trans, or something based on only their mannerisms. \"Masculine\" women are often made fun of for liking things typically associated with men, and may act \"non-feminine.\" These women, who may very well be completely straight women are often derided for possibly being lesbian, or for being \"too butch.\" These gender stereotypes are harmful, and should not exist.\n\n3. Any actual differences between males and females stem from biology. In such cases, gender has no reason to exist, as it's superfluous when we already have biological sex as a descriptor.\n\n4. Having gender as a \"spectrum\" or having things that are \"masculine\" or \"feminine\" leads to more harmful comparisons. When \"masculine\" is equated with \"being a man\" (as it is in the gender social construct), it implies that a man who likes more masculine things than another man is \"more of a man\" than a man who may enjoy fewer masculine things and more feminine things. The same goes for women. Why should someone who is a nurse and likes cooking, crafts, and Pinterest (things typically associated with women) be \"more of a woman\" than someone who is a professional bodybuilder and likes sports, cars, and MMOs (things typically associated with men)? They shouldn't. Associating interests or professions with \"masculinity\" or \"femininity\" opens up shaming for being \"less of a man\" or \"less of a woman.\" Again, it's toxic, and should not exist.\n\n5. In the ideal case where gender, as a concept, does not exist, the worst possible scenario is that biological sex takes the place of gender, and sex stereotypes remain. In this scenario, there is no difference. However, in the best case scenario, many gender stereotypes lessen or disappear, and people are no longer derided for having interests not associated with their sex. In this scenario, there is a positive change. Because of these scenarios, I believe the existence of the concept of gender has no positive implications.\n\nAgain, this does not preclude the existence of transsexual people. Sexual dysmorphia exists. People would still be allowed to change their sex to the other. However, ideally there would be no cases of transgender people who do not wish to biologically change sex, because gender as a whole would not exist, and thus there would be no gender dysphoria. People who are transgender currently but do not want to change sex would not feel pressure to do things associated with their sex, and thus there would be no gender roles from which dysphoria would stem. The only difference between men and women would be biological. Anything short of sexual dysmorphia would be meaningless and serve no purpose.\n\nFurthermore, before someone inevitably brings up Kleinfelter syndrome, triple X syndrome, etc., I am acknowledging that they exist.

I've worked in most sorts of positions, from fast food fry cook to fine dining server, and later as a general manager. As a rule, I tip **very** well: For an exceptional experience, 50%. (That's right; If my server is truly exceptional, I'll tip 50% of the meal's price.) If the server is very, very good, 30%. For service that is average, 25%. Even a server that I would describe as \"meh,\" who makes a mistake or two perhaps, but is polite and clearly making an effort in good faith will earn the \"standard\" of 15% from me. I will *not* tip less than 15%.\n\nThat said, if a server is simply *bad*, meaning that they are dismissive, rude, overly forgetful, inattentive, smelly, or something like that, I will *not* leave them a tip. People who are bad servers simply do not deserve to be tipped, and they certainly do not deserve to be tipped *well*.\n\nI know that they live off of their tips, but that's really the point; They *shouldn't* be able to live off of tips if they are simply bad at their job. Their misery and the misery of the patrons at their establishment will only be prolonged if they are allowed to earn a living wage doing something for which they are clearly ill-suited. In the long run, they will be better-off if they are encouraged to find something else by their inability to support themselves being a server.\n\nUnfortunately, many restaurant managers are insufficiently proactive in terminating bad employees. The \"little push\" of being stiffed only aids in quickening turnover that management should probably be taking into their own hands but don't.\n\nAs an aside, expediting the exit of poor servers will only serve to keep positions open for those who have an aptitude or would do the job well through hard work.\n\nMore people should stiff bad servers, it seems, as I'm finding them to be more and more common.\n\nChange my view!\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Any honorary degrees given out, to me, appears to be more like a PR stunt to associate themselves with a particular academic, or even celebrity, and seem just a little pathetic.\n\n\n\ninflate someone's ego e.g  now you have to call me Dr and the way honorary degrees can be paid for.

The only time I got great grades in math was when I had a teacher that I later learned graded work and tests upon completion not accuracy\n\nI hold my view because I feel like after looking at math compared to other subjects, it seems like math is the only true subject. Science, technology and engineering (the rest of STEM) are all highly based in math and one could not succeed in either of those subjects without a high skill in math.\n\nI look at history and other social studies and see only memorizing facts, dates and concepts.

When I look at all the English and lit classes that I have taken (all of them honors and A.P) at school I feel like the classes boil down to ones opinion of a text so there is no right or wrong answer as long as you can justify your answer. I can not think of any other subject that works this way and feel that even though I am good in this subject it seems rather useless unless you want to be a teacher, which I would only do if I had no other employment options. \n\nWhen I look at mathematics I see a genuine skill, not memorization or justifying your opinion. There is only a single correct answer in math (I know there are a few exceptions but that is besides the point). At my school at least (I just graduated from a relatively small high school, graduating class of about 120) high level math classes are a strong indicator of intelligence. People at my school were shocked to learn that I was not in calculus (the highest level of math at my school) or even the level before it. My classmates often assumed me to be intelligent, due to the fact that I took several non math AP classes but I do not feel intelligent. \n\nMy low math scores on the SAT as well as my gpa made mine significantly lower than most of my friends. I feel that me not being good at math shows that I am less intelligent and that math is single best way to measure a persons intelligence. \n\nI am very nervous about what to major in since I feel I could try to struggle through a STEM major, or study what interests me (the notion of doing what you love over what will make money has always bother me. Every non STEM major I am interested are considered to be some of the most useless majors around. I am afraid that if I major in a liberal  arts subject that my job prospects will be horrendous\n\nI feel that math is the best way to measure a persons intelligence, even if it means that I am not intelligent.

CMV + \n + **WARNING**: **Long-winded rant.** I have been holding this in for a long time, and have not found a single person or a single argument on Reddit that can change my view, so I posted here for others to challenge me, and hopefully get you to change your views about the situation. I accept that I could be wrong, but I need to see evidence of that. Thus far, I have not found it. Granted, I may be looking in the wrong places.\n\nI hold my view because I'm a patriot and love my country. However, I will admit that I am not a big fan of our government. It doesn't mean I'm anti-government (we do need checks and balances), I just don't like some things.\n\nI honestly believe that Edward Snowden is the biggest traitor in recent history, and has done more to damage the United States than anyone else. I feel like he should be executed for his crimes. \n\nSnowden's release of information on the NSA has allowed terrorists to change their tactics, know what works and what doesn't. It also allows criminals and other malicious individuals to know how to avoid NSA spying so they can essentially change their tactics and become more successful in their malicious endeavours.\n\nI realize people here don't like being spied on (I don't either, I absolutely hate it), but they missed crucial information regarding the September 11th attacks because they had no system in place to really intercept intelligence signals. Truth be told, I was ashamed of my country for not being able to deal with pre-9/11 security issues properly. \n\nI actually saw threats on the WTC on a message board about incoming attacks a day before they happened, but I was too young to know what to do. I have always felt that the U.S. government was so far behind on technology that it made me feel like it was a direct threat to U.S. national security, and I figured we had only useless dinosaurs in the government who didn't know anything about anything. \n\nWhen the Boston Bombings happened, I realize we missed the intelligence provided from Russia, and that's definitely something we need to look into. It indicates a failure to take threats of terrorism seriously, and the people who ignored it need to be fired. \n\nAnyway, just because PRISM can't catch all attacks doesn't mean that the NSA's spying is useless and needs to be scrapped. We don't know what they've intercepted, or what they've caught. \n\nThe director of the NSA has been caught lying constantly before congress. He's also swears up and down that the program has saved many lives and stopped many threats. I actually believe him when he says that, because if I were in his position, I would deny everything I could in order to protect the secrecy of the program, in order to keep gathering information on terrorists, suspected terrorists, criminals, etc. \n\nU.S. National Security is more important to me than my job, and my life. I truly believe that America is a beacon of hope in the world, and keeps countries like North Korea, Russia and China from rising up and causing a LOT of pain and suffering to their neighbors. \n\nI do wonder if I've talked to Snowden in the past, because someone who claimed to work at the NSA told me all about those things several years before it came out. At the time, it scared the shit out of me and made me feel paranoid (kinda like PRISM does). Over time, I began to realize the potential of it. Now that guy could've been a conspiracy theorist who hit home, but if it were an actual employee who worked at the NSA, or with the NSA, then I deem him a traitor. Just like Snowden.\n\nDo we really need to reveal all our national security secrets to everyone? We used these methods to gain information on governments who may or may not have been hostile to each other, and we shared them with our allies. It helps to save a lot of lives in such a messed up world. \n\nIn my opinion, Edward Snowden has gone out of his way to make it more difficult for us to achieve intelligence goals, to track terrorists, and has caused us to lose critical information at critical times. Snowden may have put a lot of lives in jeopardy, even if that may not have been his intention, and we may not know the full scope until the damage is done. \n\nHe signed an NDA, and a contract of secrecy with the government. If he couldn't keep his mouth shut, he should've shouldn't have taken the job, and at the very least he should've quit and left it at that. "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

We no longer have a need for religion or a need to fear death as we can now answer many of the questions that people fled to religion to find.\n\n\n**1) Religion was created to answer questions of the unknown, we now have other resources that can answer these questions for us.**\n\n* Science and technology have not only disproved religion but have made it almost obsolete. We now understand human biology, space &amp; time (for the most part), human psychology, chemistry, plant life, animal life, water, air, drugs, sociology, there is a lot more that we know now that were unthinkable in the days of religion. We no longer need religious texts to help us understand life.\n\n\n\n**2) Religious books are outdated.**\n\n* They're old, and they preach teachings of a much more ignorant and fearful time. (If you need further explanation here then refer yourself to the Bible, Koran, Torah, you get it. Or just do a basic google search, \"bigotry in the _____\")\n\n\n\n**3) Religion has taught us to fear more than it has to love and has created utter hysteria on the topic of life and death.**\n\n* Religion teaches that when you die you have two options in the afterlife, eternal happiness in paradise, or eternal damnation. This has caused people to worry over what will happen to them when they die and makes them act differently while alive as they only live to set their place in the afterlife.\n\n* Because of religion people have been taught to fear death. Death is an inevitable event beyond our current comprehension that has existed since the beginning of time. It is not only pointless to fear death, but absurd.\n\n* Death is something in life that is uncontrollable and simply just happens. We don't have to understand death or what happens after death, we just have to understand it and accept it.\n\n* Death happens everyday, that's how life works, trying to come up with an answer to \"comfort\" yourself with is illogical and irrational. Accept that it happens, just like birth, and move on so that the fear of death is not lingering over you for the rest of your life.\n\n\n\n**4) Religion separates humanity.**\n\n* When a certain train of thought is drilled into someone mind, it is hard for them to change their views and no longer accept what they thought was true for so long. This has caused a separation of logical, progressive and political thought as people are on opposite sides of the spectrum on many social matters due to the teachings of their religion and has held back humanity atrociously.\n\n* The separation that religion has caused can also be tied in with the problem of nationalism, but instead of people from different countries hating each other, you have people in the same countries who start violent feuds with each other due to different beliefs, even though all of their beliefs preach \"non-violence\" and \"respect\". \n\n\n\n**5) Finally, people who cling to religion lack proper intellect and reasoning.**\n\n* People so foolishly cling to religion as a form of comfort because they are too ignorant to open themselves to a different train of thought. It scares them to think that what they have relied on for so long is false and believe that a world without religion would be utter chaos.\n\n* People who rely on religion need to wake up and escape the ignorant mindset that has been almost engraved into them. \n\n* We need to stop preaching and supporting religion in our society as it is detrimental to the growth of human intellect, and is nothing but a flawed and hypocritical system that is run on fear, subjugation and false attainment/happiness.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Westboro Baptist hates people who have made an unhealthy religious choice, in their eyes. The KKK hates Catholics and Jews (supposedly the religious definition, too). These traditional hate groups drape their fanaticism of others' choices in altruism, too.\n\nIt reminds me of the proponents of the War on Drugs or abortion restrictions. They totally fabricated society-destroying fears of marijuana use and abortion. They came up with altruistic reasons they needed to shame and control others' decisions and lives. Are we condoning this control-of-others'-lives-and-choices mindset?\n\nIf we wish to debunk the concept that obesity is healthy, that seems fine. But, plump folks are choosing to live fewer years due to calorie consumption...who fucking cares?

CMV. + \n + By \"single use restroom\" I mean a public restroom with a lockable door that allows only one occupant at a time. I don't know if these are common all over the world but they are very common in the United States\n\nNow, I understand the advantages of a single use restroom. They take up less space, are cheaper to build, and offer more privacy to the user. However, at least in the US, there are often two of them, one for men and one for women, and I really don't see the point of this practice. The most convincing argument I've read against unisex restrooms is that some people are uncomfortable urinating/defecating around the opposite sex, but this doesn't apply to single use restrooms since the occupant is alone anyway.\n\nWhat if there are five women in line for a single use restroom, but no men? That line of women could be moving twice as fast if they had two restrooms available. Unfortunately for them, the other restroom is only for men, so they're just going to have to hold it.\n\nThis restriction strikes me as totally arbitrary. It has an obvious downside with no notable upsides that I can see. That said, I've already had /r/changemyview flip my opinion several times when I really wasn't expecting it to. Maybe there are some points I haven't considered."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Multiculturalism is the way of the world, and I'm all for it. Plus, immigrants bring fresh ideas (and delicious food). Not to mention that English is an insanely difficult language even for native speakers, so I'm not going to begrudge people for speaking it with an accent.\n\nWhat I do have a problem with is people who speak English fluently and with an American accent suddenly lapsing into another accent to say a specific word. This mainly arises with Latinos using identity markers ('latino', 'chicano') or foods ('quesadilla'). However, most of these words have been adopted into English as true loanwords; English speakers understand them and use them often. But I often hear people on the news, e.g. a policy analyst of Latin-American extraction, using words like \"latino\" with a Spanish lilt that sounds (to me) out-of-place and exaggerated.\n\nSuddenly switching to another accent, at best, is confusing, as it takes the listener's brain that extra millisecond to adapt to a new style of speaking. At worst, it sounds kind of pretentious and exclusionary.\n\nI'm not arguing that we should completely anglify these words -- I don't want to hear someone pronounce 'quesadilla' with a hard L sound, like the grandma in Napoleon Dynamite. Rather I think we should treat Spanish loanwords like we do words like \"kindergarden\" (German), \"sake\" (Japanese), or \"joie de vivre\" (French) -- try as best we can to respect the original pronunciation, but maintain our typical accent when saying them.\n\nDoing otherwise is just kind of disrespectful. To illustrate: I am a reasonably proficient Spanish speaker and have spent a lot of time in Spanish-speaking countries. Once I was speaking with a local (edit: in Spanish) and used the word \"iPod\", which left him scratching his head. I couldn't figure out why -- I knew, in fact, that he owned one too. Then it hit me -- I was pronouncing the 'i' sound like the English \"eye\", which is a confusing sound for Spanish speakers, especially when surrounded by Spanish words. Once I pronounced it as \"ee-Pod\", he immediately knew what I was talking about. From then on, when speaking Spanish, I always try to 'spanishify' the pronunciation of vowel sounds to avoid these kind of misunderstandings.\n\nSo CMV.\n\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In many places this includes a cash handout. I believe this is wrong on many levels. \n\n* The money may be misspent. This idea is NOT based on the assumption that poor people are all stupid or drug addicts. It's simply the fact that there's no way of ensuring that the cash is used for its intended purpose. The best assumption you can make is that people would be so desperately craving the thing you give them extra money for that they would almost certainly spend it on that, but people may end up endure forms of squalor that were far from what the well intentioned policy makers had in mind. \n\n* From the government's perspective, money is also being spent inefficiently. Let's say a program wanted to ensure that people were well fed. They'd have to find a cash amount that would buy enough healthy food to feed the recipients, but people have different needs, so they'll have to provide to the upper percentile of demand (the alternative is weighing people, paying women less etc.) This not only will result in discretionary income, but inequality in how much everyone gets. A food stamp system would allow everyone to get as much food as they need, and the money left over is still in the governments hands to spend on other initiatives.\n\n* Things like food stamps are patronising, and that's a good thing. A cash handout creates a sense of entitlement beyond what something \"patronising\" like food stamps, rent vouchers etc. create. By the time money's in your pocket or bank account, there's several layers between you and the people providing that service. Food stamps create a meaningful difference between working poor and welfare recipients to encourage escaping the system. There's also the huge benefit of less resentment of those on welfare.\n\n* In general they communicate purpose more clearly. Too often there's an attitude of getting as much money as you can from the government, and paying as little tax as possible. It seems like people would be less likely to trick their way into receiving food stamps, education and other initiatives purpose built to meet needs. On the other side, I would think policies would allow people to see their taxes as less of a redistribution of wealth, and more as funding for benevolent programs to create a better society.\n\nI think as much welfare as possible should be in the form of vouchers and other purpose specific, non discretionary forms. I like food stamps, I like rent vouchers, I like free healthcare and education. Things like these over cash seem like the best way to prevent the safety net becoming a fishing net. I can't think of many situations where cash is the best option, which is why I'm here.\n\nThe other aspect to this changemyview is that I'm ok with policies that \"patronise\" the less fortunate. Being well fed, healthy, comfortably sheltered, continually educated to eventually earn the life you want are more important than not being insulted. If anyone can enlighten me on what it's like to be offended by a government policy assuming you're stupid or malevolent (especially if you don't pay taxes), that would be helpful."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

This mostly discusses the Old Testament.\n\nI believe that God is more evil than Satan, and that when God or any of his prophets describe himself as \"loving\" or \"good\", or describes Satan as \"evil\", he is simply lying.\n\nIt's difficult to find actual examples in the Bible of Satan acting evil, and it seems that nearly every instance which could be described as \"evil\", is more often better described as \"against God\". If God is a character of pure good, then this would be evil, but if actions speak louder than words, there's very little evidence of God being good.\n\n* He's incredibly jealous, and regularly kills followers of other gods.\n\n* He killed who-knows-how-many people with the Flood.\n\n* He once killed 40 kids for calling a guy bald.\n\n* He wants his followers to be willing to kill their own children because he said so.

He got Adam &amp; Eve to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which is one of those things that falls under the \"against god\" category; I think that knowledge of good and evil is a pretty good thing.

They may drop their morals and eat meat if they're vegetarian, for example, or cheat on their partner when in a relationship. As much as it is shameful for doing this, there's a good chance they would never have done it while sober.\n\nThis is the point in the discussion where people normally say \"But they *chose* to get drunk, therefore they need to deal with the consequences!\" and this may be true for a lot of cases - they will often have to deal with their partner breaking up with them for cheating, but they can move on from this easier than say; being put to jail for drunk driving.\n\nSo, in what way do people change when they get drunk? I know of quite a few people who suddenly become easily led, despite being strong and independent while sober. I know of people who become forgetful, they literally *forget* that they're a vegetarian, or that it's wrong to flirt with someone when in a relationship. Also, what if someone has 100% forgotten the incident due to drunkenness -- is it fair to say that it's as if *it wasn't actually them*?\n\nSo, if someone is peer pressured into driving while very drunk, I don't think they should be so heavily prosecuted, as people can become more susceptible to peer pressure or can even forget what they're doing is wrong.\n\nChange my view. \n\n\nYou have one drink. This effects you ever so slightly, but not enough to change how you act significantly. So you have a second through *almost* sober choice. Then maybe a third or even a fourth, still reasonably unaffected. Then you become a bit more \"slurred\" and blas\u00e9 about your actions, so I believe any further drinking is no longer a consequence of the sober and sensible mindset you had at the start. Your opinion of when you've had enough is different when you're sober to when you're drunk. Your first drink was taken by your sober mindset, the second by the mindset created by the first, the third by the second, and so on. Your sober mind doesn't have control over every drink as soon as you've had your first."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

You are happy being yourself, and you change yourself for *your own* benefit rather than to fit society's norms.\n\n**Thank you all.** The movement doesn't necessarily sound like a good thing now. I've heard from a lot of you that it glorifies being overweight and that many people in the movement believe that being overweight is an unchangeable fact about yourself and that you should just embrace it. I think I always read \"fat acceptance\" as accepting overweight/obese people for who they are and not criticizing them for their weight, when it's actually so much more (and not all of it good).

CMV + \n + Throughout the last months of the Pacific conflict, the US navy and air force were carrying out heavy bombing campaigns against Japanese targets, such as Tokyo and Kyoto. These included firebombings and incredibly destructive attacks on mainly civilian targets. Some historians speculate that up to 400,000 Japanese civilians were killed in two months of firebombing alone. The US would have continued these bombings in the event that they did not end the war with the bomb, or through some other means. The dropping of the bombs signaled the end of the war, and therefore, prevented even more civilian casualties. Therefore, it was completely justified and should not be as controversial as it is. Change my view, I'm open to any angle or argument, just try to stay as un-biased as possible. "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

CMV + \n + For the uninitiated, in the philosophy of science the demarcation problem considers how to distinguish science from non-science. Karl Popper, a 20th century philosopher, suggested that the line separating a scientific theory from a non-scientific theory is whether or not a theory is falsifiable. He also suggested that falsified theories be rejected for newer, unfalsified but falsifiable theories. I think this is inadequate, and that a theory should be measured by its successes rather than its failures.\n\nI believe this for two reasons. First, I believe that the way science is actually practiced should be taken into consideration when discussing the demarcation problem. I believe that this is by evaluating the successes of the theory rather than judging it based on a falsification criterion. Secondly, I believe that the falsificationism principle cannot keep up with where science is taking us. \n\nConsider the first point. When factual evidence is uncovered that undermines a well-established theory it is often rejected outright. If it is not rejected, the theory is modified slightly to accommodate the new facts. Therefore, the theory stands on its previous successes rather than succumbs to falsification attempts. This is not to say an established theory is never replaced or superseded, but I do think this demonstrates that too much import is placed on falsification, when in reality science is hardly ever practiced this way. Most science is done within the scope of a theory. I would argue that a really well established theory is in practice unfalsifiable. It can only be amended or superseded.\n\nSo how is a scientific theory established anyhow? By its successes! You can argue that this is semantic -- that any success of a scientific theory is its passing a falsification test, but in practice I think that scientists pay a lot more attention to how successful predictions of a theory have been rather than to what degree it has failed falsification tests. These are not one and the same! Consider how general relativity was established. It predicted a few major things that distinguished it from competing theories such as the precessing perihelion of mercury and the deflection of starlight during an eclipse. When Arthur Eddington established that starlight did indeed bend during an eclipse, the theory gained widespread support. Forget the fact that there was much that remained to be tested. It was the successes that gained it support.\n\nFinally, I think that falsificationism leaves little to no room for inductive reasoning. I think that this has historically been very important in science, such as in the discovery of relativity, and I think that it's importance is only growing. There is plenty of science that can't pragmatically be falsified because of technological or temporal constraints. Consider the question of quantum gravity. Because of technological limitations, theories of quantum gravity will be untestable for the foreseeable future. If falsificationism had its way, those studying the quatum gravity problem from a theoretical perspective would be on par with priests and mystics. So what separates String theory (a theory of quantum gravity) from religion? Its success, of course! It is the only theory, per my knowledge, that can definitely combine quantum mechanics and general relativity in a logically consistent way. Whether or not the theory is correct remains to be seen, but because of its success its status should be squarely in the domain of science.\n\nThese are my views, anyway. CMV"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

But typically speaking, people who are intelligent and hardworking can easily manage a household in a few hours a day, and use the rest of the time to have fun with the kids, like on an extended vacation. **Let it be known: I have no disrespect for people who take advantage of being a stay-at-home parent, since I would do it in a second** if my partner made enough money and was willing to work while lounged around and worked on hobbies all day, after the kids were tended to. Who wouldn\u2019t?? I lose respect for them when they try to tell me it is difficult.\n \nI do understand that it is hard work for some people but that is the result of being lazy, inefficient or...just not very smart. If they were very good at managing time and/or people, they would either still be in the work force, or at home LOVING being able to relax most of the day. If the kids are horribly behaved devils, then that also bodes poorly for the SAH parent. Even though some children have severe behavior disorders, this is not the case most of the time\u2026.it\u2019s simply lazy parenting. \n\nCleaning, laundry, study time with kids, paying bills, managing doctors\u2019 appointments, etc. are things that ALL parents have to do any way. When a SAH parent lists these in the \"overwhelming responsibilities\" that they do every day, I will ALWAYS mentally knock them down a few inches in my respect for them as a person. \n\nIn short, a lot of stay at home parents who claim to \"have the most difficult job in the world\" are really just not good at anything else.

Then, I researched it, and I'm like \"Is this what all the fuss is about?\". It seemed that it could be a Utopia where everybody works togather, towards a goal, and everybody is equel, and everybody has an equel shot at promotions and moving up in the system (i.e. rewards for their effort).\n\n I turn on the TV to see celebrities like the Kardasians that have no talent what-so-ever, get paid for stuff 99.99999(repeating 9)% of the population would have to pay to do (spend money, relax, live a very nice life).

So the coffee industry is huge, profitable industry, but then I look on the internet and see the people who grow the coffee beans, and they and their family live in horrible conditions. \n\nSo to me Communism looks like it could be a very successful economy as long as everybody is incharge of the money distributes (or it will just get more like Capitalism) through a democratic government where one person cannot get too powerful, and everybody has a say in what goes (According to wikipedia, **[The working and lower classes make up 55% percent of America](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_lower_class#mediaviewer/File:Gilbert_model.png)** so why does it seem the government is always working for the rich?).

The Millet system is an alternate model for federalism in which rather than have state laws apply over strict geographical regions, the government is composed of Millets whose law applies to its people rather than places.\n\nThe first example of a Millet system is the Ottoman's system, in which Millets were defined by religion. However Millets could also be constructed around ethnicity, language, nationality, or whatever trait that could hold a person to identify with their Millet. A system where upon reaching adulthood a person may choose to be a citizen of whichever Millet they wish would work too.\n\nFor the 13 colonies a free form Millet system seems most appropriate to me. 13 millets would exist, perhaps additions ones for Native Americans.\n\nAs the millets have no strict geographical boundaries, merely the rough boundaries that exist defined by where people belonging to each Millet live, the issue of slave states would not have occurred. In fact I find it a lot less likely that a civil war could've occurred at all.\n\nThis would've made a lot of the issues the US had with the state system void, but preserved the benefits of a federal system.\n\nThere are obviously problems with the Millet system of course. Such as the complications of committing crimes where the perpetrators and victims are abiding by different millet laws."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

CMV. + \n + My view is twofold: 1) most or even all things people do for jobs today will be possible to automate within 3-5 decades.  For many types of blue collar as well as white-collar work, machines will be better than people 100% of the time. \n\nFurthermore, human usefulness is finite.  It pains us as humans to admit it, but a machine that is a better general-purpose worker than all or nearly all people is a theoretical possibility, and after enough time, a certainty. \n\n2) Jobs will be automated out of existence so much faster than we can come up with new ones, due to the (surprisingly rapid) introduction of such technology.  This, barring structural changes to policy or our economy, will cause permanent, very high unemployment.\n\nI won't rehash all the news about automation, machine learning, and AI research speeding up and reaching important thresholds here, but I don't see any way around this. \n\nStated alternately, my view is this: \n\n1) Technology will become good enough to replace, rather than simply augment workers, in large numbers.  2) This will result in many people being unable to compete in the labor market.  There will be no market for many types of labor.  3) Many people won't be capable of performing any type of labor for which there is a market.  4) the market for labor is basically over at this point.

This means falling long term average cost of labor - IMO this will proceed below any acceptable wage. \n\nFor reference, I believe this will all begin to happen quite noticeably within 30 years, and will be all but over in 70-80 years. \n\nCMV?

If I make 20K a year and get pulled over for speeding and receive a $150.00 ticket, the punishment will make me think about not speeding again because that was a significant hit to my monthly budget.  However; if I make 60k a year that same punishment of $150.00 will have a significantly less effect on my desire to not do that same crime.  And the more money I make, the less that flat rate policy will deter me from repeating the crime.  So I have always stated that monetary punishment should be scaled to personal income level. CMV.\n\n\n I would say one of my favorites were those stating the problem in unemployed or those that make no income. I think a solution to this would obviously to be put a \"floor cap\"  on the monetary punishment.\n\nAnother interesting point is that the police would only go after wealthy people. I feel the argument against this is: 1. The police should be neutral in their actions by the job description. 2. you can't give someone a ticket unless they are speeding, so wealthy don't always speed. 3. Wealthy don't always drive Ferraris people, plenty of cheap daily commuters out there driven by very wealthy people.\n\nThe idea that the wealthy would pay other people to drive for them is a little silly. for one, most professional drivers drive the speed limit so what's the benefit for rich people when they could just do that themselves? \n\nI would say over all a lot of the arguments here had some pretty big assumptions, (everybody speeds, cops would filch on their duty's and only target the wealthy, police departments would set unreasonably high quotas,) but there were some good arguments.

Many black people do not have that. Imagine if everyone in your immediate family that you could reach out to for help was just as poor as you. While this is a reality for whites as well, it is a harsh reality for a larger number of blacks.\n\nWhen you have generational poverty, it's a lot harder to break out of poverty yourself, when you have no positive influences and noone to support you while you go to school, or teach you etc.\n\nWhen you are in poverty, you tend to be more desperate and commit more crimes.\n\nWhen you commit more crimes, you tend to interact with the police more. \n\n\n\nThe more desperate you are, the more violent crimes you commit, and the more lethal the response from police.\n\n\n\nIt is true, black people do commit a disproportionate number of crimes compared to white people, but they also are disproportionately poorer, which as I stated leads to desperation.\n\n(NOTE: There are more white criminals than black criminals, but only because black people are a minority. Black people are *proportionately* charged with crimes more than white people)\n\n\n\nAm I excusing the behavior of criminals? No, I am simply cosigning those that trumpet the \"black crime statistics\" as it is indeed a societal problem, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the color of their skin or genetics, and everything to do with cause and effect over the last 150 years.\n\nAm I saying we should feel white guilt? Fuck no, I sure as hell don't. Even the most persecuted members of this country have it far better than the starving people in other countries. It is what it is.\n\nThe only way out of this mess, in my opinion, is to fund all schools equally. Give an equal share of tax dollars to the rich schools as well as the inner city ones. Then our next generation might have a chance at producing less criminals (of any race).\n\nWhy does Beverly Hills High need a day spa, when Compton High can't afford working computers?\n\nI'm not advocating a re-distribution of wealth, but when it comes to government provided services, they should all be provided equally, especially something as crucial as this.\n\nI am absolutely against giving blanket handouts to poor people. I am not a fan of public assistance.\n\nTechnically though, we are all on the public assistance dole unless you send your kids to private school. If you want to break the cycle of poverty, provide kids of all socioeconomic classes a fair chance.\n\nGiving special college grants to people of a specific, disadvantaged race or class is worthless, because at that point they already received an inferior education from their crappy public school, and by letting them into your college with a lower score you are lowering the standard for everyone.\n\nInvest all the NAACP/affirmative action college grant BS into public schools instead so they can get into college on their own merit.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

With standard paternity tests done at birth, much of this could be avoided, all without having to force a man to accuse his partner of being unfaithful.\n* Possibly better for relationships. For some men, myself included, I feel I would be able to have a better relationship with the child if I knew without a doubt it was mine. There would never be any nagging questions at the back of my mind.\n* No man would ever get tricked into paying for a child that wasn't his, unless he explicitly took that risk (by opting out of the test).\n\nSo reddit, why WOULDN'T this be a good idea?

In my view, LGBT couples are already married, regardless of the legislation that is imposed on them.

But marriage isn't that, it is simple commitment to another person. The main issue that gay marriage has is that not all couples are given the same civil liberties, but this does not mean that their marriages are void. Marriage isn't decided by bystanders, it's decided by the people who live inside the union. It is for this very reason that a gay couple getting married doesn't affect your own marriage. \n\nI've held this opinion for a while but have never had the opportunity to see if it stood up to criticism.

I think many (most?) of us have a strong emotional reaction to witnessing a fellow citizen break a rule of some sort, depending on the situation, and the subconscious reasons why are interesting to me. So here we go...\n\n**Area Description:** I was stuck in traffic on the freeway off ramp that I exit the freeway on every morning. The off ramp ends with a stop sign before you can merge onto the main street, and the main street traffic has a traffic signal just before the off ramp so if that light is red there are no cars and everybody can exit the freeway off ramp, and when the light is green there are cars passing by and the off ramp gets backed up for a minute or two until the light turns red again. So it's common for the off ramp to be backed up for a minute or two and then immediately clear up.\n\n**[Here](http://i.imgur.com/0qcVpau.png) is a diagram.** The blue markings represent car drivers that are following the law. The red marking represents the car driver that committed the moving violation. The green markings represent the main street cross traffic that is present or clear depending on the traffic light just off screen. And the yellow markings are just the cross traffic on the other side of the off ramp. \n\n**Moving Violation Description:** So while all the blue cars are stopped and backed up around the curve of the off ramp, one car pulls out from the line of stopped cars and drives around the side of the off ramp next to all the cars, thereby enabling he or she to merge onto the main street (green) traffic without waiting like the rest of us. The off ramp is wide enough to do this without problem; it is a very wide ramp, but there is no question that it is a single lane. It would be damn near impossible to mistake it for two lanes. \n\nNow, the blue cars were all stopped because the green cars had oncoming cross traffic. But right when the red car pulled out to jump the line, the green car traffic eased up. Both the red car and the first blue car in line pulled onto the main street at the same time... it being a two lane street so they each pulled into a different lane. The remaining blue cars all pulled onto the main street one by one after that.\n\nWhile witnessing this, I was initially upset for a couple of minutes. I wanted to honk and flip him or her off. (I did not.) But upon thinking about it there really isn't any reason for me to be angry about this.\n\n**Reasons this shouldn't make me angry:**\n\n* Nobody was in danger -- There are absolutely no pedestrians around the area. The red car driver did stop before merging, and only pulled onto the main street once it was clear and safe to do so. The blue cars weren't in danger of being side swiped by the red car as the lane was so wide. **(Edit [7hrs after posting]: I realized something that counters this point of mine and just for fun I'll tell you all.... the red car was blocking the blue car's view of oncoming traffic! That certainly makes it less safe.)**\n\n* Nobody got delayed because of it -- All the blue cars were able to merge onto the main street at the same pace they would have if the red car didn't commit this violation. The main street is two lanes, so the red car just took a wide turn into the far lane, so none of the blue cars had to wait for the red car and the red car didn't jump ahead of any of the blue cars.\n\n* Yes, he or she did break a rule, but so? -- I'm not the type to cling rigidly to rules and be upset about people breaking a rule simply because they broke a rule and defied authority. I'm one of those who generally thinks it's okay to break a rule if nobody is harmed. I don't cling to conventions and rules just for the sake of conventions and rules, so that in conjunction with my other two points above should make me not upset by this driver's actions.\n\n* Witnessing a person this impatient and frustrated is uncomfortable, but not reason to be angry -- I did realize while thinking about this that one of the reasons it causes such palpable emotions is because what the truth of what I actually witnessed here besides \"driver commits moving violation\" is \"driver becomes so impatient and frustrated that he or she manifests that frustration into action.\" And it is uncomfortable and perhaps even a little scary to witness a person become so upset that they perform actions out of frustration and impatience. But that would be reason for me to feel uncomfortable or scared, not angry. I felt angry. I wanted to honk and flip him off, not run to safety or get away from him. I was angry, not scared.\n\nSo, despite the fact that I was angry upon witnessing this, I contend now that there was no justifiable reason for me to be angry... was there?

CMV. + \n + PETA is one of the most universally derided groups out there, but I respect the integrity, consistency and ethical basis of their philosophy (which, at its core, is about anti-[speciesism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciesism)).  While I am not personally vegan, this is because: (i) I am an unethical person who sometimes prioritizes mild increases in my own comfort/pleasure over the extreme suffering of other sentient creatures; and (ii) knowing that my individual actions are a mere drop in a large bucket, I also do not vote.  But while I personally am a selfish asshole, I still understand rational ethics and prevailing concepts of empathy/morality, and therefore feel qualified to opine on whether actions are \"right\" or \"wrong\" as those terms are typically defined.  If you purport to *not* be an asshole but, rather, a fair and ethical person, then the anti-speciesist view that drives PETA is difficult or impossible to refute.  PETA's positions are consistent with that view. \n\nThe two most common criticisms directed at PETA are:\n\n* **PETA kills animals.**   PETA are utilitarians -- they basically examine the expected quality of an animal's life (much like the economic concept of expected value), and if that value is negative, they euthanize.  This means that even if there is only a 15% probability that an animal will be left unadopted (or adopted by a shitty owner) and will suffer tremendously, the negative expected value of that outcome can outweigh a larger probability of a moderately contented life.  Nobody joins PETA because they like the idea of ending animals' lives; however, anyone who has argued for assisted suicide or euthanasia in humans (which PETA's philosophical forebear, Peter Singer, also supports) should understand that a rational, dispassionate approach to death can be the most compassionate  approach overall. \n\n*  **PETA's publicity stunts are sensationalist, counterproductive and/or offensive.**  Here we're talking about campaigns that compare factory farming to the Holocaust, etc.  Through the lens of anti-speciesism, these comparisons are entirely valid.  I'll concede that from a tactical point of view, these campaigns may be poorly designed, because they offend the sensibilities of irrational stubborn people.  But I still agree with the message embodied.  \n\nIn most arguments where PETA is involved, I think that generally speaking PETA is correct.  CMV if you can.  "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

This is an absurd system.\n\nThe old rationale for having a degree as a prerequisite for being able to do a job well was that that person has acquired some specialized knowledge that isn't available to other people.  This rationale has been significantly eroded by the advent of the Internet.  \n\nAnd even if someone does have specialized knowledge, why would we want to reward the people who hoard knowledge instead of sharing?  Because if they aren't sharing knowledge, then they aren't looking out for the best interests of the nation/community anyway, so they have no business being in a position of privilege/power.\n\nFrom a 2010 Time [article](http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1967580,00.html):\n\n\"It is absurd that people have to get college degrees to be considered for good jobs in hotel management or accounting \u2014 or journalism. It is inefficient, both because it wastes a lot of money and because it locks people who would have done good work out of some jobs. The tight connection between college degrees and economic success may be a nearly unquestioned part of our social order. Future generations may look back and shudder at the cruelty of it.\"\n\nBecause people need specific degrees in order to get good jobs, everyone is locked into educational arms races against one another.  \n\nSo before, a high school degree was enough to get you a job that paid a livable wage, then it was a bachelor's, and now it's a master's or professional degree.\n\nConsider the possibility that in the digital age, formal education has little or no value added in terms of capability and is really just a signalling mechanism for intelligence or drive or money at a particular time in a person's life.  \n\nAnd consider that that is a tremendous waste of human life and potential, because instead of competing against one another for educational credentials, \"students\" could be living, working in, and serving society with education as a byproduct of that.  \n\nInstead of divorcing \"education\" and \"life,\" we should treat young people and non-degreed people as full members of the nation/community who would be capable of doing what people with degrees can do if they were allowed.  Education should be a natural part of living, and not something that takes place only in some industrialized factory schools.\n\nWith that view, I think we might start looking after students and paying them to go to school like in other countries, instead of having them take out ridiculous non-dischargeable student loans just because they want to educate themselves.\n\nThe only criterion for whether a person should be allowed to do a job or not is whether they can do the job well or learn to do the job well, and degrees/qualifications are a terribly inefficient measure of whether that is the case.\n\nSuppose in school you had to do a book report on To Kill a Mockingbird, but you were only allowed to turn in the report if you bought a particular brand or printing of the book.  You read the book, you wrote the report, but you didn't buy the particular edition of the book, so you're not allowed to turn it in.  That is basically the system we have now, because if your education isn't *formal* education, then it doesn't count.\n\nWe should outlaw discriminating against people without degrees as a screening mechanism for employment, just like we outlaw discrimination on the basis of race or gender. \n\nA sane educational/employment system would look more like this:\n\nThe only qualification anyone should ever need is their ability to do the job well, which they should be able to prove through\n\n1. Exams and performance tests, not necessarily just written\n2. Apprenticeships/trial periods\n3. Any other method that tests for competence rather than expense\n\nOur capabilities aren't fixed, reality is inherently \"interdisciplinary,\" and requiring people to obtain particular brands of education instead of allowing them to get it from anywhere and be evaluated on their merits is an absurd feature of our economic/educational system.\n\nI don't think we can be called a successful or advanced nation until we've learned to cooperate and look out for another instead of being in vicious competition.  We're a supposedly advanced nation/society, but we end up wasting our lives in various educational arms races and rat races instead of living in cooperation and harmony, and our degree system promotes exclusivity and elitism that very much contributes to that dynamic.  \n\nMaybe it was once idealistic to have a 40 hour workweek or a weekend, but people banded together and fought for them, and now we look back and see that having a system that accepted abusing workers to that extent was harmful to everyone.  Likewise, we should fight to get rid of our abusive degree system so that we and future generations can have better lives.  CMV!"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Based on the fact that we used to be cave men and women and men would typically have multiple partners in order to pass their lineage on, I believe that while we have clearly evolved from that, biology has still framed us to struggle with monogamy. In many ways, I think we have animalistic tendencies when it comes to interpersonal relationships and that people will always struggle with looking for someone better because of natural selection and all that jazz. Also, testosterone is a powerful thing.\n\nMarriage, for example, is a social construct and legal contract more than anything. And, whether married or not, failed relationships and cheating is just way too prevalent to be coincidental. I think our bodies struggle with remaining loyal to one person, even if we are emotionally complex enough to realize that this is wrong.\n\nWhile, from an idealistic stance, I think it's awesome to think we could find one partner who is \"the one,\" and successfully remain with them indefinitely, I have a hard time believing that is indeed the case.

CMV + \n + Historically, human population growth went along with increases in food production and the switch from subsistence farming to larger scale farming and eventually industrial farming. \n\nThese increases in food production were made possible by a string of innovations and increases in productivity through technological and methodological advances in farming, like crop rotation, better plowing tools, use of animal labour, use of manure as fertilizer, breeding of crops and livestock, chemically produced fertilizers and pesticides, and, as of late, genetic modification of crops.\n\nToday is the first time in recorded history that we deliberately use farming methods that decrease output under the moniker of organic food production. \n\nI believe that the desire for organic food production is a symptom of rich and saturated societies, and is what we here know as a \"first world problem\". This desire has the potential to compromise the global food output if it becomes more wide-spread and increase the number of people living in hunger and dying from starvation.\n\nI don't contest that chemically produced fertilizers and pesticides and GMO crops must be used carefully and in measured amounts to get the risk/benefit balance right, and yes, there are risks, hazards and dangers associated with them. I don't contest either, that early pesticides were rather poisonous and at times did more harm than good, especially when used naively.\n\nHowever, science and engineering progress all the time, pesticides become better, more specific, fertilizers become better to handle, cheaper and less energy-intensive to produce, GMO crops continue what breeding programs have done in the past, that is improve a plant species for more and potentially healthier output with equal production cost.\n\nAnd thus, I believe that organic food production is a dangerous fad, and that to increase food output and eradicate hunger and malnutriton we must use and improve industrial farming methods, using and improving all means available to us intelligently and wisely and without the prejudice of labelling something that came out of a chemical plant as \"bad\" while labelling something that came out of a cow's arse as somehow magically \"good\", and instead have a sane cost/benefit analysis that takes into account all that is availabe to us.\n\nQuite simply, we must not throw away much of the food production techniques what served us well the last couple of hundred years because that could kill a large portion of humans alive today.\n\nChange my view."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

As a society we have given up too many personal rights on all fronts and are worse off for it. I break my view down into two issues:\n\n**Too Many Regulations:** There is a balance point that needs to be struck between \"do whatever you want\" and \"you have no rights\". We have tilted far too close to the latter. Often such new regulations are the result of fear mongering or pandering to single issue voting blocks. The results are the proliferation of thousands of petty laws. Think for example of the byzantine web of gun laws that are based on silly cosmetic features that have nothing to do with the guns effectiveness. Or another thread on the CMV front page about traffic violations for putting on chapstick or taking a sip from a water bottle while driving. \n\nI am not against sensible regulations to curb huge dangers but these laws provide either no increase in safety or one that is statistically insignificant. This kind of bullshit also causes a much bigger problem which is...\n\n**Over-Criminalization:** I am of the view that no one ever got caught up in the criminal law system that turned out the better for it. The criminal courts should be reserved as a last resort tool to deal with serious violations of property or persons. The issues of incarceration in America and our legal systems dysfunction are infamous so I wont rehash that here.\n\nThe creation of so many conflicting, complicated, and petty laws creates a situation where legal regulations no longer follow a common sense model that an average person can follow. It has been said all of us break probably a dozen laws without knowing it every day. This degrades trust between the authorities and the citizens, as well as between the citizens themselves.\n\n**Conclusion:** While the motivation to -do something- about the loss of a loved one in accident or seek legal recourse for minor annoyances is strong there also must be limits. The creation of an endless legal miasma about every action in life makes a society worse off. CMV if you can.\n "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Darth Vader is also guilty of this, routinely killing Imperial officers. So does the Joker in the Dark Knight, and this actually almost goes wrong for him. \n\nAll three of these examples represent slightly different reasons for killing your henchmen, but I think each one is poor form. In the case of the Ninja Turtles villain, actions like that engender dissent and create a culture of fear and paranoia among your henchmen. I mean those guys just had to hold down their coworker and watch him die, how do they know it's not going to be them next time? If anything would inspire me to quit or revolt, that would definitely be up there.\n\nIn the case of Darth Vader, he kills Imperial officers for failing him, which stifles creativity and likely costs him a lot of high quality officers. The Empire is fighting an insurgency and as recent events in Afghanistan showed, mistakes are going to be made, and it's difficult work. I suspect that the reason Vader is constantly saddled with incompetent officers is that he killed all the competent ones long ago and now no one wants to work with him. Also the Empire clearly doesn't promote based on merit, because Vader immediately promotes a guy after the first time we see him kill someone, and that guy sucked just as much.\n\nIn the case of the Joker, his plan almost backfires as it's happening. You think when the Joker gets back to his Joker-Cave none of his countless other henchmen are going to be like \"Hey, where's Vinny and Don and Jake? Didn't they go to rob that bank with you?\" The Joker treats all of his henchmen as completely disposable and useless, which is likely how he sees them, but that's bad for morale. It's not like there's a shortage of villains hiring random thugs for stuff in Gotham. Go seek a job where your employer isn't a constant source of danger.\n\nMachiavelli said that if you can't be loved and feared, it's better to be feared, but he touted Cesare Borgia as a great leader, and that guy died naked and alone of a stab wound. The only case where I think killing your henchmen makes sense is shooting deserters in the middle of a pitched battle, as that encourages continued fighting in the moment over desertion in an \"over the top\" kinda situation. Otherwise it's bad for business and lowers morale. There are better ways to handle all these situations."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I'm saying that they aren't taught, and can't be asked to understand the depth or breadth of the issues at hand. I'm not saying they are incapable of a basic concept of grief or strife. They could surely understand sorrow. But to grasp the complex legal and social ramifications of pledging themselves to a nation as large as America... is ridiculous.

I'm an atheist, I believe in evolution and all that jazz. However, I don't believe in science's ability to provide capital-T definite Truths, only small-t truths (or what I consider to be tentative truths), which are marred by social influences, human blindness and methodological flaws. I believe there is, to some degree, a scientism to be wary of when considering questions of what we know, and do not accept anything just because it is stated to be \"science\", but based on a pragmatic assessment of the work's epistemological value (which I recognize, of course, to be built upon my own premises, as I am not a perfect arbiter of truth either, and ultimately requires a lot of research in order to fully understand what is being presented to me) in order to determine on a personal basis how believable the evidence is, though, of course, it is never perfect.\n\nThe reason I do this is because I think that taking science as authority in itself is a flawed premise to come from, and that the questioning of science is more in line with scientific principle than not. Firstly due to the fact that science relies on a succession of paradigms (in the Kuhnian sense), but also because too often I see people purport scientific claims that are ill-founded and based on unreasonable grounds. Further, I see a danger in entrusting science without due consideration, scientists being within a social frame, to make accurate determinations without bias necessarily, be it political in nature (such as the old scientific racism or modern day neurosexism) or just by chasing the random whims of their mind's eye (I see string theory like this often, if only because it doesn't even meet Popperian requirements of falsification, at least not yet). However, often I run into people who bawk at the questioning of a reified Science in any capacity, and am confused for the sort of person who may be a climate change denialist or an intelligent design advocate.\n\nAn aside: do not confuse this for blind acceptance of non-scientific things.

They might be referred to as \"survivors\" if their lives legitimately came into jeopardy (if they were held at gunpoint, if they were severely physically assaulted, etc.), but most instances of rape (unwanted sexual advances isolated to a single instance) do not come attached with a serious possibility of death. Rape is definitely one of the worst things that can happen to somebody, but I think that \"survivor\" suggests that what happened to them was on the same level as living through a genocidal campaign, a terminal illness, a plane crash, or something else of the sort. The former is bad, but the latter are almost certainly worse. Rape victims calling themselves \"survivors\" takes attention away from more serious issues in which death is on the line. Again, rape is a very serious issue, but not as serious as issues that consistently result in death."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It stifles conversation and creates both a sounding board for popular views and a hostile environment for unpopular or even new views. + \n + First, I recognize the irony that downvoting this CMV would be tacitly agreeing with my argument. \n\nOk, to begin, I recognize there is definitely a good use for the downvote button - when people spam or write racial remarks, etc - a low score hides the comment / it eventually gets deleted by mods. \n\nHowever, this could be fixed by a simple 'mark as spam/offensive' button that once received enough hits, would also be deleted.\n\nNow, on to the main point:  There's no need for a downvote button.  Don't agree, think the point's uninteresting, then leave it alone - or better yet, respond as to why it's not a good point.   \"this has been discredited - see here\" or \"this has been asked before - see here\"\n\n The psychological problem is that new knowledge is threatening and people use the downvote button as an easy way of showing their disagreement without actually thinking about it.\n\n\nFurther, The problem with a downvote is that interesting but controversial points get low scores, when they really should be getting some of the highest ones. \n\nConsider an example where you have 3 possible comments.\n\n1) A good comment where everyone agrees\n\n2) A bad comment where everyone agrees\n\n3) A good comment where most people disagree.\n\nLet's imagine 100 people voting:  with the current system, the first comment will get the most (high upvotes, low downvotes).  The second will get the second (few upvotes, but fewer downvotes).  The third will get the worst score (some upvotes - more than #2, but many downvotes).  \n\nGiven by how most people read reddit (and the psychological tendency for people to be influenced by what's popular) - these good, but new ideas will be ignored.\n\nNow you may say: Just sort by controversial.  While, I typically do - the problem is that the second type (bad but popular comments) also get stuck in the mix.  \n\nLastly, early downvotes cause even larger problems.  [First, an early downvote to a link, virtually erases a thread](http://technotes.iangreenleaf.com/posts/2013-12-09-reddits-empire-is-built-on-a-flawed-algorithm.html). In conjuction, as alluded people are more likely to downvote things that already have downvotes (and upvotes).  Try it - the next few times you post something, make a new account and either upvote it or downvote it and see how well it does.  Although, erasing the downvote doesn't get rid of this problem entirely it helps.\n\nUltimately - my view is that, although not the initial intention, the downvote serves as an implicit \"I don't agree with this, but I don't feel like thinking about it, or explaining to the person why, so I'll just hit this button.\"  Doing so keeps dissenting views and novel questions out of reddit, or at the very best - leaves people with the hanging question of why their thoughts are wrong."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Trials seeking the death penalty often cost anywhere from four to ten times the amount than a trial that does not seek the death penalty (and results in life imprisonment instead), and the taxpayers are held responsible for these costs. States that have abolished the death penalty are able to use these funds to support local police, fire departments, schools, etc. instead of deciding whether or not a crime is punishable by death. \nI have seen arguments stating that the death penalty serves as a deterrent for the heinous crimes punishable by death, but this is simply not the case. According to the FBI crime reports, the Southern United States has the highest average murder rates, even though 80% of executions take place there. While the northeast, which accounts for less than 1% of all executions, had the lowest murder rates.\n In regards to the rest of the world, the UN secretary general, has called on member states that still use the death penalty to abolish this practice, stressing that the right to life lies at the heart of international human rights. I believe this is the case, despite how terrible the crime is. It isn\u2019t like they won\u2019t be spending the rest of their lives in a monotonous routine behind bars anyways.

In most other cases, when the situation becomes a he-said she-said argument, one side would need to provide some sort of proof in order to have the law side with them. \n\nI understand that this is a complex issue, and that the incidence and frequency of rape is a cause for concern. I understand that in many ways, the current system is incapable of dealing appropriately with rape, as a majority of rapes are not reported and many rapists get away scot free. \n\nHowever, that does not at all mean that it's okay for an allegation alone to carry any more weight than usual. Ultimately, the story one tells is just a story, and without verification from other sources, there's no way to gauge its accuracy. Everybody lies, and just because an anecdote is convincingly given and you believe someone's account of a situation does not mean that their testimony is accurate. Anecdotal evidence in any other field is given little to no weight, and it shouldn't in cases of rape as well. \n\nYes, the system sucks. But the solution isn't to allow indiscriminate accusation to hold weight- it's to figure out some way by which stronger evidence can be obtained to discern the actual course of events. Without more evidence, it's unreasonable to expect prosecution to occur differently. "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

They created philosophy and advanced math science and music. However, they still had religion. Because of this they never searched for the true reasons of stuff, ie: earthquakes, lightning, etc. They just used a higher power to justify it. If they hadn't had religion, and they had gone looking for the true reason behind  things, they probably could have advanced so much more. Combine that with the Roman Empire and there is potential for there to have never been any dark ages or medieval plagues. With those people working on advancing sciences and not working on staying alive and killing heretics, we could have gotten even more advanced. Humans could be so much more advanced in the 21st century if it wasn't for religions. \n\nFurthermore religion has in total done more harm than good. Yes, it has made people do small kind deeds, but it has also been used in the name of war, killing heretics (which caused the murder of \"witches\"), the corruptions of the Holy Catholic Church, the crusades that killed loads, the religious wars that killed many, the human sacrifices of the incas or Mayans (Can't remember which group it was specifically), the use of it to endorse slavery, the use of it to endorse the holocaust, and even the current day us of it to generate hate against our own man (gays, etc).

Try and CMV. + \n + Backstory: Okay, so I was watching the Oprah network the other day and Kym Whitley (a D list celebrity with another one of these family reality shows), was going through an experience where he adopted son's birth mother called and wanted to see him. [Please follow this link, scroll down about 1/3 of the page and watch the video](http://www.oprah.com/own-raising-whitley/Preview-Should-Joshua-Meet-his-Birthmother-Video). All her friends were against it.  They said you are the real mom and you don't want to confuse Joshua with another mom. She didn't want the birth mom to have any contact because she was afraid that Joshua might one day say 'you're not my mom'. \n\nI don't think introducing another his birth mom is going to confuse him or damage him in anyway. I think the only reason adoptive parents want to distance the kids from the birth parents is for selfish reasons. They said, \"she carried him for 9 months, but you're actually raising him.\" So why should she see him... She doesn't want Joshua to say \"you're not my mom\" or even feel it, but that's Kim Whitley's problem and hers alone. It's not Joshua's. She said \"if Joshua at age 18 wants to find his birth parents, that's on him.\"  Why 18? Why not 14 or 10 or 2?\n\nSome people give up their babies into open adoptions where they get pictures and updates, but then adoptive parents close the adoptions, meaning they move and cut off all contact with birth parents. If kids want to find their birth parents they have to go looking. \nI think it's selfish. It's because they want to raise their baby without another set of parents butting in. The other set of parents isn't going to damage your child in any way. They just feel threatened that the child may want some type of connection or relationship with birth parents at some point, and that may usurp their position as parent. "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The Arab Spring, Euromaiden, and the Brazilian protests, to name a few.

I have lost faith that the American people will ever fight against the government to defend our freedoms, like those who took part in the aforementioned protests did.\n\nI'm not saying that there needs to be a violent revolt in America. All I'm saying is that the American people would never rise up in a mass protest and defend their rights and freedoms. People seem to take freedom for granted, and let the government get away with suppressing basic rights because they believe the government would never do anything to hurt the American people.\n\nI know this post is all over the place, but I found my view hard to put into words.\n\ntl;dr: The American people take freedom for granted, and would never rise up in protest against the American government, even when their rights are infringed upon.\n\nCMV."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It started with Buzzfeed, but has even spread to [HuffPo.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/05/dont-ask-brides-this-please_n_6801976.html) Not that HuffPo is the most respected news source anymore, but it's certainly not a Buzzfeed time-killing list site. It *is* a news site, respected or not. \n\nSo now even news sites are stealing Reddit content, and not properly citing it back to Reddit. The Huff Po example only links back to the main thread asked on Reddit, not to the individual answers that they directly quote. And the authors of the individual comments that were directly quoted were never informed about their quotes being used in the article. I actually started a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/2y2jmj/huffington_post_stole_comments_from_this/) about it in the original subreddit that the article content was stolen from, and the original comment authors replied to the new thread stating this article was surprise and they were never contacted for permission.\n\nI know this is all actually legal because Reddit is a public forum.

Ranting non-stop about the failure of austerity in Britain and elsewhere doesn't justify the argument for increased stimulus spending as a general policy. Uncompetitive economies which don't have the exorbitant privilege of controlling the world's reserve currency can't engage in Quantitative Easing or other money printing shenanigans without risking massive inflation and sharp increases in interest rates.  \n\nFor the US in particular, I find contemporary liberal thinking regarding economic policy to be severely misguided. Rising costs associated with means-tested welfare programs, Medicare/Medicaid, Social Security, are rising at unsustainable levels which cannot be mitigated through military cuts or increased tax revenue. Deep cuts to entitlements are necessary.\n\nOn the tax issue, I really don't understand people's support for higher *income* taxes for the top brackets. The rates for &gt;$193000 combined household income are most painful for educated professionals while hardly affecting the 'truly rich'. The rich make the majority of their their money though investment. Why do liberals never advocate for higher capital gains tax or higher estate taxes? Do they hate doctors/engineers more than they hate fund managers and their clients?\n\nOnto matters of stimulus and spending. The vast majority of the American workforce has been uncompetitive for the past 20 years and yet, hasn't experienced a significant decrease in quality of life. The first reason is globalized cheap labor allowing for multinationals to cut overhead and subsidize US costs of living. The second reason is deficit spending to support state/federal wages and social programs. The US can afford to run this deficit a lot longer than other countries with the dollar as the reserve currency and the US being the lender of last resort. That combined with current uncertainty in the world economy allows for the US to commit atrocities such as TARP, QEternity, and debt monetization without risk of inflation or rising interest rates...for now. \n\nThe fundamental problem is the fact that vast swathes of the US are no different from Greece. To say nothing about subsidized government jobs, there is no demographic more unproductive/uncompetitive than inner-city urban populations which are growing faster relative to every other demographic save for unskilled hispanic immigrants. These systemic problems can't be solved stimulus of any kind. Massive investment in infrastructure is good in theory, but construction would most likely be slow and hindered by prohibitive labor costs while finished projects might not even derive much utility. \n\nThe US can probably maintain its current trajectory for another decade before the rest of the world leaves the dollar. The US can do what they did to Japan in the 80s and what Japan is doing now and continue to devalue its currency, but this eats away at household savings and income; the former already depleted and the latter having already stagnated for decades. \n\nIt seems abundantly clear that the US is running out of borrowed time. Severe economic pain and rebalancing will occur and there does not exist a policy which will prevent it, only one that will slightly lessen it. Conservatives have stumbled across the right policy, but are mistaken if they expect significant economic growth. Even with housing inventory depleted, growth will probably remain &lt;3% and unlikely to benefit most of the population. It's better to face the pain while the country still has the option to. \n\nCMV - I'm not an expert.\n\n "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

These threads generally include a story or two about a guy that decided to show up to work in a skirt and was made fun of, or sent home to change.\n\nI think that having a \"Dress Up for Work\" day would help move the needle on this issue.  Having a day where a large number of men go to work in skirts or dresses would have a number of advantages, I think.  First, it wouldn't just be one individual who feels isolated in his workplace.  Even if a particular guy is the only one doing it in his office, he'll know that other guys in other offices are doing it, too.  Second, having it be a specific day will allow men to talk to their bosses about it ahead of time, and might generate some media that will help alert people in general.  I think just showing up suddenly in a completely different mode of dress is what causes some of the disruption that makes managers crack down on men wearing skirts.  Being prepared for it would help make it more of a regular day at the office.  If I wanted to start wearing a headscarf to work, I would probably tell people ahead of time, so that it's not a big deal when I do start dressing in a completely different way.  Finally, it would allow men the time to review their company's dress code and plan for the day.  I imagine it would take more shopping for the average guy who has never worn a skirt to find one that suits him.  Having a movement instead of just doing it on their own would allow guys to give each other feedback on what they have found that works, or maybe even create garments that are more flattering for the male anatomy.  This would also lead to more acceptance because a piece of clothing that fits well and is flattering to the wearer's body type is less noticeable than ill-fitting and unflattering clothing.\n\nOver all, I think that enough men want to be able to wear skirts that it would have momentum, and showing that there are a large number of people who support the idea would increase the pace at which it is generally accepted."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

This is even better for hair which supposedly is damaged by too much cleaning. \n\nMaybe some of you may argue that it helps you feel awake in the mornings, but that's not a very good reason, is it?\n\nMore than changing my view, i'm interested in knowing if there are decent reasons to justify daily showering for people who don't get very dirty or sweat a whole lot everyday for some reason. But of course if there's a really good argument i can definitely change my view. "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

CMV + \n + I have seen so many people who have adopted a dog for $100 from shelters.  They can never fathom spending over $1000 for a dog from a breeder and also get the justified satisfaction of 'saving a life'.  There are occasions where they adopt a wonderful dog that is behaved and brings them lots of love and that is great...  But more often than not I find these rescued dogs are a bad choice.\n\nA lot of these dogs are inbred, have bad genetics, issues from being abandoned, or are just stupid.  You take a gamble when you get a 'cheap dog' from the pound and unless you are a heartless bastard who would abandon your pet, you are now stuck with a problem dog.  I find this especially important when it comes to their intelligence and health.  Too many I have seen that are terrified of their own shadow and avoid visitors like the plague.  They freak out at sounds and are hard if not impossible to train well.\n\nPeople get these cheap dogs and ridicule people who researched a breeder and spent a premium to get a dog with a good pedigree.  Yet years down the line when their loved one has all these health issues, it is costing them far more money in the long term to take care of their pet.  Spend $1000 on a dog that is not inbred, has good health history through their parents, and is shown to be more intelligent.  You won't be spending as much to treat health problems down the road which will far surpass the $900 extra you spent on your dog.\n\nYes I feel depressed when I think about poor shelter animals who will be terminated in a short time...  But if you are going to have a pet you love for 12-16 years...  I believe it is a bad idea to take a risk on an unknown dog.\n\nChange my view."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The media is bombarding us on a daily basis with news of atrocities carried out in the name of Islam...\n\nMy point is: Statistically, you are probably a citizen of a country whose govt has been supporting oil rigging/child labor/despotic regimes in south america/africa/asia with very poor environmental/ethical/moral standards.... The environment suffers greatly as well as tens of thousands of people die / get sick/ lead shitty lives because of it. Have you taken time off from your job, wife/ husband and kids to show your disapproval of whats done in your name, with your tax dollars?  \n\nYes ISIS is pure garbage, maybe if a local protest was organized id go.... maybe not... but why burden this high standard/responsibility on a billion people when we don't hold the same standard ourselves? \n\nFrom my personal perspective: Canada is responsible for awful human/environmental tragedies overseas related to mine exploitation. .. i think it would be unfair for me to hold all my fellow Canadians in shame because not enough of them protested against it.\n\nLikewise, it would be unfair to negatively view/judge all Muslims because my personal standard of what should be enough outrage, is not exhibited.\n\n\nHere is another good one:\nInvasion of Iraq 2003, the whole world (almost literally) thought it was an awful idea, was unjustified and would only result in a bad outcome (ISIS!?)  Should we collectively scorn all Americans citizens and their whole political system for this action, or blame the bad apples that used the US system, rhetoric, laws,  to pursue their ownpersonal, selfish goals?\n\nLink:\nhttp://www.amnesty.ca/category/issue/business-and-human-rights/mining-and-indigenous-rights-in-guatemala\n\nI find a good way to be as objective/unbiased as possible in life is to imagine the same situation but with different people/groups/variables in it.\n\nWith this in mind:\n\nU/RibsnGibs explains my point way more simply/logically:**\n\nPut more simply: if Person A belongs to group X, and if group X does something person A doesn't like, person A should protest. This covers why an American (person A) might protest if the US (group X) does something bad.\n\nBut if person A who happens to have belief B, and group X also claims to have belief B, I don't think there's any expectation for person A to protest if group X does anything bad. This is why I don't think it should be expected that random Muslim guy A should have any more interest than any other person that ISIS (group X) happens to do something wrong simply because they both claim to have the same Islamic faith.\n\n** Another example would be if we expect random Christian guy Joe to have any more interest than a Jewish or Atheist or Muslim guy if an extremist Christian group bombs an abortion clinic. Christian guy Joe doesn't belong to the group that blew up the abortion clinic - they just both claim to be Christian. **"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I consider myself to be a sensitive kind of guy and would hate to upset anyone. I am open minded so I would love to hear your thoughts on this subject. \n\nMy current view on homosexuals is as follows. Homosexuallity has its place in modern society. I could careless if someone is gay or if they get married. We are all entitled to our own way of life and should be able to live it anyway we please, after all it's happiness we are all after. I DO have a problem with the \"we are born this way\" or \"god made me gay\" arguments. My feeling is that this is not even close to being true. I believe it is strictly the environment you grow up in that moves you to swing to the homosexual side. Certain events happen that trigger emotion for the opposite sex. Emotion that resides in all of us, but without the environmental pressure most of us will never venture to the homosexual side. You don't have to look far to find gay people. With the way society is today, gay people are more prevalent than ever before. The most common sense of the reason why would be because it's more socially acceptable than ever before. But why? It isn't part of nature's ways. A species wouldn't be created and not be able to breed. It is only natural instinct for males to try and get the attention of females for the sole purpose of reproduction. The human race couldn't survive without it.\n\n Now having said that I do believe homosexual experimentation is normal. Humans are naturally curious and love to explore. I don't believe it to be natural for it to be anything but an experiment. I think it's also in human nature to want to be loved and have attention. I think that's where homosexuallity starts. I feel that there is such a desire for people wanting to be loved and so much pressure from society telling you you need to be loved and have a lover that ultimately people are forced into homosexual relationships. Imagine yourself as a young man. You're somewhat attractive, caring and a nice sensitive guy. Being sort of submissive quiet type you don't really get noticed too much by woman. Feeling the desire to be loved and receive attention from someone on a emotional\\physical level, you start exploring new ways to achieve that attention. Who else is going to give you that attention if women aren't giving you the time of day? Other men in your position. Being eager to share emotional bond with each other things move fast. It may not last but your first experiment with another man has proven to be positive in your seek for affection. So now loving your new found attention and still receiving none from the opposite sex it's only logical to keep seeking the same attention. \n\nSo you come out and tell everyone you're gay. This only helps you because word usually gets around and other gay men will be attracted curious or at least look. I believe part of the reason gay people lose interest in the opposite in sex is partly due to the fact both parties of the same sex are looking for a lot of affection and emotion\\physical connection. Whereas going back to the opposite sex, the desire for the same amount of connection isn't as great or isn't received do to our vast differences.. Therefore it is hard to feel as satisfied by the opposite sex. Now as I said before, I'm a sensitive caring guy myself. I do have a hard time myself getting affection and filling my desire to be loved with woman.\n\n I receive more interest from gay guys than woman. Do to my somewhat submissive behaviour I'm often called gay. I however have experienced being satisfied by a woman both emotionally and physically. I know what that feels like and I have a desire to have that connection. I must admit it is very tempting to receive the almost guaranteed attention from the same sex. We all just want to be loved. Now more on the environmental factors that determines a gay person.\n\n Here is another scenario. You grow up with 2 fathers. Whether is be donated sperm or adoption. With that child growing up with predominate homosexual parents what is that child going to know about hetosexual relationships? Basically nothing besides what is learned from other social interaction. That child is more likely to grow up and become gay itself if not at least open to the idea of being gay, unless impacted by the environment in which they are raised. Their friends have a big impact on who they become.  Now in a traditional family a child is less likely to become gay. There is more pressure from the family to become straight and the majority of society is straight.\n\n No person comes out of the womb flamboyant. It is most certainly self taught. It is usually for attention whether it be to attract fellow gay people or simply to get noticed. Again it's the easiest way to get noticed and receive the affection and attention humans desire. A lot of gay people go out of their way to make it known to everyone that they are gay. Because they desire more attention than the opposite sex it able to give (Even if they don't know it's the reason why they are attracted to the same sex). So basically you weren't born gay. Certain things happened in your life that makes you turn to being gay. I find it probably happens to guys, like me, more often than not. Submissive unnoticed guys that have a desire to be loved, but no one to love them. No one to bring up their confidence and make them feel valuable. People feeling the same void will attract each other. In today's society it feels more acceptable to be gay and I believe some people are for that attention and to feel like they are part of something. Gives their lives meaning if they are standing for something, I kind of feel the same goes for today's feminist.\n\nNow if you are gay I want you to love yourself and love each other. You've been through some hardships that straight people will never understand. You as a group have fought a great deal for your rights that you should have had all along. To be casted out by religions isn't fair either. For the life of me I can't find in my religion where it says to hate gays. I can find love one another though. \n\nplease reddit change my view. \n\n\nI will be dense a little ignorant because if your counter argument isn't strong enough it won't help me change my mind\n\n* I do not think being gay is always a choice. I believe social environment and life events play a role\n \n* I agree some genetics play a role, but not ones that directly affect sexual orientation \n\n* Animals have shown homosexual behavior, but so have straight men and woman\n\n* I have not found any scientific data that clearly states being gay is genetic. (most don't if read entirely)\n\n* percentage of gay people from now and the past can not be accurately calculated. We don't know and never will know how many people were gay are really gay and who isn't really gay."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

This **does not** mean how the *group* as whole is better off, I'm only concerned with the *individual*. \n\n**Why I think this:** Since health insurance is a **business** which is primarily focused on making money, I see no reason why has any responsibly to support it unless they choose to do so. Basically, I'm under no moral obligation to subsidize this industry because it exists only to make money.\n\n\n**Supplemental:** I keep hearing on NPR how there is concern that not enough young and healthy people are buying health insurance. This does seem like a problem since the economics of insurance rely on more people paying into it than are using the services. From the insurance industry's perspective, it is a huge problem if too many sick and old people compared to healthy and young are insured because it basically causes the whole system to collapse. I understand the economics behind it, however, that doesn't mean it is in the individual's best interest to support this system. \n\nI feel that it might be important to add that I'm not one of these individuals who doesn't need insurance. I'm young, but I have a chronic condition and so I need health insurance. Also, I personally think healthcare should be somewhat like the security industry: if you want/need you are allowed hire private security but everyone has access to police."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

[ (Not from the movie, but from here) ](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=sa7rmohv1hmgymf4xdu8cait&amp;page=27#660) It summed up my feelings about the movie quite well. Throughout human history, conquerors with superior technology have succeeded over less capable and less innovative cultures. It's ruthless, yes, but the reality is conquered cultures were less capable than the victors. Therefor it is in the best interest of cultures to strive for innovation, invention, progress, technology, and science. Not only does this secure survivability, but also increases standard of living.\n\nColonel Quaritch, as well as the other miners, were there to extract resources which benefited this endeavor. They were striving to better their abilities through use of the metal under the tree the Na'vi inhabited. \n\nArguably, Colonel Quaritch **COULD** have massacred the residents of Hometree. It was well within his ability and means. Instead, a chance to evacuate is given, and Quaritches forces **target Hometree itself, not the Na'vi** The fleet do not gun down the fleeing residents, nor do they pursue. Their goal was the resources under the tree, and not the extermination of the people.\n\n\nNext, Quaritch ceases hostilities against the Na'vi until Jake assembles a massive force around the headquarters. Quaritch **COULD** have met them in battle, but instead what does he do? Tries to avoid direct bloodshed by taking out a cultural symbol, thus potentially avoiding loss of life among both Na'vi and Human. \n\n\nThe culture of the Na'vi could have ended up like the Native Americans. Conquered, but preserved through merciful reservations granted by the victors. Instead they opted for resistance, and I'm interested to see what the sequel holds for them. In the mean time, I feel Colonel Quaritch's actions were rational, reasonable, justifiable, and the correct course of action. My friend disagreed, and I'm more than open for discussion to better understand the opposing view."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

No one should have to worry that their money is invested into a professor that can barely be understood.\n\nThis view sources from personal experiences, in which both my science and math professors were from India and China, respectively. The science professor spoke in a thick Indian accent, and we were put behind schedule because 60% of the time someone had to stop her to repeat what she had said. The math professor was a little worse; she didn't know how to say certain mathematical terms and her words were so distorted I wondered if she was even speaking English anymore. In fact, if I were to utilize my idea from the previous paragraph, the Indian one would be rated a 3 and the Chinese one a 1.\n\nOf course, I am speaking of only the United States and yes, I understand that we are a nation of immigrants. Hell, my parents are immigrants.

Now all these years later Israel is happy to give Palestine large segments of their own land on the condition of peace, while Palestine still wants nothing more than to destroy Israel. While I agree that it is only natural to want land back that was taken forcibly from you, it seems that supporters of Palestine don't understand that dissolving an entire nation and it's citizens for the sake of a historical grudge just can't happen in this modern world. Yes, it was terrible how the land was taken from them, but as so many others have pointed out - it was also terrible how the land was taken from the native Americans, yet surely everyone understands the issues that would arise if the entire continent was suddenly given back to native Americans. \n\nInstead, Palestine seems to be getting enormous support from much of the world in their plight to sacrifice millions of lives in this bid to reclaim what they feel is theirs. If the identity of an entire state's citizens is taken away from them, resulting in more violence and refugees so that Palestine gets some land back, so be it, right?\n\nI want to side with Palestine given the continually dire situation they are in, and the amount of oppression they are subjected to, but this is all created by a war that seems entirely motivated by their own people. Why is there so much support for Palestine given that they seem to be the warmongers? \n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I see D and R (democrats and republics, I will just shorten them to D and R) continuously arguing over topics that would not benefit the general public. Their reasons are often objectionable, and I do not see why we continue to use this party system. I do understand that it would be an absolutely HUGE undertaking to redo this system and I am not advocating for an immediate change. \n\nFor example: net neutrality. What the hell is going on here? From what I understand, we have ISP corporations paying government officials to pass laws or the such to benefit the ISP. (That, of which, is an entirely different discussion) So now we effectively have the ISPs vs the ones who didn't accept the money. What on earth? We didn't elect the ISPs. We elected representatives... People who are supposed to stand for the general public, not a couple corporations. Additionally - we all know Obama is pro neutrality. I have no opinion on Obama or his work. Maybe I will after he finishes this term. But I see people opposing net neutrality SOLELY because Obama is for it. What? You're willing to limit one of the greatest inventions for technological growth in the last century just because the other party doesn't want to limit it? You have no basis to your argument, its just that Obama is for it. And apparently he is never morally right ? How can voters trust your party if you just go against another persons beliefs just because of who they are? \n\nIf this whole ordeal repeatedly continues into other issues that we face in the future, what does this mean for the citizens? It would effectively be run by whoever has more people in power, and those people have a chance of being run by money sent to them by corporations. \n\nAdditionally, I often see that we are left with the choice of \"dumb vs dumber\" in elections. Why are the parties in charge of who represents them? Can't we eliminate the parties and each candidate stands by his own beliefs, not the party's , and then we can elect someone the majority agrees with?\n\nCMV. "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

This principle is key to most modern justice systems, and is intimately tied to high standards of evidence and a strong presumption of innocence.\n\nThe problem is, letting a guilty criminal go free causes the innocent to suffer. It keeps the victim, or victim's family, from gaining closure or a sense of justice, not to mention any kind of restitution. More importantly, it leaves a criminal on the streets, where he can offend again. A crime going unpunished will also encourage other potential criminals, as this will show how easy it is to commit the crime in question with impunity.\n\nTake a murder. If one innocent person is convicted of murder, his or her life is more or less destroyed. Of course that's regrettable. But if ten or, all the more so, 100 murderers walk free, a certain number of them will re-offend, and a major disincentive to other murderers (the fear of punishment) will be undermined. The net result of this will almost certainly be more murders, which will mean the destruction of more than one innocent life. Clearly this is the worse outcome.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not quite advocating a presumption of guilt, but I think the presumption of innocence should be weaker. Juries shouldn't be told to look for \"proof beyond reasonable doubt,\" something like \"a strong likelihood\" of guilt should be sufficient for a conviction.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Firstly by \"spreading goodwill\" I mean a huge, official initiative to help out other countries, a  larger scale of aid  to improve the quality of life. This isn't the kind of aid that has the condition, \"we'll give this if we can put a military base here\" - the U.S.  would ask nothing in return. I admire what Brazil is doing to make themselves a leader in peace, but most people don't even realize they are becoming that - I believe the U.S. should be very vocal about their good deeds so people actually know it. Now some nations have a real deep hatred for us, and with all the meddling we have done in the past it's hard to blame them. So mayve doing this won't do a damn thing for them; many of the rural populations of the world will have no idea it's the U.S. sending them all this aid. Even though, I think many of the leaders of opposing nations wouldn't want to harm someone who is not only helping them out but also has helped out everyone else (who would likely come to the U.S. aid or not ally with the enemy). We would not just cut out $400 billion on the budget overnight; the military roots run deep in the U.S. and something like that cannot be undone fast. So my supposed goodwill campaign would  be a many year plan where the budget is broken down little by little. Jobs that were supported by the millitary would be lost, but new jobs would result from this program too.\n\nI know this is a very idealized situation and would never happen, but I've always thought about it and never really thought of a downside to being nice to people."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I have never owned a gun.\n\nI consider myself liberal to the point of seeing liberty as the ultimate goal of any good governance, and also consider unrestrained capitalism antithetical to my conception of liberty, distancing me from right-libertarians in the US. My ideal form of governance would be a federation of nested councils with decentralised social control of public goods (socialised medicine, free-at-the-point-of-delivery education, common land etc). I am also highly skeptical of centralised government in general, and hate surveillance and control measures. I empathise to some degree with those in the US that do not wish to turn over their guns to the government out of a very real fear of tyranny. This is not necessarily directly relevant to the issue, but I think it will help you understand my position.\n\nGuns where I come from are a tool, mainly rifles and shotguns for hunting and pest control on agricultural land, and not for personal protection, although in principle I see nothing wrong with this. Leftists and liberals in general seem to come from a blinkered urban environment in which they get their food from the supermarket, and see guns as a big bad that people use to kill others, when the reality is much more complex. \n\nGun deaths are awful, and I believe that changing the wider culture glorifying militarism and violence as the solution to our personal and national problems will be a much more effective way to combat gun violence than simply banning tools that are useful, when these bans are enacted top-down by people who do not understand what guns are, and they are pushed for by urbanite liberal-centrist media commentators who understand nothing of real life in the countryside.\n\nIs my position reasonable? Does it contain contradictions? I've not totally worked out my position and feel it may be wrong, as our statistics in the UK show a tiny amount of gun violence in comparison to, say, the US.

This is causing the brain to not think for its self and become lazy, and also dumber as a whole with out calculators. Leaving the average 5th grader to be smarter at mental math then high school kids (As masses, not PRE-AP or AP students, because they are only about 10% Of the whole picture)\n\n\n\n\n**Video games:** The amount of time kids use playing video games is destructive to our society, they do not allow the kid to get any exercise, or exercise the brain in the moderation they are used today. We have came to the point where instead of parenting out children, we stick them in front of a TV because it easier to have them distracted instead to discipline a child. Because Technology has once again found a way to replace human innovative thought, with a detraction.\n\n\n**24 hour news:** If you are to compare journalism 30 years ago, to journalism today, you see that our mainstream way of obtaining news is filth. Most of it is just repetitive ga-ga.Even in the hugest stories, there isn't enough going on to necessitate constant coverage. 9/11, the Russian conflict going on, all of these were major major stories, but when viewed through 24 hour coverage you get a lot of the same stuff rehashed over and over again. Just touch on the main points and let us know when there's new information. That's all we need.\nMost of 24 news ends up being commentary from people whose opinions shouldn't matter anyway. I also think it makes us over analyze potential world leaders and there personal lives, so we vote for the person who appears to look the best, not vote for the person who may not look the best, but makes the best decisions.\n\n\n**The Internet:**  Things like social media, netflix, reddit, all ingulf peoples lives to where everything is accessible to us. What does the common teenager do when they are bored? Check facebook, instagram, twitter. What do they do again when they look through all of those and are still bored? Check all of them, again. This generation that is growing up right now, will be the fall of society, because everything is expected to be instant, and in front of them. \n\n\n\nThe ability to  access information is amazing, everything can be so helpful and useful, but I believe we have gone to far. We constantly are improving technology like the above stated, trying to get \"Better and better!\" But When is enough, enough? I believe we have already hit there, because the generation that is growing up is loosing the ability to think rationally and for themselves. Bringing us as people, down as a whole."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

CMV. + \n + \nBefore mentioning anything, I'd like to note that I am by no means demonizing the feminism movement or anything of that nature. Instead, I'm referring to allocation of jobs; many other industries (i.e, hard sciences) received a great boon after the feminist displays in 1910 and after. However, I believe that this shift of allocation has damaged the American education system, and have only been affirmed since I've began my last year as a student teacher.\n\nIn colonial times (1772 until the end of the 18th century, essentially) teachers were primarily male; you'd honestly be hard pressed to find a female as an educator in this time, but it certainly was plausible as being an educator wasn't seen as a career. Instead, most teachers used their experience in education as a stepping stone in order to advance to other jobs, such as medical jobs, law jobs, and religious jobs. \n\nThis primarily male system continued in place until about 1820-1830. However, because of the large amount of secretarial work that comes with being an educator, most teachers did not consider education as a primary profession and instead were siphoned into fields that I mentioned prior. This only became a greater issue with westward expansion of the United States, so additional educators were required to be adopted. It was around this time that the standard of female educators (which we still hold today, but no where near to the same degree) was formed. In addition, because of females being employed into the educational field, education began to be seen as a primary occupation (albeit one that only females pursued, similar to secretarial work). \n\nHonestly, this sort of educational system lingered until late 1800s-early 1900s, with it really picking up steam in 1910s. At this time, feminism as a movement is coming into full swing; the women teacher's rebellion followed along with it. Initially, this forms into having teachers unions, better benefits, and a gamut of other improvements.\n\nBut, after the feminism movement (mid and post 1930s) had largely made ground, female educators were (similarly to males) siphoned from education as a field and into hard sciences, medical, and law fields.  **Because of this siphoning, I believe that our education system experienced a crash and has never recovered from it.**\n\nMany of the educators at this time, who were siphoned, became prize winning biologists, physicians, chemists, doctors, and a gamut of other high caliber occupations. These individuals were, quick frankly, brilliant. At no other point of history after 1930s can we really say that education is filled with brilliant individuals, primarily because they were siphoned into other occupations (yes, males were in the 1700s, but as females adopted education as a field, education didn't experience a crash). Even today, the demographic of educators is no where near the intellectual caliber as at this time (and I say that going into education myself!). This is not to say there was not brilliant teachers, as I have the pleasure to interact with them on a near daily basis and refine my pedagogical skills, but we certainly do not have the prize winning hard science individuals teaching our children like we did in the 1920s and prior. \n\nI'll mention again that I'm not demonizing the feminism movement. After this movement, there were undeniable leaps and bounds in hard sciences, and those discoveries would not have been possible without those women leaving educational positions and trading in their chalkboards for lab coats. However, education has (and still is!) experiencing a drought that it honestly cannot recover from. In order to recover from this drought, you have to make education more attractive to those who are interested in pursing doctoral and master degrees. Education is always experiencing budget cuts, has an awful public image, and is an incredibly demanding job when considering its time:money ratio. \n\nI do not believe that it is possible to make education more attractive for these individuals who otherwise would pursue hard sciences, law, and medical fields. The only real reason I hear of individuals being passionate about education is from intrinsic value, and that's certainly not something that can be advertised to everyone (Come teach! You'll find meaning or something!). Unless there's some massive rework of the education system to make it more attractive (and, honestly, who sees that coming when education isn't a field lead by educators?), I see no real way education in the United States can recover from its current drought.\n\nCMV."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Here are my two exceptions where I feel it is the fault of the door-opener:\n\n1. When the driver or passengers leave the vehicle when it is not in a proper parking spot. This is an illegal time to open the door anyway. I've seen videos taken in New York of Taxi passengers being like \"this is the best spot to get out, even though my Taxi is still in the middle of the road\", and then BAM. Door prize. This is the passenger's fault.\n\n2. When the driver opens the door into a **marked** bike lane (without ensuring it is safe to do so). Note: if the bike lane is positioned correctly, it should never be within the door range of a parked car anyway, so this situation *should* never exist, but in reality it sometimes does exist. In the situations where it does exist, I think that since the driver had to safely cross a **marked** bike lane to park their car, it should be incredibly obvious that they need to be careful when opening their door on the way out. That's why in this situation I think it's the fault of the door-opener.\n\nNow on to my arguement. First off, I do cycle on the road in a decent size city from time to time (I used to do it full time), so I am sympathetic to the plights of cyclists. I'm not just an ignorant driver yelling from my spot of comfort.\n\n(When I do ride, I feel like I ride in a very safe, patient, predictable fashion. For example, I don't pass by cars stopped at intersections because I don't feel that it is reasonable for them to be expected to see me. I'll sit directly behind them in line with their license plate, and I'll let them do what they are doing without me making an erratic, sudden, unexpected pass. If I can't get directly behind them, I'll still let them turn right or left or whatever without darting in front of them or near them. Cars have many blind spots and motorists can't be reasonably expected to check all of them all the time as well as monitor what's in front of them *while* making a turn. Not even the best, most-attentive driver in the world could do so. Therefore, I ride the way I do not only to keep myself safe, but to make life easier and less stressful on motorists. We're all in this together.)\n\nDoor-prizing is probably the best example of cyclists having an attitude like \"People have to watch out for me in *blank* situation! I'm not at all going to help them not make a mistake in *blank* situation just because I'm not legally required to do so even though I could make the same mistake if I was them.\". I understand how in the law it is written that a motorist must always open their door only when it is safe to do so. However, I do not agree with this law as I do not feel that is it reasonable to blame a driver for opening his or her door into the path of a cyclist. Here's why:\n\n1. Even the best, most attentive driver can miss a cyclist that is riding close enough to be door-prized. You can shoulder check, mirror check, or whatever. If a cyclist is within only a few feet of that side of your car and coming fast, then they can be difficult to see until it's too late. This is especially true if they are riding parallel with your driver side tires when you are making your checks and then they suddenly turn out to go around you when you go to open the door.\n\n2. Pedestrians are expected to cross at crosswalks. Why?  Because a driver can't be expected to monitor for pedestrians that are crossing at every part of the road from every direction, so we put the crosswalks at certain parts of the roads so that the drivers know where to expect pedestrians. Similarly, it's just as reasonable to say, \"cyclists, it is illegal for you to ride in the range of the doors because it's not reasonable for drivers to expect you to be on simply any part of the road you want. You have to be where they expect traffic. They don't expect traffic right next to them when they are parked.\"\n\n3. The cyclist, for their own safety, should not be riding in range of the doors. They are doing something incredibly dangerous by riding in the door range of parked cars. If someone is doing something incredibly dangerous, and someone hurts them as a result, then often the person who hurts them should not be held at fault. I feel this is one of those situations.\n\n4. Door-prizing a cyclist is a mistake anyone can easily make, and it's **much** easier to teach the cyclist not to ride in the door-prize lane than it is to teach the driver to ensure that every single time they open their door they need to spend the 2 to 3 seconds to do their best to make sure no cyclist is about to dangerously pass them (even if the driver is preoccupied, in a rush, distracted by a child wanting to get out of the car, etc.). Keep in mind you're not just teaching drivers, you'd have to teach children too because anyone can be opening one of the doors on that side of the car. Also, I think you'd be dishonest with me if you say that every single time you open your car door you are 100% aware of what's next to you. You're lucky that there was never an irresponsible cyclist those times that you did.\n\n\nFinally a cyclist might argue \"sometimes I need to cycle in the 'door-prize lane' because there's not enough room for cars to pass me if I ride further to the left\". In that situation you should simply \"take the lane\", which means that you ride in the centre of the lane so cars cannot pass you. This is 100% legal; you are still riding as far to the right as is safe to do so. If there are cars parked along the side of the road, then the traffic on that road is likely slow enough that you will have little trouble \"taking the lane\". If cars need to pass and you'd prefer to not have them sit behind you, you can move over into the \"door-prize lane\" and **stop** and wait until it's reasonable to move into the regular traffic lane again.\n\n\n\n\n\n* The hazard of riding near parked cars is incredibly obvious to the cyclist but the hazard of opening the car door is not so obvious to the door-opener because of human nature and what we are taught.\n\n* The cyclist has more control over where he/she rides than we have control over our occasional forgetfulness (or ignorance), especially while doing something as innocent to our brain as opening a door, no matter how hard we try or how responsible and cautious of a person we are.\n\n* The cyclist is **knowingly and deliberately** doing something that is well-understood to be quite dangerous when there are alternatives (even if you are forced into the \"door-lane\", you can always ride slowly there or even come to a stop if that's what it takes to ride safely), while the door-opener is **unknowingly and accidentally** doing something dangerously that 99.99% of the time is safe and harmless.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Affirmative action has done little if anything in almost 50 years to change this situation. \n\nI believe the [proposed gender quotas](http://www.quotaproject.org/publications/WPS_2004_1.pdf) [in boardroom composition](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/02/140224081115.htm) and [college admisions for scientific careers](http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/06/20/usa-whitehouse-titleix-idINL1E8HKJNC20120620) be broaden: not to put a minimum number of female or minority members, but to put a maximum limit of white males. Limit the number of white males that can follow scientific careers, the number of white males that can be leading an investigation team, that can become CEOs or be members of the board of directors, etc.\n\nI posit that its impact would be greater than just the inclusion of minorities in the higher spheres of society: by breaking the patriarchal dominance in those fields, new paradigms in business and science will be born that would challenge the more oppressive and brutal corporate capitalism and the [white male \"rational\" approach](http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1995----02.htm) to science. \n\nThat way, racism and misogyny would lose two big and important sources of power from which they build their oppressive systems."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It seems that the themes and tenets of Christianity are far superior. Christianity is simply an improvement to Judaism, which focuses on the arbitrary rules of an overtly vengeful and hateful God, as outlined in Leviticus. Though I understand the Old Testament is part of Christianity, in the New Testament, Jesus dismisses the often ridiculous, hateful, and discriminatory rules of the OT. For example when a Pharisee asks Jesus if they should stone an adulterer (as Deuteronomy would demand), he says, \"He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.\" Jesus replaces these archaic rules with the idea that love, forgiveness, leading a good life, etc are what is important. He says this throughout many parables, for example \"A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you.\" Furthermore, Islam does not seem to contain these positive tenets, but instead promotes discrimination, sexism, and violence. While Christianity would tell you that you should love everyone and treat them well, e.g. in regards to serving god and going to heaven, Jesus says thanks the righteous for \"whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me,\" Judaism would tell you to stone sinners, and Islam to kill infidels. It seems that positive themes attributed to Islam and Judaism are entirely contrived and do not have basis in scripture, or have only a few isolated passages that support them.

CMV. + \n + One of the main reasons it is considered immoral to kill others is that you are depriving them of the life they would have lived. That, if you assume they would live a happy life, it would be better for them to live than to not live. That it's better to have a happy existence than no existence at all, and killing someone is depriving them of all the happiness they would have had had they not been killed.\n\nHowever, I don't see why this same argument should not apply to unborn, nonexistent people as well. I'm not just talking about unborn fetuses, but also about people who haven't been conceived. If it's better to live than to not live, why isn't it wrong to *not* create as much life as possible? Surely it would be better for someone to be alive than not alive? Surely people would rather live than not have lived at all?\n\nI have yet to see a reason why once someone is born (or, from some perspectives, conceived) the potential life they have suddenly becomes important. I understand that obviously there's a big difference (they are now alive and weren't before), but I don't see why, from an ethical perspective, that should change the value of their future life. Before they were born they had many years of potential future life, and once they are alive they still have many potential years of future life; why does already being alive add value to that potential future?\n\nThis leads me to the conclusion that every child one could have but doesn't is equivalent to killing a person, because you are depriving them of the life they could have had. This means that not having as many kids as possible over your lifetime would be committing a ton of murder. I don't think it makes sense for this to be the case, but I see no reason why it shouldn't be. CMV."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I was recently thinking, am I a Feminist? And the answer I came to was it depends on the definition. I don\u2019t think it is completely invalid, I think has some valuable insights. I think way too many people ride it off completely and other people are way too defensive about any perceived attack on it. I couldn\u2019t even come up with a coherent definition for Feminism.  Even the trite equality between men and women is not a very good. Because there are a lot of forms of equality. Separate but equal was a form of equality, and there are plenty of other forms of equality that could be in the definition. Then it occurred to me the the philosophy has gotten too large to be useful anymore and a split or shatter would benefit everyone. I am studying economics and almost everyone has a school of thought they subscribe to Marxist, Post-Keynesian, Austrian, MMT, and the people within these schools usually disagree with their school occasionally, which is fine, but by having a more specific title it allows for better communication. Feminism is an old philosophy, it started in the 1800s, and it quite odd it hasn\u2019t rebranded or self-destructed by now. That might make you think I hate it, but I don\u2019t. Self-destruction is the natural part of a lifecycle of ideas. For instance psychology has advanced from days of Freud, and most psychologists specialize in a specific type of psychology.  Now these sub-schools already exist (sex positive, cyber, analytical). Additionally, by designating schools we could actually have honest debates about specific views and ideas without bringing the entire amorphous philosophy into it.  I respect Radical Feminists for knowing what they believe and articulating it, I just disagree with everything they believe.  It could help more people into the umbrella of Feminism, as a lot of people who don\u2019t identify as feminist I believe don\u2019t want to be associate with people they perceive as crazy.  I see no reason why anyone should keep with a term that is not informative, archaic and somehow needless divisive. Or maybe I\u2019m crazy, CMV. "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

But any more than that is just wasteful.\n\nI also believe the government(s) of the world are too well-prepared and have all the needed tools to avoid any sort of collapse.  Pandemics can be quarantined easily thanks to the spread and availability of information.  Economic collapses can be overcome by printing more money and stimulating the economy (because apparently inflation doesn't happen anymore and government debt doesn't mean anything... especially for the USA).  Revolt and civil unrest won't last long because police forces have so many guns and soldiers (especially in the US).  Peak oil is a supply/demand problem.  Nuclear or World War is simply stupid and no nation would willingly enter one.\n\nThe \"collapse\" people always predict is coming will never come.

Now we have the internet.  True democracy hasn't been around since Athens--the last time all the people in a society was feasibly able to get together in a forum to vote.  But now it's possible.\n\nI think it would work just fine, and it would even mesh well with our current system.\n\nIt's very frustrating how our current parties align. It's like they're perfectly aligned to create maximum fighting between themselves, but in the end up being exactly the same on all the most important issues, like war, monetary policy, labor rights, and energy investment--where the policy of both is pretty much \"Fuck you.\"\n\nVoting on issues would make it so someone who is very religious could vote pro-life, but also pro-environmentalist.\n\nSomeone could vote for gay marriage, but also against gun control.  Right now, these things are essentially impossible in national elections.\n\nCMV\n\nOr go to /r/openparty/ and start working it out if you agree:\n\n\n\n\na)a system where every single vote has to be done through every single person.  \n\nb) a system where people can then vote on policies related to the system itself, and so could evolve.\n\nI was imagining (b) when I posted this, but there's a lot of discussion around (a) as well.\n\n\n-Most people are stupid\n\nOK, that's a common opinion, not one that I personally hold.

It's been shown time and time again that crowdsourcing performs just fine.  \n\n-Voter Turnout\n\nPeople wouldn't be forced to vote on topics that don't apply to them or they don't understand.  In fact, they could just as well be encouraged not to.  I see it as a negative that I vote for Obama because I want public healthcare, but then I also have to go with his opinion on farm subsidies, when I don't know what that is, and I don't have time to research it.

CMV. + \n + To expand, I think the reason we don't kill people generally isn't because it might hurt them, but because it deprives them of what is termed a future of value. Deprivation of an ability to live and experience all other rights and privileges is what I think is heinous and it is why I think we don't allow killing generally. I think this right to life necessarily extends to viable foetuses regardless of whether or not their life is comparable to that of a born and developed person, because they too have a future of value.\nMy caveats are for non-viable foetuses, as mentioned above and who have no prospect of a future of value, and for threats to the mother's life, which can be justified on the same grounds of self-defense.\nI don't think the arguments of bodily sovereignty that I see floating around Reddit or Tumblr (whereby a foetus occupies a mother's womb with her permission since they make use of her organs and sustenance) fly because an abortion requires an active undertaking to violate the bodily sovereignty of the foetus. I don't think this is justifiable because we extend the right of bodily sovereignty to people as a safeguard against their being killed. This has to extend to foetuses too, because I've explained how I think they must receive this equal right to life.\nLastly, I don't think any of this can be brushed away by saying it's a personal issue of choice for individual women. If we grant that the foetus is not an inhuman life, but rather a human one, then I think it needs to be a social question that regards the foetus as having the same potential in it's future as any other member of society.

Finally, it doesn't improve the black condition. + \n + While I know this is a popular topic, I feel that I have specific points in my argument that have not been addressed before.\n\nFull disclosure: I am an Asian living in a high income white town, [Glastonbury, CT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury,_Connecticut) In addition, as a high performing student, I am directly affected by Affirmative Action. In my defense, I would point out that a black/hispanic on the other side would be just as affected. With this argument, everyone has a bias and an agenda. \n\nFirst the facts:\n [SAT Scores](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action_in_the_United_States#Bias_against_Asians_and_whites) (Note: while this is in the criticism sections, please only look at the data and not the editorial comments, as to get a non-biased outlook)\n\n[Black graduation](http://www.jbhe.com/features/50_blackstudent_gradrates.html) (Note: as this is called the \"Black Journal of Higher Education\", I trust that no one will call me out on using a source that favors my case)\n\n       1. Let's address my last claim first: It doesn't improve the \"black condition\" and is unnecessary for the vast majority of blacks/hispanics\n\n-This idea is supposed to \"level the playing field\" with all races. All this actually does is passes deserving and intelligent Whites and Asians over for less intelligent and undeserving people in an environment they can't succeed in. For example, [black graduation rates are much lower than white graduation rates.] (http://www.jbhe.com/features/50_blackstudent_gradrates.html) The difference reaches up to +20 points, which is clearly not equality. This disparity is due to affirmative action putting incompetent and undeserving Blacks and Hispanics in college. However, I must make an important clarification. I believe that the vast majority of blacks can succeed in college, and have done so. Affirmative action is not necessary for these kinds of people. The only people affirmative action helps are those who wouldn't be able to get into college otherwise, and by getting them into college, they will only have false expectations and ultimately perform poorly when they realize that college grading is color blind. This is the idea of [mismatching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action#Mismatching) and has been backed up by research. \n\n          2. Affirmative action unfairly favors blacks/hispanics over Asians, and thus is racist towards Asians. \n\n-Ok, you make the argument that this favoritism towards blacks/hispanics is simply reparations for past transgressions, Jim Crow and the low. Well, Asians have been heavily discriminated against in the past. Jap interment, railroad building, and racial slurs and stereotypes have all been a part of Asian-American history. In fact, I'd argue that hispanics have been least discriminated in US history. [wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_the_United_States#Asian_Americans) From this, if you believe that AA is \"payback\" for past actions, defend the favoring of blacks over Asian Americans.\n\n           3. Affirmative action is a result of blacks/hispanics that just want to favor their own race. \n\nNote: I must admit, for this I have no direct proof, only my anecdotal experience and statements made by others.\n\n-Blacks/Hispanics have more political power in this country than Asians, in both positions of government and constituents in voting. Therefore, I believe AA is simply a way to get the black vote/blacks helping out each other. Obviously, being against this political suicide and will get the racist tag labeled in a second. Clarence Thomas, as he is unaffected by these factors as he is appointed and he is black (this is a big factor, a white Justice would get labeled racist), is able to speak out and say that affirmative action is indeed racist, not only towards other races, but blacks themselves. [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas#Equal_protection_and_affirmative_action)\n\n\nThis is my case. While I do admit I believe very strongly in my position, I would point out that I have remained civil in my point, provided sources, and made full disclosure in my situation and any opinions not directly proven by facts. Most importantly, I recognize that I am heavily influenced by this topic, and thus may be blinded. I hope we can have a civil discourse.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

My future and sometimes the future of the human race. It seems to me that regardless of our beliefs, culture, technological advances or any other accomplishments, we are slowly walking towards self-destruction. We kill each other, we hurt each other, we do all sorts of imaginable harmful actions to each other and we simply don't care enough to do anything significant about. I'm including myself in that analysis, of course. People live their lives looking for love, family, a good career, happiness among other things and even when for some miracle they find all the things they want, they eventually die. And after that, all of those efforts and hope mean nothing anymore, because you don't exist and the good effect of the things you lived for can no longer be felt, since your consciousness is gone. It's like you, or the conscious being behind your self-awareness and imagination is less important than a rock, since it's more likely that it will exist longer than you will, and although it's going to make less of a difference in the universe, it's not like you're going to get to feel better about it. In death, you and that rock are the same, nothing but a pile of matter that serves no purpose anymore. \n\nOnce all humans die, the entire universe and its amazing knowledge will be forever lost and our existences will be like the things we hope for: nothing. The universe will be empty, darker and pointless. All the amazing and incredible things that exist, will mean nothing. Life is going to be nothing. There will only be things and then nothing. \n\nI think that another billion years from now, humans and their quest for purpose and meaning will be in the past, a completely irrelevant piece of small story of the universe. The things that still exist will simply exist and nothing more. Even if for some miracle there is life somewhere in the universe, they'll probably never know about us and our story will be forever lost in the darkness of our galaxy.\n\nBut we don't care. We still live our lives, fight small wars, try our best to make our limited existence to have a point, to mean something to be something to be proud and happy about. So what? No matter the reason someone has to feel good about their lives, the feeling, together with their live will disappear. It will be to the rest of us, nothing but a thing.  And then we all together will be a thing. And then nothing.\n\nWhy is it so important then to find things out? To push forward and try to live longer and better? It doesn't matter. Nothing is going to change the outcome: death. No matter how good your life and the things you've done are, you are going to be gone. You, now the self-aware being capable to read this and disagree and think that I'm crazy and write a response, or save a life, or built a school and draw the next La Guernica or compose the next Moonlight Sonata, will soon be nothing but a piece of inanimate matter. And any of the previous things you did will help you. The Moonlight Sonata will still be here with us, but Beethoven is nothing. It's like the creation is better than the creator. Some people think that we live through the work we have done. I prefer to have done nothing worth of attention and live forever than save millions of people and then feel so bad that I kill myself like Alan Turing.\n\nIf everything ends, what is the point of doing anything? It's like playing a game you'll never win, fighting an opponent you can't ever beat, swim in an ocean that has no shores. The beauty of math? So what? When we, humans, cease to exist what will math be? Nothing. Nobody will be here to learn anything more.\n\nSo, that's my inner demon. Why should I try to do my best at anything if the satisfaction will disappear and then I'll, then my body, then all of us, then everything?"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

There are many variations of bottle designs, but overall we can group these into two categories: \"cap on top\", where the cap is at the top of the bottle and as far from the base as possible, and \"cap on bottom\" where the bottle actually sits on its cap.\n\nCap on bottom designs are a fairly recent invention, made possible by the use of arbitrary plastic shapes for liquid packaging. So I understand that cap on top designs are entrenched, culturally.\n\nSome products (often shampoo and conditioner pairs) actually use the same packaging, but with labels in opposite orientation to suggest that one end our the other is the top. I don't care about that: my only concern here is that the product can sit stably on the cap, regardless of whether the text is now upside down. I would count that as a \"cap on bottom\" design because the bottle can sit on its cap without concern of toppling.\n\nMy argument is very simple: cap on bottom designs are better, because as the remaining liquid gets to a low level, it remains by the spout and can easily be ejected. Otherwise, high-viscosity liquids require a lot of shaking and squeezing to eject from the bottle, as they have settled to the end furthest from the spout.\n\nI believe cap on top designs (defined here as designs where the bottle cannot rest on its cap without being at risk of falling over) are functionally inferior, with no functional advantages. The only advantage to them at all is that, by having no concern for stability, the cap can be artistically shaped for visual pleasure in arbitrary ways. I don't think this is anywhere near as important as being able to easily access the contained product, and this I believe I would be happier if all liquid shower products had cap on bottom designs.\n\nPlease try to convince me that the \"cap on top\" design has redeeming qualities, so I can stop being annoyed by them.\n\nCMV!"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I find this to be an amazing idea. If we assumed that all laws are perfect, then there's no need for trial by juries. Twelve judges with greater understanding of the law would make better jurist if all we're concerned with is if a person committed an act that's in violation of the law. With nullification, instead we have 12 reasonable people determining if the law is reasonable in this case. Not only is the person being put on trial, the law itself must be defended by the prosecutor as being justified in this specific case.\n\nIn the US, with its four levels of courts: local, county, state and federal; it provides a protection against abuses of jury nullification. For example, if a man murders a black lady is found not guilty by jury nullification in a county trial, the state and federal government can still convict him. The reason being though the murder was one act, the different levels of government each have their own laws against murder. The rules against double jeopardy do not apply in cases of different institutions convicting a person as they're different laws.\n\nI not only think that jury nullification is a great idea, I believe it should be allowed for the defense to explain to juries about their right to acquit the defendant even if they believe he committed the crime. This in turn can help lead to changes in laws if legislatures begin to see that the people are not convicting other people for certain laws they find unjust. \n\nTo put it in perspective, I see the Appeals, District and Supreme Court as putting the law on trial in all cases. The Jury puts the law on trial for this one case.\n\nChange my View."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Maybe the Gestapo member is super nice. Maybe he even has some Jewish friends. Maybe he's just doing his damn job. Yea, walking in the street is illegal, and so is stealing cigars.

But the law itself and the society they're in has institutionalized a systemic form of discrimination against the Jew. The Jew would have no obligations whatsoever to respect the authority of the Gestapo. Yes, it might be dumb to punch the Gestapo- I won't deny that. The Gestapo will likely kill the Jew now. But was it morally wrong to hit someone who is enforcing a morally repugnant system? Of course not. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter how legally justified the Gestapo's actions are, they're still trying to enforce a morally repugnant system that specifically targets the Jewish people. Therefore it's self defense.\n\nUnless you deny that American law and society are systematically discriminating against poor people and black people, the analogy holds.\n\nBut even if you don't think that, insofar as American law and society are promoting *any* kind of injustice, then the analogy holds, because then cops become the ground-soldiers and enforcers of that injustice.\n\nTherefore, a cop who operates in an unjust framework is automatically waging war against you. Attacking him is morally justifiable as an act of self defense."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Coming from a very competitive environment, I have definitely become used to the stresses associated with comparing myself to others.

I say this because when you compare yourself, it allows you to see where you stand against others and can cue a desire to improve.\n Furthermore, I think the argument of 'we are all unique people, so why compare' is a way to justify our desire not to work for the results. This view allows us to be content with our flaws and gives us the cue that we can't achieve those goals that others have achieved when. I honestly believe that if I stop comparing myself to people, I will lose the edge in my career path (music) and will not be viewed as serious.  \n Ultimately, people who do not compare themselves are not being realistic and are hiding from reality. In the real world, we are always compared against other people and this is how we grow against others.

These so-called swear words have been a part of my natural vocabulary for such a long time, I just consider them regular colloquial language; my sister and most of my friends agree that there is nothing wrong with saying the word fuck in public, in front of family or children etc., and I find this to be pretty typical of our generation.  \n\nOf course, when I am speaking in a business/professional environment, the dynamics of appropriate language to use in such circumstances etc. and that's all well and good; but when I say something along the lines of \"wow, that's fucked up\", \"bullshit\", \"fuck ow my finger\" etc., I think someone sticking their head into the situation to berate you for your choice of words (and not their meaning or intent) is an inappropriate way of attempting me to conform to their social customs.  \n\nPlease note: insulting/abusing someone does not fall under the scope of what I'm talking about, that's another thing entirely.  \n\n----  \n\nSecond: discussion of sex.\n\nNot overly graphic depictions, not harrassment, leering or other sexually creepy things directed at unwilling participants; just plain old (what I would consider normal) conversation of a sexual topic.  \n\nEg.: Over lunch my coworker told me that she was thinking about buying a new vibrator, we had a bit of back and forth over colours, prices, styles etc. Someone overheard us and made it known that she was \"offended\" by our conversation and proclaimed that it was sexual harassment in the workplace.  \n\nAnother example, we got into a conversation about how fascinatingly specific some of the gay-hankey-colour-codes were, with different fabrics having different meanings, again we got the same response as above.  \n\n----\n\nThere are many more, but it's typically the source of 80% of the use of the word 'offensive', a kind of mechanism that IMO is the adult equivalent of a 4 year old stomping their foot and telling people to stop it because they don't like it."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

My father immediately informed me that evolution was false for religious reasons.  My entire analysis of evolution has been based on the idea that macroevolution is false.  With this in mind, after discussing Darwin and evolution at a high school level, I formulated a view that I still hold to this day.  Evolution occurs on small scales with species, but these species do not hold a common ancestor.  I cannot say for certain how many species of birds existed at the beginning, but I certainly accept that there are more species now, because species adapt and natural selection takes hold.  I do not believe; however, that humans are direct descendents of any species, and I do not believe that birds and dogs (for example) had any common ancestor.  In forming this belief, I have rejected certain levels of scientific consensus, but I have never rejected any information that I felt refuted this.  \n\nIn any case, what I am looking for are examples that prove that a dog may have had the same ancestor as a bird (or something along those lines).

CMV + \n + This is a very specific to peer-reviewed scientific journals and does *not* include recent initiatives like Obama\u2019s push to increase access to public/government-funded data [^1](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/02/22/expanding-public-access-results-federally-funded-research) \n\nThe main crux of my argument is that, *if adopted universally*, the open-access model of peer-reviewed scientific research for journals would effectively shift the cost burden from the reader/consumer of scientific literature to researchers/producers and this is a net-negative for the advancement of science overall.\n\nAssumption 1: It costs something to create, manage, and publish a scientific journal. The amount is irrelevant, lets just call it $X.\n\nAssumption 2: There are more readers/consumers of scientific research journals than there are researchers/producers. \n\nTo illustrate my point I\u2019ll be using the open-access journal [*PlosOne*](http://www.plosone.org) and the \u2018traditional\u2019 journal [*Nature*](http://www.nature.com). Now if I want to publish a research article in PlosOne it would cost me $1,350 [^2](http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/authors/) They do say that they have waivers available for those who cannot afford this fee, but that \u201cmost authors pay the full fee\u201d. Conversely, a 1-year subscription to Nature for an individual is $199 [^3](http://www.nature.com/ecommerce/subscribe.action?productId=nature). Neither of these costs are negligible, especially for students, but the subscription cost is considerably less prohibitive than the publication cost, especially when you consider the fact that many institutions (both public and private) confer access to affiliates. I've been affiliated with 3 universities in the US in a research role and none of them have ever covered the cost of publishing in an open-access journal (either as a student or full-time researcher)\n\nNow up until this point, nothing I have said supports the notion that this scheme is bad. In fact, I believe the ideal situation is to have a mix of open-access and traditional journals because they serve different purposes. However, I think this issue is obfuscated by the use of the term \u2018open-access\u2019. The reason I believe this model is bad is that it would lead to an environment in which only those with the resources to publish have the opportunity to disseminate their results. Institutions (both academic and private) would have an immense advantage in publishing research and it could narrow the possibility of contrary findings reaching wide audiences. This is obviously a situation in which the truth regarding research could be overshadowed by vested interests. Hypothetically, Pharma company Z could pay to have 50 studies published showing the efficacy of drug Y whereas the small independent group of researchers can only afford 1 study showing the opposite. This would magnify the already existing problem of [publication bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias) and could be disastrous.\n\nThis is getting long already so I\u2019ll just add one more point regarding the advancement of science. I think there are competing interests in the world of science between advancement and dissemination. These two things are not mutually exclusive by any means but are often in conflict. It appears \u2018traditional\u2019 journals are more focused on the former whereas open-access journals are focused on the latter. While dissemination and access are both important I believe that for measured scientific progress to occur we need to encourage more data/results, not less. Universal adoption of the open-access model towards scientific research would be an obstacle to this goal. \n\nCMV!"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

People are worried about their privacy being invaded, but unless you are already being tracked as a result of being linked to a threat or crime, then you shouldn't have anything to worry about.\n\nI'll give two examples:\n\n1) A man searches all kinds of things on the internet - whatever takes his curiousity. Maybe he is curious as to how a simple homemade bomb is made, and searches for it. That kind of search might raise a red flag, and he might be tracked more closely for a little while, but he is not obviously planning anything and so they later ignore him again.\n\n2) A man is consistantly searching for home-made bomb tutorials, maps of US Capitol building (for examples), and posts on forums, discussing his hatred for US government and how 'something should be done to wake them up'. With that kind of data on this person, law enforcers can intervene and make sure he is not going to conduct an attack in the end.\n\nEven in this second case, there needs to be pretty solid evidence of a serious threat for them to convict him.\n\nBut most of what I hear about the NSA is people complaining about their privacy being invaded.

I believe that most of the time, when this argument is used, it is either protecting children from something they do not need protection from and often are things that should be actively discussed with children.\n\nFurthermore, when this argument is used to advocate for something that actually protects children, the detriment to society is generally larger than the benefit for children, e.g. even if drug usage does increase among teenagers after legalization (which I strongly doubt), the negatives of prohibition far outweigh the consequences of more teens doing drugs.\n\nNote: Arguments for increasing socialized benefits do not fall under this argument, as they are beneficial to all of society, not just children. E.g. Increasing school funding doesn't benefit children, it benefits society when those children become adults.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

There were some standard arguments against this, like how it was inhumane to pay someone so little and make them work so many hours. There were also some standard arguments in favor of this saying that the standard of living was lower in other countries and that they were actually getting paid more than anything else they could be doing. \n\nAnyway, fast forward 20 years. We don't really have the same kind of controversy about sweatshops in China. In fact, I feel that the amount of money that we have sent over there has given them the ability to industrialize. They have enough money that they are able to refuse to perform sweatshop work. Their standards of living are high enough where it no longer makes sense to take a sweatshop job. AKA they are able to make more money doing something else. It is no longer makes economical sense to put factories in China. Instead, I find that more clothes are coming from places like the Philippines, and Bangladesh, where I suspect people are willing to work for less money. I expect that around 20 years from now, the Philippines and Bangladesh will be rich enough where they will turn down sweatshop jobs too.\n\nThe sweatshop work in China seems to have been replaced by technology shops, like producing Iphones. This is quite a nice upgrade compared to a sweatshop job, and would not be possible without first industrializing the country. The new controversy nowadays seem to be about people being underpaid and overworked in iphone factories. The characters are different, but the story sounds the same. Same arguments about inhumane treatment, same arguments about how this is in fact good for them.\n\nI feel this type of bad press is detrimental to the development of a land. I believe Philippines / Bangladesh will soon get their turn to say no to sweatshop jobs and follow China's path in upgrading to nicer technology jobs. To stop these factories will simply deny them of the resources they need to raise their standard of living.\n\nCMV!!\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I'm referring to anyone with **primarily** left leaning standards in many key issues. Take the social breakdown of your choice. Nuclear holocaust. Total destruction of computer network infrastructure, Race war. Zombie apocalypse. Alien invasion. Mass riots, Global genocide, superstorms, melted ice caps, famine, pestilence, plague, Revelations, Anything short of an ELE. If society broke down and we as a people were not mollycoddled in the safety of our computers, tablets, and cellphones, then there are certain groups of people who will either give up their ideals or they simply won't be able to make it post apocalypse.\n\n1: **Gun control advocates:** You refuse to own a gun? To shoot another person? You won't be lasting long. Other survivors will have guns. Not everyone who survives will be nice. They will kill you for what you have. And what you have may be the only things keeping you alive. You will have a gun and you will kill or you will be dead.\n\n2: ~~**Anti hunters~~/Vegans/Vegetarians:** You think you're going to live long enough for your victory garden to grow you a food supply?

That everybody will happily share whatever they have? Not hardly. Barter and trade (as well as outright piracy) among survivor groups will be the standard.~~ **CMV'd by /u/MontiBurns\n\n~~4: **Pacifists:** Need I really elaborate? If you won't fight or kill, you will be dead in no time.~~ Unbelievably CMV'd by /u/jetpacksforall\n\n5: **Cop/Soldier haters:**: Your internet snarkiness and protest signs won't be of much use to you now. However, a well trained cop or soldier will be quite the asset to have on your side.\n\n~~6: **Feminists:** Well, I have a feeling that you'll finally actually have that rape culture you're always going on about. Not that I think you'll get much joy out of finally being right. Overall, I think you're gonna have a bad time.~~ CMV'd by /u/Siiimo\n\n~~7: **Race baiters:** Nobody will be in the mood to be hearing the Al Sharptons or the Grand Wizard Cyclopses in the surviving world. People trying to instigate that kind of internal discord when everyone is just trying to scavenge their next meal will mysteriously not be coming back to the base camp after a hunting excursion.~~ CMV'd by /u/Siiimo\n\n8: **Intellectual snobs/Logic mongers:** If you were to question your group leader's decisions and use phrases like \"strawman\" or \"fallacy of the middle\" then you are probably going to be shot in the face. Smarts and intelligence will be needed to survive, but intellectual arrogance will be a liability. \n\n9: **Anti-Death Penalty Advocates:**What are you going to do with that loose cannon in your group? The rapist? The food thief? The captured enemy? Your moral high ground won't save you here.\n\n~~10: **Environmentalists:** I doubt you'll be hugging many trees post apocalypse. You'll be cutting them down with the rest of us for fire and shelter. You'll be eating whatever endangered species crosses your path. You'll either happily kill the last known Fuzzy Feathered Pipsquack Bird and stuff your coat with it's feathers or you'll freeze to death in the nuclear winter.~~ CMV'd by /u/ZanzaraEE  /u/Raintee97 \n\nNow I know that CMV users like to nitpick over word usage and minute details.

That's why I used \"primarily\" in the title. I also know that some of these types will survive if they were to give up or go against their ideals. (Pick up a gun, etc.) The overall point of the CMV is that those who cling to those leftist ideals won't *generally* survive long term. So I will not argue with you over semantics or word usage. (liberal, leftist, useless, etc) I think you're smart enough to argue the spirit of the CMV without resorting to that cliche.\n\nI want someone to show me exactly how [somebody](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/008/067/COLLEGE-LIBERAL.jpg) who insists on clinging to these ideals would survive and be useful to the other survivors.\n\nP.S.

If so, why haven't they made any adjustments to records?\n\nPersonally, I think his family's roots in political activism played a significant part in his desire to go off the grid. Tupac persistently wrote about the government, read a lot of books about philosophy, and given his cult of personality, I think his family was set on making him a major political icon. \n\nMaybe he left sight because he didn't want to abide his family's desires. Maybe he left because he had sources tell him that the government wasn't too happy with his potential influence.

The creators of both of these have taken a very long time to make a sequel without much word on when it will finally be finished. In my mind both of these are clearly unfinished stories and the creator should be held accountable for finishing them in a reasonable amount of time as the audience expects. Constantly delaying it should not be defended unless absolutely necessary, just because it is their work. By making it a series they have implied they will give us an ending and delaying it is unfair to their audiences.

Then husband and I tried opening our marriage with the idea of polyamory, having multiple loving partners.  In theory it's great, in reality didn't work out so well.  But in the mean time I developed a deep and loving relationship with another man.  My husband can not handle it.  He's gone ballistic, we've struggled, tried to work through everything, are in counseling, etc.  \n\nAt the moment the other man and I are \"just friends\" in actions.  We talk, but it's about boring, how's your day, stuff.  No intimate interactions while we all try to sort this out.  But I love him.  I love him more than I knew it was possible to love.  He and I click in this crazy cosmic way.  We make each other whole.  We make each other better.  To imagine life without him, is to take away color from the world.  \n\nI love my husband too.  I love my husband very much.  We have been married 12 years and have three wonderful kids.  But he and I are strained and the kids feel the strain lately too.  And nothing I do is enough, because the fact of the matter is I'm in love with someone else and that makes him crazy.  Even if I love him too.  Even if I am still a good wife in every other way.  Even if I'm not acting on it.  He cries all the time (he is not a man prone to tears), he has nightmares.  I don't think it'll get better while we are in this purgatory.  \n\nI don't want to leave my husband, but I can't stop loving the other man on command and our lives are slowly falling apart.

Some people (including young children) will have to tilt their heads upward to see the screen. It is uncomfortable; continual craning is most likely detrimental to health.\n\n3.

There are so many better seats in the house. Full field of vision is only a few rows back. Sitting in the very back allows you to look forward/down (avoid neck strain) and still get the full movie experience.

Here are the reasons.  Quote or name the item you wish to refute.\n\n1. **Big, bulky, expensive, complicated, and confines you to a fixed space.**  The trend in technology is going the opposite direction: Things that are highly portable, over-simplified and light.  Less complexity, not more, has been the winning strategy.\n\n2. **Difficult to adopt**  Good luck getting grandma and grandpa buying these things, connecting them to a kick-ass expensive computer, and using them at home.  The idea of having grandparents tele-presence into your kids birthday party sounds great, but highly impractical.\n\n3. **Inferior to just using Skype/Facetime/Etc, for interacting with family, friends, and business**  Instead of getting my parents to buy these things along with computers and everything else they need, simply Skyping from their phones not only is quick and easy, but I can also see them and we can communicate in a very human level.  I'm not looking at a tele-presenced robot or orb, I'm looking right at their faces and taking part of all the non-verbal communication that goes along with that.  The tele-presence Skype tablet RC devices are fine - I can see and interact with the people at the other end, and they can see and interact with me.  VR, however, doesn't work.  Even on a virtual business meeting, I don't want to see ridiculous avatars of my partners, I want to see them and communicate effectively.\n\n4. **Not compelling for events such as concerts**  Tele-presence in concerts or special events will not be compelling.  Being at the event is about interacting with everyone around you.  Taking that away, and it's just a crappy app were you can't really see the event clearly nor hear/feel the music the way you can live.  If audio technology that can recreate a live environment becomes commercially available, I rather watch the event on youtube that way. since taking human interaction away, all that's left is enjoying the raw performance.  On a professional recording I get a better view of the stage, better audio, less noise from the crowd, etc.\n\n5.  **Control issues**  A controller that would be great for a FPS video game, is not the same as one for tele-presence, nor the same for playing virtual golf, etc, etc.  There's no clear path to a breakthrough in this area.  It might take 30 years, it might not happen.  For now we are left with it being a sitting experience with some crappy controllers.  Basically glorified 3D glasses, which themselves didn't revolutionize the industry.\n\n6. **Novelty wears off for games**  Play *Fallout3* or *Team Fortress* and it's pretty awesome for the first 10 minutes, but after that, you just want to play the damned game.  Same thing happened with the 3DS.  After 10 minutes, all the 3D would do is get in the way of the experience.  You play a game to play a game, not to look around like a dumbass.  At the end of the day, being able to jump in and out of a video game quickly and easily wins over my desire to stand there looking around like a dumbass.\n\n7. **OK for tele-presenced travel** The one area it might be cool is virtual travelling where I can stand live on a street in Paris, for instance.  However, moving would be very difficult or not done, so limited as well.  I can have a friend in Paris wear a helmet with a VR camera so I can experience what he/she experiences, but it would be quite awkward for him/her, and I'd have no control over what happens.\n\nAs far as I can see, any improvements to fix these problems are either 20-30 years in the future, or might not happen.\n\nNOTE: I don't count AR in this.  AR is a clear win.  Being to see info on anything you see in real life is huge.  For example, looking at someone's car, and being able to see make,model,price,dealers is a win.  Human hunger for raw information is clear.  Another example, is seeing all the words in my environment in my native language (For example, go to China and see English instead of Chinese when you look at any writing in signs, stores, museums, etc).  Maybe even hear English when others speak foreign languages one day.  Look at a star and see it's name and constellation.  Look at a virtual TV in my living room that I can make bigger or smaller at will.  Many many awesome things will be possible with AR.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Although some of these offers sound promising (either because of the company name or because of the compensation), i feel very reluctant to discuss them because i believe i won't like it living / working in the US.\n\n**Background**:\nOur family of 3 (wife, 6-year old kid and me) live and work in Sweden. Although not a paradise (for a number of reasons), it feels like a very decent country to live in. Below i will list some of the things i like about Sweden and what i \"believe\" i know about the US. My assumption, that i don't want to move, is based on the things i \"believe\" i know about the US.\n\n**Compensation**:\nSalaries seem much better in the US (both on paper and assuming that taxation is higher in Sweden). However, some huge differences seem to exist between different areas in the US (based on salaries listed on salary.com).\n\nVacation days seem also to be quite different. In Sweden the norm seems to be 25-30 vacation days per year, while in the US is 15-21 (?). Plus, vacation and sick days are totally different pools. When you get sick you are not paid for the first day, but you receive full pay up to day 14 of sickness. Not sure how this works in the US.\n\nLastly, we have what we call the VAB. This basically means that i can stay at home to take care of my sick kid and be paid 80% of my salary (for that day). Anything equivalent in the US?\n\n**Education**:\nAlthough i believe that graduate and post-graduate education in the US is much better than in Sweden, the fact that i will have to pay a huge amount of money for tuition (university) scares me. In Sweden, all grades of education are free.\n\n**Healthcare**:\nSweden has a state supported health system, which means that worst case scenario i will pay in a year approx $120 for doctor visits (medication not included). Even operations and \"longer\" treatment is covered by this amount. This is definitely not the picture i have from the US, where a sickness can destroy you financially.\n\n**Society**:\nThe Swedish society seems \"calmer\" that what i believe happens in the US. There are of course cases of racism and public disobedience, but not to the extend of Fergusson or some other similar events. Basically, if you live in Sweden, it feels like moving to a \"war zone\" if you move to the US.\n\nAt times, it also feels that the US is returning to the dark ages: Heavy religion influences, tele-evangelists, the Indiana law, \"wars\" outside abortion clinics, fights about gay rights, black/white racism, etc. A huge difference from what i am used to in Sweden\n\n**Epilogue**: So this is my (probably) narrow-minded view of the US, as i perceive it by reading news online (and watching the Last Week Tonight show). So, please CMV that moving to the US is a much better \"thing\" than what i have currently in my mind.\n\n\n\n* Negotiate, negotiate, negotiate\n* Don't expect anything from the government\n* Make sure your health insurance is covered\n* Prefer urban over rural areas (to get a more liberal culture)\n* Save up money for the kid's university education\n* US is not a warzone, it's as safe as Sweden\n* Media overblows everything (and focuses on the negative)\n\nThanks to all who contributed, i learnt a lot, and now i know at least how to continue my research!"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

He likely will have less than no loyalty to the company, would leave the second something better comes along, and might leave anyway for any number of reasons from school demanding too much time to simply not liking the job and not needing extra cash enough to put up with it. \n\n-The ex-con, on the other hand, is almost certainly poor as fuck and desperate for work. He'll put a strong effort in, because he needs the job to survive, and knows that finding another one will be extremely difficult if he gets fired. He will also have fewer competing commitments with school, and is considerably less likely to leave for any reason. \n\n-Some people are concerned the ex-con will steal. While a valid concern, I think it's less likely than one would think. This is a guy who has been to prison, probably been raped on the inside and doesn't want to go back. He's not going to take any chances. High school kids on the other hand don't have the same appreciation for the consequences of their actions, and can steal for any number of reasons too. \n\n-The only exception is hiring convicted child molestors to be put in positions where they have access to kids. Obviously that would be problematic, but any other type of criminal would be fine IMO. "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

CMV + \n + This could be stemmed from my poor social experiences or from what i learnt in my psychology diploma, and soon recently came to the conclusion that there is no true kindness/altruism whatever you call it. \n\nFor a behavior to happen, there needs to be some sort of motivation. Intrinsic or extrinsic, there is a need for people to behave a certain way. Extrinsic motivation is plain and simple. The most common is money. People work for money, people steal for money, people who do charity gain acceptance of society, which in turn lets them earn more from their enterprises since the company they represent is more accepted. That's what i believe. \n\nEven if there is an intrinsic motivation, the person definitely have to do it for his or her own cause. For example, a generous person who makes self-sacrifices for others could gain satisfaction in his own mind that he's done something \"good\" and the social acceptance which he gets would motivate him to do more kind deeds, since society as a whole promotes pro-social behaviors. \n\nOr someone sees an injustice and steps in for the victim. The person seeing the injustice could just be annoyed at the situation and in order to resolve the annoyance he steps in to help the weak. I would also think that that's just a method for the person to deal with some internal unsolved issues to make himself/herself feel better. For example, a man who was a bully victim steps in to fight off some bullies because he did not have the courage to stand up to them when he was younger. Because of that, he may feel a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction in himself. Thus, since there is a personal gain, I do not see pure kindness. \n\nSo basically even when someone does something good or kind, i would attribute it to his or her need to be socially accepted or the self-satisfaction, and when there's personal gain from displaying pro-social behaviors, I do not believe that people can have pure kindness. But hey, that's just my opinion man.\n\n\n\nNo matter how I looked at things, I can always attribute acts if kindness with some form of personal gains. \n\nI may not have phrased it correctly saying that everyone is selfish. I just tend to be quite avoidant at times and think the worst of people. Lol"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Or a winning candidate from an election to be \"humbled\" by the turnout in their favor. The problem is, when they say that, what they are really feeling is great pride and sense of accomplishment, which is decisively not humility. \"Humbled\" often goes hand-in-hand with \"Humiliated\", which is the opposite of what most people who describe themselves as \"humbled\" have gone through. If someone wants to say \"Although I am experiencing great success, I am still humble\", that is ok. However, even that can be a problem as people describing themselves as humble very often imply that that is some great characteristic about themselves, defeating the word (the ironic phrase \"I'm probably the most humble person on Earth\" comes to mind). The only other context someone might describe themselves as \"humbled\" would be if they actually *were* properly humbled; e.g. they lost their house, car, and job and had to actually humble themselves by resorting to begging or a less dignified job, thus becoming \"humbled\". Outside of that context, I believe every usage of a person describing themselves as being \"humbled\" by some opportunity to be not only inaccurate, but polar opposite to what is meant by the word. This degrades the meaning of the word, and turns it into what is now an effectively useless proxy to say that one is proud of their accomplishments but wishes to remain coy about it.

He had been a bomber in World War 2; I forget whether he was a pilot or what, but that's irrelevant to my argument. The response was universally positive, with people calling him a hero etc.\n\nMillions of civilians were killed on both sides during WWII. The majority of Ally-caused civilian deaths were resulted from aerial bombing. Killing civilians is not heroic, it's that simple.\n\nNow I'll preemptively counter some potential arguments.\n\n**Bombers were just following orders.** That excuse was explicitly rejected by the Allies at the end of the war. Personally I find it more convincing than most do, to the degree that I think it should be a valid argument in court. But I'm not proposing we put this bomber on trial, I just don't think we should celebrate him.\n\n**Bombing civilians was necessary to win the war.** Patently false. That strategy was invented to destroy the public's will to fight, but as WWII showed it only makes people fight harder. Being on the right side of the war does not justify your military strategy.\n\n**This guy might have only bombed military targets.** It's entirely possible; the article didn't say. But I'm arguing against bombers as a group, not just this guy. If you can prove to me he didn't bomb civilians, I might agree that he specifically is a hero. However, given the prevalence of civilian targeted bombing bombers should be treated as guilty until proven innocent (I mean as a moral question, not in a court of law).\n\n**It took a lot of bravery to fly during WWII.** It certainly did, airplanes got shot down all the time and given the choice I'd rather be front-line infantry. But bravery does not a hero make. Plenty of actions require extreme bravery but are nonetheless evil, like 9/11.\n\n**The war ended 70 years ago, ex-bombers have since lived lives of peace and contributed positively to society.** I don't doubt it. If I'd met this guy before he died, I'm sure I would find him a pleasant man worthy of respect for the civilian life he's lived. But living a peaceful life does not make you a hero, and it does not undo any evil you may have committed in youth.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

When forced to defend casual statements that people called me out on, I was forced to re-evaluate my views and through this grew and matured as a person.\n\nI can't help but notice that people who I interact with who are under 20 or so and frequent reddit enough to mention it in public for some reason seem to not only hold some pretty strongly anti-woman views (\"feminism is evil\" without having a tiny grasp of what feminism is, the \"friendzone\" is a real thing and not an awful manipulative concept, etc.) which they can't even begin to articulate a defence of when called on. I think that tying opinions like this consequence-free to an anonymous internet points community does nothing more than validate these opinions without encouraging critical thinking about them at all, and that to a lot of younger members on this site they're lead to think that these extreme views are the norm and are acceptable.\n\nI do think SRS goes overboard sometimes, I do think that there's an extent to which they miss that sometimes jokes do make fun of people and that's an uphill fight you'll never win. But I also have a huge problem with the idea that they should be totally hands off. Maybe if people want their internet points they should have to contend fairly with gangs of people who, oh, say, think joking about raping babies should be frowned upon in a public place. It's not a freedom of speech issue, it seems like the rule is set up for freedom from consequence of speech where the people who would normally most strongly object are already frequenting the same part of the site and thus most likely to be perceived as \"vote brigading\" and thus their voice is basically cut off."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

A friend of mine went so far as to call it 'cruel and disgusting' and I laughed in her face because in my opinion she is just so wrong. I've never been able to understand the arguments against it, maybe if I did I'd be able to form another opinion about the situation. \n\n- Neutering/Spaying keeps dogs who's owner don't want puppies from...well...reproducing. It's irresponsible to bring happy, healthy puppies into the world only to abandon them. Thousands of animals in shelters are put down every year, it's immoral to contribute to that.\n- The procedure is common, safe and inexpensive, it eliminates many hormone related behavioral problems in pets (instinctual behaviors which they can't help, often followed by the owner scolding them for it) and there's no compelling reason not to do it. \n- I believe that many people who are against neutering are assigning human emotions to their pets, when that's simply not appropriate. Dogs do not have the same urge to 'start a family', nor do they have the emotional desire to have children. They aren't going to feel 'left out' because everyone else is having babies and they are not, that's silly. \n- Owners who claim they 'keep an eye on their pet enough to make sure they aren't having sex' are naive and are not accounting for the very real possibility that a trip to the dog park and a 10 minute distraction (like a telephone call) can end in pregnancy. \n- Keeping a pet intact and not allowing it to mate is a different form of cruel in my opinion. Bitches in heat have only one agenda, unneutered male dogs cannot resist a female in heat. To keep them from mating when every instinct is telling them to is wrong. \n\nCMV"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Making more beneficial tomatoes for society is asking farmers to sacrifice profits. \n\nThe meat industry has no incentive to find more ethically reasonable systems of working.

It doesnt matter if they do justice to the source material.. .they just need those ticket sales. \n\nThe music industry has no incentive to promote quality music. Nickleback and Soulja Boi are a dime a dozen... there is a billion of them in every city. Radiohead and MF Doom are uncommon artistic talents... Artists have demands, they want their work to be seen a certain way. They are difficult to work with because they dont care how much money you make by representing them, their art comes first. If you can find any rapper or towny-rock band, promote the crap out of them and over-saturate the masses to a premeditated formula of music-- you cut out your necessity to rely on artists for their art. This is all in the name of your bottom line becoming fatter.  \n\n\nThe examples I could outline are almost inexhaustible.

Surely I'm missing something. I have three major issues:\n\n1. You're screwing the kid over, plain and simple. Mommy and Daddy make $100,000/year and don't wanna pay for college, you are quite simply screwed.\n\n2. The only reasonable way to become independent is to get married or pregnant. Are we really going to encourage 18-24 year olds to get married and have kids? That's the most unstable part of your young adult life.\n\n3. People aren't stupid, they see this flaw. You are creating a drift between the socioeconomic classes because poor people get $5,500+ a year and middle class people don't. \"You just got that money because you're poor.\" \"I wish my parents were poor!\" I hear this shit all the time.\n\nThese are some basic arguments because I feel like I'm missing a big piece of this scenario and hopefully all the clouds will part after I am enlightened.\n\n\n4. This places potentially life crippling debt on a person who falls into the category I'm describing. You could ruin someones life over how much their parent makes.\n\n5. To go with that, a student has no control over their parents, and thus really no control over their FAFSA. Yet we award them based on it.\n\n6. To top that piece off, you cause psychological distress by awarding some people and not others over what is basically random chance. A student simply cannot control such aspects of their life.\n\nIf we will award a low income student due to their uncontrolled aspects of life, why will we then turn around and deny a middle class student awards due to their uncontrolled aspects of life?\n\n\n1. This allows your parents to control your life a lot. They might hold money over your head and force a career on you.\n\n\nTo some degree, yes, any such system can be gamed. However, there's a pretty clear limit, and the costs of doing so aren't insignificant. FAFSA funding is incredibly important for those who need it, but in comparison to what a \"rich\" family can provide it's a relatively small amount. Sure, a rich family could withdraw support in order to \"score\" FAFSA funding for their kid (on someone else's dime), but in doing so they'd be guaranteeing that FAFSA funding was the only assistance their kid was getting. My guess is that most rich families who are already willing to throw money at their kids won't be willing to cut them off entirely over the amount of money FAFSA offers, especially with the amount of effort involved.\nIs all of this more work for FAFSA? Sure, but as you've mentioned it would probably only be necessary for a relatively limited number of cases.\nBasically, I'm not seeing a reason why FAFSA wouldn't be able to add some sort of exemption process for students receiving no familial support without compromising support for lower-class students. Sure, it might not be easy, but in a country the size of the U.S. the number of people who would benefit is far from insignificant.\n\nAnd that ladies and gentlemen is pretty much exactly what I'm after."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

There are many difficult points about living abroad, and absence of family is a big one. My dad was born to be a grandpa, but unfortunately he only gets to see his grandchild once or twice a year. I do not take lightly the grueling effort to bring my father and son together for a few weeks out of the year.\n\nI often hear people complain about those who bring small children on a plane. In fact, people don't merely complain, they make extreme statements about it (e.g. People who bring small children on planes are horrible people who deserve to have their children taken from them.).\n\nFirst off, the annoyance/discomfort of traveling with a small child is way more difficult for the parents than it is for anyone else on the flight. With that in mind, you can understand that they wouldn't be doing it unless the trip were very important. In many cases, the journey is undertaken to be with family living in different parts of the world. \n\nI understand that it's not fun to have to deal with a screaming child on board an airplane. However there are plenty of un-fun things about having to share this planet with other people. I wish that I didn't have to occupy the same earth as people who litter, or smoke cigarettes in public, or drive diesel, or vote for corrupt politicians, or give their money to corrupt businesses, etc...but I do. These inconveniences are something we all just have to deal with. \n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Instead, I want to argue that the free markets, advocated by most libertarians (and most notably, libertarian CEOs) would create a situation that they *themselves* would think of as \"unfair\".\n\nHere's the main argument against free markets: while companies are no longer constrained by (often inefficient) government rules, it allows for so-called \"slave wages\" and \"private corporate tyranny\", meaning that CEOs will have their employees working for the bare, absolute minimum.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" most Libertarians will say. \"A voluntary agreement can't be slavery. People have the choice to deny the job we offer.\"\n\nWhich is correct. But also a bit naive. People are prepared to work very hard for very little. Corporations know this, and it would be very difficult indeed to find a job *anywhere* where the employer would be kind enough to provide more than the bare minimum. Yes, it will be voluntary. But will that make it any less cruel?\n\nBut that's not my problem with libertarianism. (seeing as you can argue that the benefits will outway the costs, people will somehow unanimously refuse the lowest wages, etc.) **My main point is that Libertarianism is contradictory.** And here's why: the government is, fundamentally, no different from a corporation providing services. Only here, the services are police forces, roads, health care, and all in all, *society itself.* (There is only one real difference, and that is that in a democratic government, citizens can elect their \"CEOs\")\n\nIf you, as a CEO, don't like the rules and taxes the government asks in return for allowing you to use its services, you should just move your corporation to a different country. Or start your own. But of course you won't do that, because you lack the resources, or because you *need* the benefits of your country for keeping your corporation alive. Why, it's not a choice at all! \n\nWell, welcome to the situation of a labourer faced with a free market. You have a choice. Kind of. Only it's not a choice at all. \n\nIf you truly consider this sort of \"voluntary\" interaction fair, then you must also accept that you have no right to complain about the current status quo. And if you think it is \"unfair\", then you necessarily also deem the basics of a free market itself \"unfair\". Therein, I think, lies the contradiction of Libertarianism.

CMV. + \n + Alright, I think it's time that I had a proper discussion about this. **I firmly believe that the decision to move Iraq, the Middle East, and the region into a post-Saddam Hussein era was a moral and legal imperative for the United States and the international community and that force of arms was the only feasible way to accomplish that.** That's my position, in a sentence. I hope the post title doesn't misrepresent that.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1) There are four reasons for which a sovereign state may lose or sacrifice its sovereignty under international law.\n\n* It has invaded or occupied a neighboring state.\n* It has violated or proposed to violate the Genocide Convention\n* It has displayed promiscuous and frivolous behavior with (or plainly violated) the Non-Proliferation Treaty\n* It has actively harbored internationally wanted terrorists and gangsters\n\nIraq is the only modern state to have violated all four of those. It had attempted to annex Kuwait and make it part of Iraq, as well as engage in a pointless border dispute with Iran that cost thousands of lives. Saddam had issued a direct order to exterminate the Kurdish people of Iraq. He did this using biological and chemical weapons. Further, he maintained a department of state for the concealment of nuclear weapons. Although none were found during the invasion, he had stated that he wished to rebuild the nuclear program once the sanctions ceased. Finally, his country was the homebase of Abu-Nidal, Zarqawi, and the Achille Lauro hijackers from the PLF. \n\nThis meant that the international community had a duty, as well as a right, to remove the regime from power by any justifiable means, including and up to use of deadly force.\n\n2) Saddam Hussein and his crime family had sole ownership of all of the natural resources and imports to Iraq. The sanctions were in effect because he was able to use his power to keep the Iraqi people in his jaws, while they starved. Furthermore, he was in possession of some of the largest oil reserves in the world. He was able to do as he liked with them, and he was the sole profiteer of them. This was, in my opinion, an outrageous offense to anyone who cared about the economic well-being of both the country and the Middle East as a whole.\n\n3) Saddam Hussein only ever called a cabinet meeting when he ordered one half of the cabinet to shoot the other half, sealing them in complicity with his regime. A person could be publicly executed for spilling their coffee on the newspaper that had Saddam's face on it, after which the person's family would be billed for the bullets. People died horrible deaths every day for no other reason than the egotistical glorification of a known psychopath and criminal. Morally, an international community that had any regard for decency could not stand by while this regime behaved like that.\n\nNote: this is **not** an endorsement of the Bush administration. I believe wholly that their execution of the war was abysmal. Their reasons as stated to the American electorate were appallingly cheap and demagogic. They didn't level with us on any of the goings-on in the war while it was happening. They may have even committed a war crime or two. But, that isn't what this question is about.\n\nThis question is not about 9/11. My case would have been exactly the same in 1998 (with the exception of Zarqawi, I believe). In fact, it would have been almost complete during the Kuwait War. This question is not about mistakes that were made. It's solely about whether we, as citizens of a global community, were willing to stand by with our guns holstered while our Iraqi brothers and sisters were under the control of the Saddam Hussein regime.\n\nCMV.\n\n\n1) Some of you guys have had the best arguments I've yet heard against my position. Definitely the best on reddit. I'm gonna keep coming back here, for sure, and not just for my own post. Thank you, sincerely, and keep them coming.\n\n2) Having said that, I feel the need to make something abundantly clear: my contention is not \"America has made nothing but good foreign policy decisions ever since the Declaration\". It's also not \"Bush did the right thing during his execution of the war\". It's also not \"Bush Sr. was right\". It's also not \"Bush Sr. was wrong\". It's not \"X politician made Y statement and that proves me right\". I'm very deliberately **making my own case**, separate from any case anybody else made. I'm serious: if I get one more post that starts with \"BUT BUSH SAID...\" I'm going to go all Bane-backbreaker on my laptop.\n\n3) But seriously, keep it up.\n\n4) &lt;3\n\n5) Also, I'm going to bed right now. It's midnight here in the Philippines and I need sleep. If you leave a response, I'll answer it sometime tomorrow. Scout's honor."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It had to carry more weight than the other movies.\n\n* Scarecrow and Ras Al Ghul were great reflections of Batman's struggles. Scarecrow is a reflection of Bruce Wayne's mental obsessions (much like the Joker is a reflection as well) and Ras al Ghul is a reflection of Wayne's physical and martial obsessions.\n\n* The nightmarish Gotham city at the end is a great climax and fit into the story well, showing Scarecrow to be more powerful than he appears. \n\n**Dark Knight** is a great movie but I think far too long for what it was. \n\n* The reason so many people like it is because Heath Ledger, who did an amazing job as The Joker. Otherwise it is muddled. \n\n* The whole part of the boat where the prisoners could have blown up a boat of civilians was hamfisted and slowed the movie down. It was meant to make the movie suspenseful and show the ethics of The Joker but instead it made him look incompetent. Let's not even get into the cell phone tapping that just muddled the movie more. \n\n* Two Face, a great character, done very well by Aaron Eckhart was underused and just an object to continue the story. He didn't really stand on his own. \n\n* Replacing the girlfriend role also detracted from the movie.\n\n**Dark Knight Rises** another good movie and finished it.\n\n* Had a lot to live up to after Dark Knight, a movie people have talked about like it was Citizen Kane.\n\n* *Bane's voice.* Great look for Bane but his voice just ruined it.\n\n* It would be difficult to show the entire Knightfall storyline in one movie and though a lot was left out they did pretty well.\n\nThis is not a comparison of Batman's villains or who is better or worse, but a comparison of all three movies.

However, addicts that I have spoken to are very set in their beliefs that they have no choice but to use drugs. I can't help but feel that using this definition allows many addicts to use this as an excuse to deny personal responsibility, which would ultimately do a disservice to recovering addicts. Can someone please explain why these types of terms (disease of the brain, powerless) are used in the classification and treatment of addiction? \n\nI am specifically looking for physical evidence. Is it possible to diagnose someone as an addict through a brain scan? Is it possible to reliably differentiate a casual drug user and a \"diseased\" individual through a physical test? Can this also be applied to things like sex and gambling addiction?\n\nI am trying very hard to be sympathetic to addicts because I honestly can't put myself in their mindset. Still, I don't believe that addicts are anywhere near powerless to overcome their affliction, the same way someone with diabetes is helplessly unable to produce insulin.\n\nIt also occurs to me that there may be a chunk of dishonest addicts who are only latching so hard to the 'disease' explanation in order to get what they need out of their families and friends.

Because of this, I find these explicit additions to be redundant and simply add more complexity to an already excessively verbose legal system. Furthermore, defining laws that explicitly prohibit specific behavior, there is an implicit endorsement of behavior *not* itemized by these laws. In other words, by legally defining simultaneous texting and driving as illegal, there is an implicit suggestion that anything else not also directly identified is somehow permissible.

It's designed to allow people who view elective abortion as murder to avoid paying for it through their insurance premiums.  If somebody doesn't view abortion as murder, and feels that it would be an appropriate option in any situation, then they have the ability to pay for the right to end that life by purchasing the separate rider.\n\nMy belief is centered on the opinion that a fetus is an individual human being with the inalienable right to life regardless of the mother's desire.  \n\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}
