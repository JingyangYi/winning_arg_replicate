When there are leftovers from dinners with guests, etc. I'll eat that (throwing meat away is definitely worse than eating it). I try to do as much as I can for the environment and animals, I have very little money so I do not donate to animal rights organizations but I certainly would if I could.\n\nI'm trying to be as reasonable as possible on the subject, I try not to see individuals as evil 'cause they think it's normal to torture animals, I understand it's a cultural thing although I loathe humanity in general.\n\nI also think the hypothetical contribution of even a billion of the strictest vegans imaginable wouldn't change things a bit.\n\nAs of today I'm making this choice exclusively because it makes me feel good / at peace with myself, 'cause if I think about the contribution to the environment, I'm sorry but I just can't believe I'm doing anything significant.\n\nI'm 100% convinced on what I've done for a year now, and I'll become as \"vegan\" as possible in the future (I hate this whole \"vegan\" thing, it should be something natural like being against slavery), I'm NOT looking for an excuse to quit. But I know it'll only benefit my ethics and my self-esteem.\n\nI know that for every person like me (and I'm nowhere near good) there are one thousand who don't give a damn. I know that there are TENS OF BILLIONS animals being tortured for food, and unless the world miraculously turns vegan overnight, there's no chance any of this will change. Change my view.\n\nOn the eating leftovers thing, I also have to add.. I've been to a wedding recently and I got vegetarian courses, it was really no hassle for anyone... but I looked at the courses with fish and meat and I just thought of all the stuff they'd be throwing away that day... if I ate meat and fish that day it would have made NO difference at all... maybe it would have been better, saved the cook some work...\n\nFor me the key point is not BUYING meat rather than not eating it, I get it, and having vegetarian stuff served that day and making things look positive for everyone and having conversations with others about being vegetarian was a positive thing... but the actual contribution to things? That restaurant probably threw away ten times what I could have eaten. It's depressing.\n\nI still recommend that people switch to a vegetarian (or vegan) lifestyle, I think it's a GOOD thing by all means. It's a fantastic feeling, it's healthy, and a million other things. As I said I haven't stopped believing in the lifestyle and I'll never quit. I just believe the actual contribution to the environment and the well being of animals is insignificant, and expecting results is hopeless.\n\n**I have found a convincing argument and I think that made me change my mind. Although many answers were backed up by very uplifting data, I couldn't justify changing my mind since I couldn't help but believe things are changing way too slowly, and that the damage might still be irreparable in the long run.**\n\n\nI have never thought about critical mass. I still believe the situation is a lot more complex than just the West, but even believing that one day a relatively sudden change could happen like it did with LGBT rights based on public opinion reaching critical mass makes me believe there's something to look for behind the hard numbers.\n\n**Another great argument with links**\n\n[Does Veganism Make a Difference?](http://www.animalliberationfront.com/Philosophy/Utilitarianism/Does%20Veganism%20Make%20a%20Difference.htm)  \n[Expected Utility, Contributory Causation, and Vegetarianism](http://www.veganoutreach.org/enewsletter/thresholds.pdf)  \nBoth of these essays approach your question in a statistics-based manner that focuses on thresholds. They propose that your effect on meat production is a measurable probability.  \nIn other words, they ask questions like, \"What are the odds that your purchase of, say, a frozen turkey will be the one that causes your grocery store to order another entire shipment of frozen turkeys? And that that shipment causes the food distributor to order more turkeys? And that that shipment causes a farm to slaughter more turkeys?\"\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nI agree with /u/huadpe that simply the act of being vegetarian/vegan makes it easier for other people to reduce their meat consumption, because as the population of vegetarians and vegans expands, restaurants are offering more and better vegetarian/vegan options, including some that are so tasty only the most rabid carnivores would turn their nose up at them. The growing number of people with vegetarian/vegan friends and family members also means that more people are being exposed to delicious vegetarian/vegan food and even learning how to cook it, all of which chips away at the all-too-common notion that any meal without meat isn't worth eating.\n\nHelping society at large reduce its meat consumption is really important because meat production has such an enormous environmental impact, especially with regard to climate change. The exact contribution of animal agriculture to climate change is disputed, but the most widely accepted statistics seem to put animal agriculture at about 15-25% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, with some estimates reaching as high as nearly 50%. While it certainly is possible to raise meat in a sustainable and environmentally healthy way, in practice 78% of beef, 95% of pork, and 99% of chicken is raised in factory farms, so getting people to eat less meat overall is very important. Even a 10% reduction in overall meat consumption could make a significant difference. According to the Earth Day Network, if everybody in the U.S. did not eat meat or cheese for just one day a week, it would be the equivalent of not driving 91 billion miles. (I'm not sure how that figure was calculated, but if it's even close to correct, it demonstrates the kind of difference skipping meat just three meals a week could make.)\nSecond Reply:\nIn short, the reality is: It adds up.\n\n[Does Veganism Make a Difference?](http://www.animalliberationfront.com/Philosophy/Utilitarianism/Does%20Veganism%20Make%20a%20Difference.htm)\n\n[Expected Utility, Contributory Causation, and Vegetarianism](http://www.veganoutreach.org/enewsletter/thresholds.pdf)\n\nBoth of these essays approach your question in a statistics-based manner that focuses on thresholds.

And in my opinion, that's significant.\n\nThink of it this way: If the odds of you saving one animal are the same as the odds of you winning the lottery (say, one in 200 million), being a vegetarian is like entering that lottery a billion times."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

From what I've heard of them they're all great countries to live in. The big thing for me is the weather and the scenery, I love cold weather and I've seen so many beautiful pictures of the forests and towns there. I'm wondering if I'm being stupid and I should just give this up because Scandinavia isn't all flowers and smiles like I think it is.\n\nFirst Reply:\nI'm Danish. My workplace has roughly 60% foreigners from all over the world, except Africa and the middle east - not because they won't hire them, but because we get 0 applications, probably because its a tech company and people from there don't have the qualifications.\n\nSo, I know second hand from them what it's like coming here from different places in the world. Basically, the more Danish you look and act, the easier a time you will have. \n\nYou will face stigmatization if you are from Eastern Europe, since they have a bad rep among a lot of Danes, due to a lot of home robberies and burglaries committed by Eastern Europeans.\n\nIf you are black you stand out a lot, and will face a lot of fear from people, and in return sometimes being treated \"with caution\". The same probably goes, albeit to a lesser degree, if you look like you are from the middle east.\n\nIf you are American you will face some prejudices that you might be arrogant and stupid. Generally, those prejudices only come from stupid people.\n\nNot speaking Danish is not a problem if you decide to live in one of the larger cities. Danes generally do not mind speaking English, but older people in the smaller cities often have a view that if you move here, it's disrespectful not to learn the language. \n\nYou will pay a high tax. The more you earn, the higher a tax percentage. If you earn below 250.000 DKK a year, you pay 38% in tax. (These numbers are from memory, could be slightly different now). \n\nAll schooling is free, even University. You can get money to live for while studying, around 5.000 DKK a month for up to 6 years if you don't live with your parents.\n\nAll medicare is free, except dentists.\nSecond Reply:\nIf you want cold and forests, I'd suggest Canada instead.  Since it's clear you speak English, it also has the advantage of not having to learn a new language, and because US and (English) Canadian cultures are so similar, there will be very little \"outsider\" problem relatively speaking.  \n\nAdditionally, it's probably substantially easier to move there (if you get a bachelors you can probably move temporarily under a TN visa to try it out), and there are some other perks as well such as your Canada Pension Plan payments counting towards Social Security and vice versa.\n\nIf you want a more \"foreign\" experience than you'll get in the English speaking parts of Canada, you can also drive over to Quebec and spend some time there.  Quebec is much more different from the rest of Canada than any part of the US is different from any other part."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I admit there can be other reasons to vote--social pressure, solidarity, civic pride, etc.  But on a practical level, I can reasonably expect no difference between the world in which I vote and the world in which I stay home, except that in the former I'd have to go out of my way to perform additional actions.  If I'm trying to decide whether to perform those actions, based on pure self-interest, there is no reason for me to vote.  I'm setting this at the level of national elections (specifically thinking of U.S. elections) because it's true that, given a small enough \"nation,\" your individual vote would carry a significant probability of making a difference.  \n\nThis is a classic example of a [collective action problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action), and after considering this class of problems thoroughly, I've come to the conclusion that there is no self-interested practical reason to participate in these cases, barring external motivators (such as added incentives).\n\nIt would be nice to find a reason to believe this isn't a case, so I look forward to someone convincing me!\nFirst Reply:\nJust because it's incredibly unlikely that your vote will make a difference doesn't mean it's never going to happen. Suppose a state like Wyoming (voter turnout of 249,000 last general election) was polling 50/50 (or 47/47, or 43/43, etc.) going into the election. A Wyomingite could guess there's a thousand or so votes separating the candidates at most, and determine that these odds are worth the minimal investment required to make the trip to the voting booths.\n\nAnd it's not like this is purely theoretical either - there have been a few examples of state elections being decided by only a couple hundreds of votes. A 1974 Senate election (223,000 votes) in New Hampshire was decided by **2** votes only. Maybe sooner or later it'll be decided by one.\nSecond Reply:\nThe same ballot for Presidential and Congressional elections will also have a number of other state and local positions and issues that are up for vote, many of which your vote would be significant (only 1000s or even 100s of voters).  For example, during the last Presidential election, there was a ballot initiative to merge the town next to mine that failed to pass, 72-72 votes.\n\nWhile it might not make sense to go out of your way just to vote for those elections in which your vote is insignificant, it does make sense if you are already there to vote for things where your vote is significant.  Then you are putting in a very low amount of effort for a very low amount of impact.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I will not give up easily.\nI believe I can change this country, better yet, this world for the better. The whole idea behind what I am about to say relates back to evolution. Humans do not allow evolution to take place properly. We save the weak. I personally believe that we should execute the weak. yes, this sounds harsh but let me explain why. We are not advancing as a race. For now though, we will keep it to America for the sake of the argument and hope the rest of the world catches on. Another massive problem we are facing is over population, we are using our resources and producing waste and pollution and mind blowing rates.\nYou look at animals and if an animal doesn't want to eat, it dies, if a human doesn't want to eat, it has an eating disorder and is treated for the disorder. More importantly that human is allowed to procreate. We allow shitty genetics to be passed on. We SAVE the WEAK. We also allow these morbidly obese, incredibly stupid people live and breed. If an animal in the wild isn't fit, or cannot attract a mate, it will die and or be unable to pass on its genetics. Humans may be fat and physically repulsive but if they have money they can still get women and still have children, which fucks with the gene pool. I could go on for longer in this section but if more reasoning is necessary i'll continue on later.\nNow to determine who is to be executed. The type of people i want to execute are people who are not able to make a contribution to society. If you weigh 500 pounds but you're incredibly smart, you can still make a contribution to society. The opposite is also true, if you're borderline retarded but you're very physically fit, you can also contribute to society. People who are mentally unstable shall also be executed as we wouldn't want their genetics passed on and they are a threat to the gene pool we are creating.\nWhat will determine who is executed: At the age of 14 years old, annual testing will begin based on birthday. There will be three tests, a mental test, a physical test, and a psychological test. Your Mental test exactly 3 months after your birthday and your physical test 9 months after your birthday. Tests will vary depending on your age, the older you get the harder they become, until the age of 20 where they will remain the same until 35 and gradually work their way down until the age of 65 where no further testing will be required. At the age of 20 we will also introduce psychological testing which will continue until the age of 65.\nWhat the tests will consist of: The mental test will be a basic evaluation of your ability to do math, your ability to read and write, and your basic understanding of the sciences. This test should not be difficult, anyone who has at least a D average in school should be just fine. For the physical test, every age group will be required to complete a mile in 16 minutes. This is a very easy time to make, you can walk that pace. Physical tests will include varying push up or sit up tests depending on age group. There may be a few other exercises required in certain age groups, and the amount of repetitions will also vary depending on age. this should be easy for anyone who isn't morbidly obese. Next is the psychological test. These will be administered every 5 years to insure mental stability and health of everyone. We want the mental health of our gene pool to be good as well. Lastly, there will be certain ways to be omitted to testing, ALL WILL BE FROM SOME SORT OF SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY, the main one being in the military. If you served in the military without being dishonorably discharged, you will be exempt from any further testing in your lifetime. Another example of a way to be omitted from testing is by paying for it. The cost will be $25,000 per year, per person. Many will be angry that it's giving more power to the rich, but i see it as a valid way of determining someones potential for making a contribution to society. If you are rich, I will almost guarantee you are either physically fit enough or mentally fit enough to pass the tests and you would have been fine anyway. AN IMPORTANT NOTE: You will only have to pass 2 out of 3 tests.\nHow we will execute people: We will set up an organization in charge of carrying out testing and executing people. My idea is to possibly have the military be in charge of this, though I haven't had the time to think too much into that, this I am very open to other ideas on. The method of execution i think will be best is the firing squad. 8 men, 2 with real bullets to ensure death, 6 with blanks for the obvious reason. For those who are unaware, my understanding is that firing squads use primarily blanks so the gunmen aren't aware of who actually killed the person so they don't have trouble with living life after killing someone.\nNow another thing i would like to do that isn't executing people, but will improve our gene pool is preventing certain people from having children. People with MORE THAN two generations of diagnosed cancer or potentially terminal illnesses that tend to be passed on genetically will be sterilized. These people will not be allowed to produce offspring, however we will make it easy for them to adopt if they would like to have children.\nI would also like to place a limit on the amount of children a person may have. The maximum number of children a person may have is 3, which is a very reasonable amount. It should slow the rate of population increase or possibly make the population decrease due to some couples not having children or only having 1 child. There is no reason to have more than 3 children because at that point you're just putting a burden on society. If say you already have 2 children and you would like to have a third but you end up with twins, triplets, or even more, you will be allowed to keep them as it wasn't your intent to have that many. When you hit the limit for children you will be sterilized.\nThis is all i can think of for now, if i remember more of my plan i will post. So reddit users, change my view.\nFirst Reply:\nYou are complaining about humans not letting evolution take place (I'll come to that too), but at the same time you want to counteract what humans evolved to become - supportive of the weak.\n\nThe fact that humans help each other out and save the weak (first in tribes, now in nation states) allowed humans to take over the world. You help me now that I'm weak, I help you another time when you're weak. We both survive, instead of neither of us surviving. Remember, it's survival of the fittest, and fittest doesn't necessarily mean strongest.\n\nNow, I don't see how we're not letting evolution take place. Evolution doesn't mean that in every generation only the strongest are allowed to survive. Evolution means that the genes which are most likely to survive through multiple generations in bodies that are likely to reproduce are likely to be spread the most. So if being determined enough to acquire sufficient wealth to be able to reproduce even if you are fat means that you are more likely to reproduce, then that means that that's a gene that's likely to spread, and that's evolution.\n\nAnd if you really want to solve overpopulation problems, there's far less radical ways to solve that (development help for third world countries etc.). Or just kill everyone who is too old to reproduce.\nSecond Reply:\nI could write two dozen things in opposition to this, but just to gather a few basic points.\n\n-You should understand, if you don't(seems like you don't), that what you're referring is [eugenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics), a field of thought that has existed for about as long as Darwin's theory of evolution has has a long, *very* sordid history.  Most notably, it was one of the primary justifications for Nazi Germany's genocidal practices.\n\n-Despite it's attractiveness to certain political persuasions, [overpopulation is simply not a concern with legitimate scientific backing](https://www.pop.org/content/debunking-myth-overpopulation).  In fact, if the world continues to increase on its path of modernization, democratization and secularism, *under*population is the issue we will have to be concerned.  In highly educated, relatively prosperous societies, birth rates become lower and lower, to the point where they are now beginning to become lower than death rates in some places.  In America, if you excluded immigration, the population would not be growing.  In Japan, it's shrinking and aging outright.  It's only because of the poorer places in the world that population continues to grow substantially, and even then, the worldwide birth rate is shrinking slowly every year.\n\n-There are any number of political oppositions I have to this but I won't get to deep into them as ultimately that's my ethical viewpoint vs. yours.  Needless to say, I think measuring the value of a human being wholly by their ability to produce and work for their country is a fascist viewpoint, and the ability of an individual to pass any kind of mental or psychological test(which undoubtedly would be designed by rich white people) is strongly dependent on the situation and opportunities they grew up with, so it doesn't even remotely approach an accurate genetic test."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

That's all the pronouns you are getting.\nMy proposition is that pronouns past the three most common ones are not necessary and are actively harmful. An example for some of the new pronouns that can be encountered in the wild is \"xe/xer/xerself\" or \"zi/zis/zimself\". My argument is as follows:\n\n1. Pronouns are always dealing with a spectrum. A \"he\" can be used to describe both masculine as well as feminine men and similarly for she and women. The singular they is also covering a spectrum, the spectrum of all people that do not identify with either gender or those that identify with both to differing degrees. Therefore they is sufficient to describe alternative gender identities.\n2. If we'd decide that new pronouns are necessary to describe or be inclusive to specific non-standard gender identities, we would very likely end up with a sheer infinite amount of pronouns. Since the argument for further pronouns would not be based on scientific facts but rather on feelings of individual people, the argument why some new pronouns are okay and others aren't would be a very difficult one to make. The result would be that we would have to allow anyone to pick or create their own pronouns.\n3. Since we'd have a large number of new pronouns people would very likely get confused, since they'd not only have to remember a name and a face but also the specific pronouns of a person AND incorporate those into everyday speech. The result would either be that people would start inadvertently giving offence or our speech patterns would change to rely far more on using names instead of pronouns. \n4. Having a wide range of new pronouns would actively harm the English language by making it less clear. Encountering unknown pronouns would confuse people and make it difficult to imagine what kind of character is being talked about.\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nSo...  I'm your target demographic here.  I'm MtF trans, but identify as non-binary.  I don't need a specific pronoun to describe my particular place on the gender spectrum; I'd agree that would be ridiculous--not because non-standard gender identities are ridiculous, but simply because of the way language works (that the meaning of a word must be known by both parties ub advance for a word to be useful in itself).  HOWEVER...\n\nIt would be nice to have a _singular_ gender-neutral pronoun instead of \"they.\"  They is linguistically awkward because it's plural.  When I first came out, I decided to ask people to just use _she_, and one of the reasons for this is because there is no singular gender-neutral pronoun.  I agree that the proliferation of them is a problem, for me because it makes the adoption of one that's actually useful from a language perspective less likely.\n\nI agree it's quite unlikely in the short term because we haven't settled on ___ONE___ of xe/ze/hir/etc... to describe non-binary gender identities.  But it certainly would be nice if it were possible in the long term (i.e., 30-50 yrs).\nSecond Reply:\nA new single, gender-neutral pronoun could be introduced without falling into all of those traps that you describe. After all, \"they\" already basically fills this role, but some argue this is incorrect, and even if correct it is potentially confusing because that word can also be used as a plural pronoun. Simply replace \"they\" with \"whateverthefuckyouwant\" and all those problems are avoided.\n\nPersonally, I think gender-neutral singular \"they\" is perfectly fine, and trying to forcibly shoe-horn in another pronoun is pretty doomed to failure, because language isn't really a top-down process like that, but much more organic. But if it did happen slowly over time because people wanted a more unambiguous gender-neutral third person singular, it could happen without causing problems."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The best I could articulate it is that he is the most populist candidate out, his politics are moderate but heavily nationalist, his demeanor is one of our idealized archetypes, and he is wealthy but appears genuine, achieving a halo effect (unlike Romney.)  \n\nAfter realizing this, I asked several other people, and realized that basically my friends, like Clinton, don't like how he communicates, but then have no major disagreement with the content.\n\nAm I missing something?  Is there a good reason to dismiss him as a candidate?  More importantly, who is real competition for him?\n\nFrom todays conversations:\nI see an argument for why he may not have a good chance in an election (delta awarded), mainly in that whatever percentage of his 25% popularity is republican is all he may get from the republicans, and as a more mainstream candidate arises, the split votes wont go to him (that is, the people who polled for him may be all that would poll for him in the primary, given any other more mainstream republican candidate.\n\nHowever, I have seen no compelling argument for why he is not a populist candidate.  Some have tried to narrow the definition of a populist to being representative of a position or policies that in some fashion clearly serve the underserve or/and the majority, but this is difficult to define, and ignores the perception.  One person argued at length that the self perception of the constituency as victim and the candidate's policy being to address that sense of victimization is what makes them populist, and while I can agree that it is a fine definition, the person then asserts that this is not trump, and I disagree, as Trump clearly paints the American people as victimized by poor, self interested leadership, a corrupt political culture, and compromised ideas and strategies, and his entire platform is about going in as a normal private citizen and fixing it.\n\nMany (most?) have simply tried to argue that he is too insulting to win, but I remain unconvinced that that would stop a sizable percentage of Americans from voting for him.  This is because Americans don't actually value formality and decorum as much as power and conviction.  For the same reason that this is the America we have, I can't see how a candidate, fundamentally in favor of current nationalist policies, but simultaneously harping on being free from big money interests and the many leadership deficits that are frustrating Americans, isn't hitting so many of the right cords with mainstream America.\n\nIf he sticks to a policy (rather than sentiment,) that is antithetical to a group, then another would be preferred by that group.  But a career politician vs Trump, both speaking in vagaries, I see Trump coming out on top rather consistently.  (Saw a headline today, Trump took a hit in polls for being in favor of higher taxes, this looks like an example of the very thing.)\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nWe're at an extremely polarized point in our nation's history and I think a lot of the dismissal comes from the fact that he's simply in the \"other\" party.  Democrats have branded him racist, sexist, etc. but is there a Republican they're not *also* branding as those things?  \n\nTrump gets an extra heap of dismissal because he's also not exactly a Republican either.  There are a lot of people in the party who have a strong interest in making sure an outsider doesn't take the reigns. \n\nI think Jeb Bush is still his biggest competition overall.  Trump is the front runner because ridiculously early polling has him ahead but polling this early is notoriously unreliable and campaigning hasn't really started yet.  He's going to have to come up with a platform at some point to run on.\n\nI wouldn't exactly call him a populist.  He certainly says some things some people want to hear but I think it's probably more accurate to call him the candidate for those fed up with career politicians.  Trumped up controversial statements have made headlines but I think his man attraction still is that he's an extremely successful businessman and not a guy who ran for his father's Senate seat 40 years ago. \nSecond Reply:\nTrump likes making wild pronouncements.   He doesn't care if he comes across as abrasive or bigoted.    He also doesn't care if what he proposes makes any sense (building a Mexican wall and making Mexico pay for it, for instance).\n\nThere are some who find this outspokenness appealing (such as those who liked Sarah Palin).\n\nBut his problem is that he doesn't appeal to enough Republicans to get the nomination.  The Christian Right doesn't think he's really Christian (because, well, he isn't).  The Tea Partiers don't think he's really their guy either (because he isn't).  The mainstreamers don't think he's mainstream (because he isn't).  \n\nAt the end of the day, he might draw enough to be a spoiler in some early races (and maybe win a plurality), but once the other vote splitters drop out, a Jeb Bush or Scott Walker will appeal a lot more to primary voters.\n\nThe biggest scare for Repubs is whether he'll run as a 3rd party candidate.  In that case, he'll get enough votes to ensure a win by the Dems."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The result of this was that dungeons weren't very dangerous: you could always choose to walk out safely if things got too hot, and you could always push forwards to see if you were at the end and then make a decision if you saw monsters in the way.  Older console RPGs had more of a sense of tension: the awareness that you might be ambushed made dungeons in Dragon Warrior or Phantasy Star feel like very dangerous places, and you felt really accomplished if you managed to clear one out and escape with your life.\n\nAlso, games like Paper Mario and Final Fantasy Mystic Quest can use this sort of visible enemy system because they have no overworlds.  Monsters could be set up in bottlenecks in dungeons, but on the overworld there would be no way to force confrontations since you could walk around any enemy you see.  That would completely remove overworld exploration as a mechanic, since there's no danger in exploring if you're certain you'll never be attacked.\nSecond Reply:\nhttp://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/221-rpgs-square-enix/61428436\n\nA number of people who like gambling note that they enjoy that sort of mechanic. You personally don't like them, but if others like gambling who are you to stop them?\n\n&gt;I also LOVE random encounters. For a lazy gambling man like me who doesn't want to have to use strategy when picking my battles, they are a godsend. Also for grinding, because in FFXII etc, once you've cleared out the area, you have to go a certain amount of screens away for them to respawn, where with random encounters, you can just run around. Even when I'm low on HP/MP/Items, it keeps me on the edge of my seat, wondering whether I'll make it out alive.\n\nThe items issues and the lack of ability to avoid them makes it more fun for some people."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Squatting is more comfortable, easier and healthier than sitting. it creates less stress on the the puborectalis muscle allowing for a smoother uninterrupted experience. it plays well with gravity so less pressure is needed and lowers the risk of cancer and other ailments.\n\n2. Toilet paper is messy, expensive and damages the environment. When washed properly the use of your hand is preferable to toilet paper, It might sound disgusting but when you think about it using a thin piece of frail paper to smear around fecal matter with no water or soap is even worse. \n\n3. Modern europen toilets are large, bulky and complex. They take more space, require more maintenance and are ultimately dirtier as butts keep touching them.  \n\n\nFirst Reply:\n1) This may be true, but there is no evidence that I am aware of that supports any of your claims. Also, cancer? Really? That sounds almost like a joke: \"I squat when I poop so I won't get cancer!\"\n\n2) Soap and other cleaning materials also have costs associated with them. The cleanliness bonus is marginal for people who shower daily. You'll need to use more water too to wash up. Are you sure that this is really a plus? \n\n3) They are also a great way to dispose of waste: it has to go somewhere, it can be toxic to plants, and toilets take up a negligibly larger amount of space than a bucket, which then requires 'maintenance' every time it needs emptied. Butts are also, with the exception of the asshole itself, [probably the cleanest part of our bodies.](http://health.thefuntimesguide.com/2006/08/dirtytoiletseat.php) They're always covered and we rarely directly touch anything with them; why would they be unclean?\n\n\nSecond Reply:\n1.) I will concede that on a biological level, squatting is the \"default\" position so our biology and anatomy generally works better in that position. \n\n2.) Toilet paper is a shield that, hopefully, keeps your hand and any small cuts, or splits cleaner and less prone to nasty infections. It does, as other commentators have said, keep feces out from underneath your fingernails. The associated costs of water usage, soap also affect the environment. (Though it must be noted that you still SHOULD wash your hands after pooing it just takes less if your not scrubbing last nights dinner off your hand.) \n\n3.) Bulky, dirty, and in need of maintenance I will give you. However, if we are talking about a toilet in a home cleanliness should be part of the necessary routine that would be needed if you had say, a bucket and a floor level toilet system. The complexity in a toilet provides a way to shield sewer gasses from coming back up into the restroom. It's not a perfect system but it's better than up against a tree in the woods.

Regardless of who is to blame, we don't want to allow casinos to ruin people's lives like that. People are obviously stupid when drunk.\n\nNow, suppose you are a law maker. A number of women report that someone plied them with drinks, had drunk sex with them, and got HIV positive. A number report that they did that and foolishly agreed to lubeless anal sex and now have incontinence. A number of feminists report that their rape centers have a number of traumatized women who are depressed after drunken sex.

If they shift on these issues, its for emotional reasons. \n\nSure they'll have a few go-to facts or stats that are essentially cherry picked to support their view, or they may even be aware of the news, etc,(again to find info to support their position) but new evidence rarely changes people's minds.\n\nIf people did have beliefs based on evidence there'd be a greater diversity in the beliefs individuals held. As it is, if I know a person cares about climate change, odds are they are anti-gun rights and pro-choice. If they're big on border protection, they're gonna be small government and pro-gun rights. These are largely unrelated topics, yet at least 80% of the time people hold these 'suites' of ideas.\n\nPeople seldom shift on these big issues, because views aren't evidence based, they're ideological. The few times people do change its because of one of two reasons.\n\nAn overall change in societal norms on the issue. Same sex marriage is a good example of this. This wasn't even on the agenda 20 years ago. There has been little 'data' to change peoples minds; we've just had a kind of cultural shift, and now its broadly accepted. It wasn't data or evidence that changed people's minds, it was a change in societies norms.\n\nThe other thing which I believe *can* change folks' minds is personal experience/change. I've known people to retire, or have  a health crisis, which shakes up their whole outlook, including views on ''the big issues. Or perhaps a personal brush with an issue-\"My son came out, now I'm pro-same sex marriage\"\n\nSo persuade me people are actually rational, and can be convinced by actual facts-CMV\n\n\n[\"evidence\" in this context means objective stats or data, and doesn't include personal experience, or one emotionally affecting news event(e.g \"Sandy Hook really got to me, now I'm anti-guns\") ]\nFirst Reply:\nThis varies a lot based on what type of issue you are talking about.\n\nI'm surprised you used climate change to support your view - to me climate change is a clear example of evidence *clearly* driving people's views.  The climate change \"debate\" is politicians arguing over science, but the issue itself is a matter of scientists, and among credible scientists there isn't really a \"debate\" because the evidence all points solidly in one direction.  The arguments against climate change come largely from corporate interests and the politicians and \"scientists\" bought by corporate interests.  In other words, the scientific community largely agrees (based on the evidence) that climate change is a major challenge, and some politicians (who are not experts in climate science) have accused the entire scientific community of pulling some sort of scheme.  One side is motivated by desire to uncover the truth through experimentation and research (scientists) and the other is motivated by money from sponsors (politicians).  \n\nSecond Reply:\nAre your set of \"big issues\" specifically \"issues that are controversial/unresolved in 2015\", and your set of evidence specifically \"evidence that is available in 2015\"?  Because if so, you might imagine that the reason the issue is unresolved is because the fact pattern can be interpreted at least two ways.\n\nHow about some previous large issues?  \n\n*Evolution  (evidence resolved via science)\n\n*Empiricism vs innate knowledge (evidence resolved via science)\n\n*Heliocentric astronomy (evidence resolved via science)\n\n*Prohibition (evidence resolved via a grand societal experiment)\n\nI would disagree with your characterization of same sex marriage attitudes.  What happened was that the gay community made a conscious effort to encourage one another to \"come out\".  People suddenly had many more data points, and were thus able to generalize from something approximating [actual set of gay people] instead of from the very-skewed sample they'd previously known about.  They hadn't previously known that gay people were so normal because the normal gay people were mostly closeted.\n\n\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Assuming the worst case and a student pays full sticker price, that's around 125k in debt. But with almost all private schools, there are plentiful scholarship and grant opportunities. Even for students who support themselves (meaning no financial help from their parents), these options make the 125k number far less. This forgets the fact that according to the same source, students can attend an in-state university for just shy of 10,000, for a far more affordable (and worst case) of 40k. And this is without considering alternatives to college.\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nMy family made \"too much\" for FAFSA aide but too little to afford me much assistance with college prices.  I went to a school where I was given a full academic scholarship, which included room and board.  In order to afford additional fees / books / transportation I still had to take out a Stafford loan every yeah.  On top of that, the government decided that the room and board part of my scholarship qualified as \"income\", and I then owed the IRS money come tax return time for each of my four years.

We should let them go extinct.\nFirst off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are devoted to saving the panda because pandas are extremely well known and popular, not because they have a good chance of survival.   Here are the reasons I believe this:\n  \n1) Pandas have lost much of their natural habitat due to the population explosion in China.  While this is regrettable, it is not likely to get fixed anytime soon. This means that even if we are able to revive this species they won't have anywhere to live.   \n  \n2) pandas, as a species, have chosen poorly. They are carnivorous animals who's main diet is bamboo. Their digestion can only process about 5% of the stuff in bamboo. That means they have to eat huge amounts of bamboo everyday. With the reduced habitat this is getting harder and harder. Either they need some microevolutionary shift to eat more nutritious sources of food orthey should join the likes of the dodo bird.   \n  \n3) human efforts to revive the population have shown some increases, but at what cost? It is incredibly difficult to get pandas to mate with one another, it's like they don't even want their species to survive. I get they aren't actually making this choice, this is just a facetious way of saying that their instincts and biology do not support the kind of growth in population hey need. Hell, half of their births are twins and the mother almost always lets one die because she doesn't produce enough milk. I realize this would take evolution to fix and this problem is way too short term, but it means that their survival requires an exorbanant amount of human intervention. Since their is a finite amount of resources conservationists can dedicate to endangered resources they are killing other more likely to survive species.  \n  \n4) I'm not saying we should encourage the decline of the panda. We should still try to preserve what habitat they have left and ban hunting them, but they are so far gone and require so much help that we shouldnt waste too many resources on them. Let the panda try to support a small and natural population without our interference. If they cannot achieve this goal, I don't think it's worth the resources to help them grow.\nFirst Reply:\nI don't think it's a waste of money. In short, we conserve pandas because people like them. Whoever spends the money on keeping pandas around has already considered this, and he thinks it's worth it.\n\nMany other things, such as music and balloons could be considered a waste of resources if people didn't like them.\nSecond Reply:\npanda's is a test case to see if we could, lets face it with our current progress were gonna wipe out a species that we need one of these days, so its better to practice keeping something alive we could let die then to go straight to keeping something we need alive. the tools we learn from panda's and the errors give us new things to work with"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Hyper-rationality is the social expectation and pressure that every human action and institution must be teologically justified by rational means, rather than a mixture of reason, emotion, tradition, religion, evolutionary instinct etc. I will use one clear example, for the sake of focus, while knowing that there are other examples of this as well. I will talk about producing off-spring.\n\nIn my experience, people against procreating articulate 3-4 arguments against having children. Firstly, that having children will detrimentally affect the environment (1). New humans means more consumers of the Earth's resources and more producers of waste. The long term viability of the earth with exponentially more consumers and producers is uncertain.  Secondly, the cost of having children can be astronomical (2). Thirdly, you become isolated to your social circle and to your spouse due to the time need to take care of your child. \n\nI present these arguments not because they uniquely matter, but because they seem valid. They are, shall we say for the sake of argument, true.  However, in the pursuit of being rational, these arguments have contradicted one of the most basic and scientific principles of life, namely that animals produce off-spring to survive. It is basic evolutionary biology. We observe this in every known creature; we observe our own instincts to sexual activity and pleasure; we observe people's special fondness to babies (3). Yet, despite this obvious teology of humans, the rational arguments are given preference. This seems to play out on the societal level. Education levels and industrialization (a proxy for culture/rationality) correlate with lower birth rates (4). \n\nIn conclusion, this is but one of many examples where hyper-rationality creates a social pressure that contradicts human instinct. \n\n1. http://green.blogs.nytimes.com//2009/08/07/having-children-brings-high-carbon-impact/\n2. http://money.cnn.com/interactive/pf/cost-of-children/\n3. reddit.com/r/aww\n4. http://www.earth-policy.org/data_highlights/2011/highlights13\nFirst Reply:\nThere is a different between someone's proposed reasons for doing something and their actual reasons for doing something. A person who doesn't want to have a child might justify their decision with all the things you mentioned, but due to social pressure might fail to mention that they dislike children and that's why they're choosing not to have them. The other considerations like finances are just a plus. So, when you say that people have a special fondness for babies, you are not taking into account the fact that many people don't, or that there are other things they value far more highly (like a commitment to the environment that brings them fulfillment and purpose).\n\n...\n\nAs a source for the assertion above:  https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/3gif1d/ranimalaww_all_the_aww_none_of_the_kids/\n\nA relevant comment from the post: \n\n&gt;[\u2013]SickRosecats not brats! &gt;^..^&lt; 6 points 20 days ago \n\n&gt;Technically kids and babies are allowed on /r/aww, but they generally get downvoted to hell which I find kind of amusing. Once in a while kids can be cute or do cute things, but the newborn baby pictures are kind of gross.\n\n...\n\n\nI also suggest r/childfree for a celebration of people who are following their instincts by NOT having children. They are bucking a strong societal pressure to live their lives like they actually want to. Is this due to an increasingly rational society? Possibly. But they are not fighting their animal nature.\n\nThere is still a strong social pressure to procreate even if your circumstances make it an irrational choice, and you'll find examples of that on the subreddit. To say that higher education and industrialization (your rationality proxy) results in a lower birthrate because people are making a rational decision to not have children despite their desire to doesn't make much sense in light of Sweden. They put a lot of effort as a country into supporting parents and children http://www.oecd.org/els/family/swedenssupportforparentswithchildreniscomprehensiveandeffectivebutexpensive.htm\n\nyet they still have a birthrate comparable to developed nations that supply far less support to parents. http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN\n\n...\n\nRationality doesn't seem to be causing people to completely dismiss their emotional desire to have children in most cases. All of the other factors of emotion, tradition, religion, etc are still very much at play. Perhaps more people now value the environment more highly than religious doctrine in their decision to have children, but to say that people all people who choose not to have children for an environmental reason are contradicting their instinct to do so is demonstrably false.\n\nSecond Reply:\nI don't think the dropping fertility in the industrialized world is due to this \"hyper rationality\", because this \"hyper rationality\" doesn't seem to be manifesting in other domains.\n\nFor example, are humans even remotely rational when it comes to voting? Most seem to vote for whoever seems to be \"of their tribe\" (intellectuals, or go-getters, or soldiers or southerners, etc.) with very little analysis of policy. Or heck, just vote for whoever is tall and has a convincing smile, a nice suit, and a slogan with a couple feel-good words.\n\nOr how is watching dreck on TV \"hyper-rational\"? Or spending money on an impressive car or handbag, or doing drugs, or arguing with people on the internet, etc.?\n\nTo get back to the birth example, I think it can be explained perfectly well witjout \"hyper rationality\" - people respond to incentives, and the incentive in the modern world (especially in a city) are very different from those of most of our more fertile ancestors. Put in our shoes, they would probably also choose to have less kids, for the same reasons we do: contraception is available; living space is very expensive; education is expensive; women work; there are many more other things on which one is tempted to spend money; hardly anybody has a job at which kids can be of any help, etc."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Keynes predicted that as technology increased and our material needs would be met, we would only need to work 15 hours a week, instead we are working longer hours than ever.\nThere's no reason to think this will change anytime soon, if it hasn't in the last 80 years.\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/01/economics\n\nPeople were saying from the 18th Century that the industrial revolution will make man redundant? But did it? People moved on, new types of job openings which we'd never have imagined before came to be, think about the luddites' opposition to technology. We do not have anything to fear.\nFirst Reply:\nI'm getting a PhD in this now.  Over the next 20 years things will get crazy.  To look over the horizon, there's a few technologies that are just now coming together.\n\n * Cheap Sensors: 6 years ago I wanted to make an RC Segway.  I started on it, but you either had to hand build a sensor from cheaper ones or buy one pre-made for $600.  Now, those sensors are $2 a piece and come in cell phones.\n\n * Computing Power: For things like automatic cars you need a lot of fast processing power because you can't wait 5 seconds to figure out if you're about to crash.  Right now, things are just getting to the level where a $500 or so computer can do enough calculations to have something workable.\n\nThose 2 things will make a lot of people redundant.  It might be the biggest change society has ever experienced.  Robots building robots, driving everyone around and doing everything for us.  It'll change politics and how people view living life, but we'll have so much stuff it might be a lot better.\n\nFor the fear part, this changes war completely.  I think robotics is a WMD worse than atomic bombs.  Its hard to make atomic bombs, and countries can monitor each other, but anyone can download a program from the internet, load it into a robot, and turn it into an indiscriminate killing machine.\n\nIf you check out a video of a high powered quadcopter, then look at another of tricks people can make them do, the technology exists today for a small government or large group of people to make killing machines that could wipe out a city.  Right now, a country with a cell phone factory could convert it to make sniper drones by the thousands.  The only reason you we see it now is because governments like the US and China are more interested in technology that supports their troops in combat, which is more complex, instead of robotic ways to commit genocide.\nSecond Reply:\nThis is kind of an aside:\u00a0\n\n\nI think both sides of this argument are missing the point here (and I do agree with points on both sides). While I do think that it is possible for automation to replace the lion's share of modern jobs (I just watched a lecture yesterday where it was claimed that only ~20% of factory jobs were lost overseas whereas they discovered in retrospect that almost ~80% were lost due to automation), I also think economists opposing this view have a good point when they say that we can create new jobs, ones that we can't even imagine today, to keep the majority of people employed to the same degree as today.\n\n\nThat said, I think there are two *very important* factors missing from this discussion:\u00a0\n\n\n1) The inherent value of a newly created jobs compared to past jobs, and\n\n2) Our economic system's ability to accommodate accelerating technological change in terms of employment\n\n\nRegarding the first point, people tend to become disillusioned about work on a psychological level when they feel that their work isn't adding any value. That was one of Marx's core critiques about Capitalism when he argued how essential it was for the workers to control the means of production. The less valuable/necessary people percieve their jobs, regardless of how well compensated they are for it, the less satisfied they will be with their lives. I recently read an article about how the vast majority of people in cities like London, a place where many people (office drones) are employed in information industries doing jobs that didn't exist ten to fifteen years ago, feel that their jobs are utterly meaningless in the grand scheme of things (and they're not wrong) and many subsequently feel depressed.\n\n\nLondon is an extreme example but rest assured, with increasing automation, most other places will start to catch up. Information and information-based services will be (already is) the most important product that we produce, not physical goods/labour. This means is that the work we do as humans is becoming more work for the sake of work. A century ago, the majority of work that we did were things that quite obviously needed to be done. We repaired things, we built things, we provided crucial services, and so on. Think about ten people around you today and ask yourself: do the jobs they do create a net benefit for their lives and the lives of people around them, or are their jobs essentially bullshit?\n\n\nYou'd be surprised at how many jobs today add little to no value. Even if they do add some value, it's often not (nearly) enough to rationalize it taking up 40+ hours of someone's life each week. This trend is only going to get worse, too, as more and more \"critical\" jobs are automated/rendered obsolete and more and more bullshit jobs get added to the pool. It's no wonder that people are miserable: we've seen a kind of spiritual decay where the vast majority of people have become miserable in their employment and that it's only going to get worse until we decide enough is enough and no longer require people to work in order to provide for themselves. This is all exacerbated by the fact that we're collectively more educated and aware than we've ever been, and that we all know the most surefire way to become wealthy is to game the system (like on Wall Street), not create value for others.\n\n\nAs per the second point, say you disagree with my first point and want to argue that the value of new jobs being added to the economy is worthwhile enough to continue to employ the majority of people in new jobs. Fair enough. The other problem with this is that a lot of the jobs being added don't fit into the employment model of the past century. It's becoming harder and harder for companies to justify hiring people full time, putting them all in an office and making them sit in cubicles for 40+ hours per week. Just look at the business models of Uber, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram and so on: these companies are indicative of a 21st century employment model. They are not traditional vertically integrated companies that need to hire tens of thousands of people in order to function, instead they get by on hiring a handful of people and providing a service to more than a billion people. Traditional vertically integrated companies are learning from this as well and reducing the number of employees they have (when they can get away with it).\u00a0\n\n\nThanks to the internet and accelerating technological change, these 21st century business models are scalable in a way that traditional business models weren't. A lot of the information-based services and distribution models around them that needed to exist last century are totally irrelevant now and are in the middle of a mass extinction. That's why we've been hearing the death rattle from the MPAA and many other large \"information brokers\": they're irrelevant and they're flailing wildly trying to find a way to prop up the old business model just so they can survive (while making everyone hate them in the process). We don't need a middle man anymore, the software is the middle man with algorithms replacing humans as gatekeepers to 1s and 0s.\u00a0\n\n\nSo regardless of what you think about automation and job creation, you can't dodge the fact that our current employment models no longer make sense. The world is full of offices that exist for the sake of tradition (and supposed information security) where the majority of people sit at their desks doing valueless busy work and surfing the internet every chance they get. That's why we're seeing a huge boom in freelancing. A (regulated) Uber-style employment is likely going to be the new employment model for the next few decades. Companies are going to want to hire freelancers (from anywhere in the world), have them sign NDAs, produce X amount of work for them and those freelancers might do work for 2-3 companies at the same time.\n\n\nBlue collar work is no exception. Companies like McDonalds are slowly and carefully revealing to the world that they intend to phase out many of their workers in the coming years, something I expect will be accelerated by minimum wage increases. Retailers, large and small, are beginning to becoming nothing more than glorified show rooms and many are losing the battle against online shopping. Jobs in the transportation industry (taxis, trucking etc) see the writing on the wall. \"Sharing economy\" services like AirBnB and Uber will continue to have an impact. Services like Instagram and smartphone cameras killed vertically integrated behemoths like Kodak. The list goes on.\n\n\nAnyway, even if you think that automation is going to displace rather than replace people, I think you still need to concede that replacement is possible if we allow it, and that there are good arguments for replacement over creating jobs for the sake of creating jobs. First and foremost, unless we do something radical (like basic income) a lot of people (especially those not educated or business/tech savvy) are going to fall in the cracks opened up by accelerating change (like anyone who works in the transportation industry today). \n\nI also think there is another, even better argument for allowing ourselves to drop out of the labour market if we want to, and that argument is an environmental one: we overproduce and overconsume more than any other point in history, it is unsustainable and that we need to start producing and consuming less and therefore we need to start thinking up a new way to organize economic activity around the concept of sustainability.\n\n**Late edit**: added tl;dr\n\n**Tl;dr** \n\n- Basic human needs are finite and can be totally satisfied with automation in the foreseeable future\n- Current levels of automation have already displaced humans away from work that has obvious value\n- New jobs have increasingly less value than before when they are created in spaces where they can't be automated (yet) and thus job satisfaction is on the decline\n- Many new jobs are created for the sake of creating jobs (a symptom of past bureaucracies / legislation / remaining inertia from 20th century employment practices)\n- We increasingly overproduce and over consume because of our economic model and increased efficiency over time\n- The employment system is shifting from full time to part time freelancing type employment, which can be inhumane without the proper framework in place (basic income) \n- We need to change our antiquated view of work where we think every able bodied person should work to one where we see work as optional and less centralized \n- We need to think of a new economic system or else things will start getting ugly and this is true regardless of whether you think future automation will displace or replace humans"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Laws can define where natural rights are legally applicable. But laws can't give or take away inherent/natural rights. (Laws can, however, violate or protect those rights.)\n\nThere still must be a logical derivation of this right from nature if it exists.\n\nIf \"Natural law derives from the nature of man and the world, just as physical law derives from the nature of space, time, and matter.\" my question is, how exactly is it that you are proposing the right to firearms derives from nature?\n\n\"It just does\" is not a sufficient answer.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights\n\nExplain why we have the natural right to self defense, and how, logically, that right extends to include firearm ownership. Or the claim that gun rights derive from natural rights will remain entirely unsubstantiated.\n\nI actually think guns are the least of our problems, and I'm not really a \"gun-grabber\" because there are a couple dozen things I'd rather do first. (And if those happen, guns would mostly only be used for hunting, and target practice. And the potential for a strong national defence, like they ought to be.) I'd rather get people educated and out of poverty. Etc. I tell you this so you can understand, I'm an open mind on this issue, and if you can't convince me, you probably won't convince anyone.\n\nTo be clear: I could give a **** about gun rights, I don't see any logical derivation of those rights from nature. So far as I can see they are only legal rights and not natural rights at all.\n\nAt the same time, people who actually spend effort and time opposing gun rights annoy me, because (duh) there will always be weapons and violence until people get healthy and free. focusing actions on a wedge issue like guns serves to divide, and sow fear, rather than to unify and bring progress. Discussion, though, is another matter.\n\nI am currently against both \"gun grabbers\" (practically) and gun rights (ideologically). So I am mostly heavily neutral on this subject. I have serious questions about the central dogmas of both sides of this debate.\n\nTell me why I should no longer ideologically oppose gun rights. Show the logical derivation from nature, which I believe you are claiming exists. currently without an understanding of the justification for the claim that gun rights are natural rights, It is my view that many legal freedoms or impositions are a matter of practicality, justified by the basic and overriding human drive to form a safe, harmonious, and productive society, and then that guns are simply impractical toward this end.\n\nif you can't convince me of this, (or at least correctly formulate _any_ argument defending your position) , you are probably not really going to convince anyone.\n\nBut If your thought is that the right to firearms is derived from the right to self defend would it not make more sense that the natural right to self defend justifies the legal right to live in a firearm free environment. Since guns take more lives than they save?\n\nTo claim that a right is derived from nature without showing the logic of the derivation is equally meaningless as to claim that a right is granted by God.\n\nI see no logical derivation from nature for the right of humans to bear arms. (Bonus: I can't imagine that there is any which wouldn't also \"justify\" the \"rights of monkeys to bear arms\".)\n\nI invite you to Change My View.\nFirst Reply:\nI'll do my best with this.\n\n&gt;Explain why we have the natural right to self defense, and how, logically, that right extends to include firearm ownership. Or the claim that gun rights derive from natural rights will remain entirely unsubstantiated.\n\nIn the link you provided it's pretty clear that the right to live is a natural right. Well, if you are ever in a situation where your right to live is being threatened, how else are you going to defend that right? To me, logic dictates that the right to live and the right to self defense are mutually exclusive.\n\nNow, if you accept my statements above then we can move to why gun rights are a natural right. It's best to use examples of self defense situations. \n\nHere's an example of situation people have and could face. I'm hanging out in my house and someone (or a couple people) breaks in and they have a baseball bat(s) or some other deadly objects. If it is my right to live and therefore my right to self defense then I should have the best means of self defense available to me. Now, just to be clear, the best means in general isn't the best means in all situations, just that it's going to be better suited for a variety of situations. This is where a gun comes in to the picture. \n\nI'm in my house that now has a stranger(s) that's armed with a weapon(s), what am I supposed to do? There is the intention to harm me and I have to choose how best to defend myself. I could grab a bat, a golf club, a knife, etc., but what's the likelihood of one of those options actually being viable in this situation? I would be going toe to toe with someone who could be bigger, stronger and more prepared. What are my chances of survival and hopefully being unharmed in this situation? \n\nAnother option I could have is grabbing a gun, which is capable of dealing necessary force within a matter of seconds while potentially keeping some distance between me and that attacker. Now I have to ask the same question, what are my chances of survival and hopefully being unharmed in this situation? \n\n&gt;But If your thought is that the right to firearms is derived from the right to self defend would it not make more sense that the natural right to self defend justifies the legal right to live in a firearm free environment.\n\nHere's the problem, if you take away firearms then there is no longer an equalizer for a whole variety of situations, just like the example I have presented. There is the potential that you will be in a situation where you are having to defend yourself from someone else that has a gun, but at least it would be a lot closer to a \"fair\" fight. Having a gun doesn't require much strength, size, agility, etc., but with things like a bat, knife and hammer, those attributes absolutely play a role. \n\n&gt;Since guns take more lives than they save?\n\nThere's isn't any proof that this is a fact. Since the number of defensive gun uses is a very hard statistic to gather, it is unknown if guns save more live or cost more lives. One thing you have to consider is if you get rid of guns, that doesn't inherently mean that those lives wouldn't have been lost by other means. If you look at countries like England and Australia, the total number of murders and crime was unaffected by their gun control measures. If you actually look at the crime and murder rates in those countries, those statistics actually increased the first couple years after their gun bans. They did eventually start to decrease, but the US has also steadily decreased in the same periods. Sure there is less gun related crimes in those countries, but crimes were just committed by other means.\n\nI feel like I'm rambling on a bit at this point, so I'll leave it at this for now. If you feel like there is an important point of yours that I've messed, I can do my best to respond to that as well.\nSecond Reply:\nThe whole concept of \"natural rights\" is, as Jeremy Bentham described  it, \"nonsense on stilts.\" All of our legal rights are social constructs, no more and no less. The fact that they are social constructs does not make them any less meaningful or important. I don't really know why this reality is so discomforting to so many people. Perhaps it's because acknowledging this makes it clear that our rights *can* be taken away, and there is nothing \"above\" or \"beyond\" human society to safeguard them. But the facts are the facts, and while \"natural rights\" may be lofty rhetoric, the concept is ultimately a castle built made of sand. "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Since being poor isn't the poor person's fault (in most situations), I'd say being \"unattractive\" because you can't afford things that would make you \"attractive\" isn't your fault. You might say \"they should work harder, go to school, and get a better job,\" but I don't think their looks will be the first thing they spend their new salary on.\nSecond Reply:\nyou aren't 100% wrong, but the reasons you're wrong are significant, i think.\n\nfor now, i'm going to take it for granted that you meant people with average facial structures were entirely capable of making themselves more attractive at large. you seem to not quite take that seriously the idea of people with facial structures that are simply unattractive straight up and only talk about extreme cases, but i feel like taking this approach gets more to the spirit of your post.\n\nwhat i think is the key is to discuss the the fact that you said \"it's largely your fault\". not \"the causes are attributable to your lifestyle or choices\", or \"you played a significant role in it\", but \"fault\" implying that there's some blame involved, and there's some sort of responsibility to make yourself look more attractive. am i misinterpreting what you were getting at here? because \"it's your fault\" doesn't really feel like neutral phrasing. there definitely feels like some kind of lot of blaming going on here. \n\nyou don't seem to really take seriously however, the idea that a lot of these conditions, and whether or not someone acts on them, is not fully in the control of the person it applies to. you seem like the kind of person who'd say 'no matter your conditions, if you have a choice in the matter, and you don't take that choice, you are 100% responsible, and frankly, might be a pussy for not makign that choice', am i right?\n\nfor more clarification: do you think say, given any let's sat 3/10 person, and if you found the right clothes, exercise routines, hairstyles, maybe makeup routines and hygein practices, they could be generally attractive? do you think that would really hold up and that facial attractiveness that falls below average can really just be propped up by dressing up everything else?"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In the Senate he worked with Congressman Ron Paul to audit the Fed. He got a 10 billion dollar provision to increase the number of people community health centers served by 10 million. He worked with John McCain recently to craft the new Veterans Affairs Budget which was one of the most significant pieces of bipartisan legislation negotiated in a dysfunctional Congress.

Bernie is an independent, does not have serious alliances or close friends in Congress despite being there for over two decades. He has not gotten any notable legislation passed. Would he really negotiate the best possible international treaties for the US?\n\nAs a (I) senator, he doesn't have the \"party\" alliances a straightforward Dem or Rep would have because hes the *only* Ind in our federal legislative body. As Dem president, this would change as he'd have the entire Dem aisle. That, in conjunction with hes been in Senate and USHOR for 20+ years so he has friends and has worked on bills with other representatives. That, and as president, his negotiations would take on a whole new level of seriousness when dealing internationally. This is a sticky issue for any pres candidate as there's really no \"well ive done this so i can deal internationally\" for them to say (unless they're an former/incumbent POTUS). \n\n&gt;3) A President needs to be able to understand and navigate everyone's goals. Bernie doesn't seem to try to understand everyone's motivations but rather just gets angry at people who think differently from him. e.g. he says things like \"I'll never understand why some poor people vote republican\"\n\nHow is that any different then other reps? John Beohner swore to block anything and everything that Obama would try and pass. Strictly from a \"I dont like you\" POV. This is bullshit and he needs to be removed for this  (and other things). Were working on that (I live in Ohio). But regardless, to him, seeing the bush tax cuts and how the republicans love the system that is keeping poor people poor (Trickle Down, cutting social security/ social services, NAFTA/ various other trade deals) its a alright question. \n\n&gt;4) Being a leader involves standing up to or effectively dealing with bullies and thinking quickly. He has very little track record of doing this. And when the BLM protesters took his mic at his own rally, he just passively let it happen, seemed a bit bewildered. It may have been a reasonable decision to let them speak, but he clearly wasn't in control of the situation. How could he stand up to Putin, Khamenei, etc.? \n\nThis wasn't **his** event. It was a rally on Social Security, medicare that he was invited to speak at. If you watch the video, you'll see a guy (not Bernie) at the podium talking to the BLM girls. *That* guy was the organizer and Bernie said to him to let them speak. Its not about being a pushover, Its about, if i stop them, i look bad, i if i let them speak, ill look better and considering how he himself was arrested for nonviolent civil disobedience, it would be a little hypocritical for him to stop them. A 20 year old B.S. would probably sympathize with these girls and a 73 year old B.S. is still a civil rights sympathizer. \n\n\n**edit Spelling, grammar\n\nEdit#2 Here he is on \"State of the Union\" speaking about [ISIS](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/video-audio/sanders-on-cnns-state-of-the-union) \n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

So many people *identified* with the troubles of Holden Caulfield when they were younger and his reconciliation helped them reconcile something inside themselves, it did for me. Besides, fiction is a great way of expanding our knowledge of history, language, art, and much more. Reading To Kill a Mockingbird is to be taken back to another time and *live* the experience through the characters in the book. And some books serve an important social function - 1984 is hailed as a visionary work.\n\nI love reading fiction, and I know that I'm not alone.

The only factor at play when determining racism should be if someone is treating someone else worse because of their race or ethnicity.

If racism is simply as you define then there is no discussion, you would be right.  Here are some points I would need cleared up before I can comment:\n\n\"The only factor at play when determining racism should be if someone is treating someone\"- Can institutions and cultures be racist? Are they the \"someone\" in question? \n\"because of their race or ethnicity\"-How do you know when this criterion is met? Remember that behaviours are not necessarily reflective of the behaviour you're looking for. This seems to result in very few actual incidents of racism.\n\"race or ethnicity\"- Is race is even a coherent concept? If it isn't then can someone be a racist if they don't believe in race? \n\nThis is all connected to some central discussions in philosophy of race. There are many competing models of racism, each of which seems to be incomplete (at least to me), and there is a lack of general consensus. \nSecond Reply:\n&gt;The only factor at play when determining racism should be if someone is treating someone else worse because of their race or ethnicity.\n\nTreating someone *better* because of their race is just as racist.\n\nMore fundamentally one's treatment of others is secondary to the belief that causes that treatment. To be a racist all you need is to believe that individual behaviour and moral character is predetermined by your racial genetics.

Military industry keeps some of the very few manufacturing jobs in US, this industry's survival critically depends on US's defence policies and government orders, without US spending sizeable chunk of its budget on military, millions of jobs will be lost.\n\n2. US has the money. Yes, US is in some serious debt right now, however USD is the most indestructible currency ever existed in human history, with US's economy size, gold reserve and military power at its back, it is impossible for USD to collapse in the foreseeable future. US can always borrow more money from its own citizen or foreign countries without worrying about crisis like Greece happen. Further more, even if USD value drops as a consequence of US printing more cash to pay back debts, all other countries will follow to de-value their currencies to compete with US, just like we have seen in the past few years.\n\n3. US spending more on military doesn't necessary mean a safer world, but at least it will make its NATO allies safer. As a Canadian I know we don't have to worry about fighting off an invasion alone. US spending more on defence means we will spend less, this will benefit our economy and allow us to put more money into our welfare system.\n \n4. No matter how much US government sets its 'defence' budget,  US's armed force is built to be an offence force. Considering how the military complex works and US politician/public thinks, US will never stop bombing/invading smaller countries to defend its 'freedom'. Spending more money developing and ensuring US's technological advantage on military means less casualties from those inevitable wars.\n\n5. Military technologies benefits civilian life in the long run. We wouldn't get internet, GPS, jumble jets and spacecraft if US haven't thrown so much money into military. I want to see human land on Mars before I am 50, so come on US congress, make it happen!\n\n\nTo answer some of the most frequent questions:\n\n**Why not spend the money on infrastructure/medical research/education/NASA?**\n\nWell, when US was cutting military spending in the 90s, the federal spending on education/infrastructure/NASA/higher education research also went down. I fundamentally disagree the argument that 'we are not spending enough on such/such/such because we spend too much on military!' The fact is the amount we spend on military and other programs is not a zero sum game. Spending less on military dose not bring US better infrastructure/education/research. \n\n**US is already spending too much on military, it's by far the most powerful force in the world, why more?**\n\nIn % per GDP sense, US ranked No.21 in the world(3.5%), behind Saudi Arabia (10.8%), Israel (5.2%) and Russia (4.5%), this is not that much. Comparing to those countries and the collapsed USSR, US is in a much better financial state (see my point 2).\n\nAlso, US government and public have set their military force to be the keeper of freedom/world police ever since the end of WWII. Yes the current size of US military is too big for a defensive force. However, for what US public and government want it to be? I think the current spending is well justified if not insufficient. \nFirst Reply:\nSo I feel like this is a joke but I can't really tell. Here goes\n\nFirst, pretty much everything you're saying cal already be accomplished by maintaining our extremely high military funding. Here's a point by point response:\n\n1. Sure, but it also creates the military industrial complex. It  creates an incentive to go to war because it's profitable. Killing your own people and other people because you can make money is kinda a bad thing. The US can create jobs plenty of other ways: build infrastructure, invest in green energy, etc. and all of those are pretty harm-free\n\n2. Okay? But we already have a [noticeably stronger military](http://pgpf.org/Chart-Archive/0053_defense-comparison) than anyone else. Just because we *can* spend the money doesn't mean we *should* when it can be spent on [much better things](http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21605932-country-where-everyone-drives-america-has-shoddy-roads-bridging-gap)\n\n3. No, it means we go to war more. Which means we draw NATO allies into war. And we already have a military strong enough to protect our allies. Who in NATO is under any sort of threat right now?\n\n4. How about we just don't go to war in those cases? Increased spending at least makes it more likely that we go to useless wars\n\n5. So fund research, not military research.\nSecond Reply:\nYou have some arguments for why the US should spend more money in general, and other ones why spending on the military is better.  \n\n1. I think there better ways to support manufacturing jobs than just military spending.  Instead of building a 12th aircraft carrier, the US could spend that money manufacturing more buses or trains to improve US infrastructure.  This also could improve the economy and the quality of life of many Americans by making transportation better and easier.\n\n2. This is an argument for spending money in general, not necessarily on military spending.  The US is concerned about long term debt, and is actively cutting funding from plenty of other programs.  To some extent, there is a limit to what is spent total by the government, and so more military spending inevitably will mean less spending on other programs.  \n\n3. Most Americans will not be terribly motivated to think that their additional military spending will lead to Canadians having richer social programs, especially if it comes with cuts to American social programs.  Additionally, the US military is already overwhelming strong, and more or less spending probably wouldn't impact strength in any meaningful way.  The US spends approximately as much on its military as the rest of the world.  Most of the other top spending countries are allies of the US.  \n4. There are ways to continue high R&amp;D budgets in the military without spending as much.  About $300 billion/~$700 billion of the annually spent military budget is on pay and benefits for soldiers. That means that the US Militiary will spend more in wages and benefits in 2015 than the Canadian government will spend **in total** in 2015.  One of the big reasons for this is that the US military has hundred of thousands of soldiers stationed overseas, including about 60,000 in Germany and 30,000 in Japan, where troops have been stationed since the end of WWII.  \n5. The military isn't the only program the US can spend money on.  They can support NASA, scientific grants, etc, many of which would provide a much better bang for the buck in terms of scientific achievement.  "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

To be clear, I am no fan of Huckabee, and I have nothing against our military or militaries in general. That said, I think he was dead on.\n\nI think most people who don't accept this do so because they think it's crass, and brutal. Well, yeah, but it's also absolutely true. That's why the military has all those rifles and artillery and tanks and battleships and bombs and chemical weapons and knives and humvees and machine guns: for the killing of people and the breaking of things. Sure, not every member of the military's job is to be a killer, but those people are there to support the killers. The cooks, mechanics, engineers, and secretaries are all there to let everyone else kill people and break things as safely and efficiently as possible.\n\nAgain, I have absolutely no problem with this from a moral perspective. I am certainly not condemning anybody, just stating facts. Most people I've seen disagree with Huckabee are just dancing around this. \"Soldiers exist to protect the United States and her interests!\" Sure, using violence or the threat of violence. \"The army doesn't just kill people, they developed the Internet!\" Yeah, as a weapon to coordinate their violence in the most efficient way possible. The internet we have now is just an unintended side effect.\n\nThe US military is in a bit of a unique position, since they haven't had a lot of opportunities to do their job recently. Our military is so badass, there are not a lot of people with enough courage or stupidity to take us on. Thus, a lot of time is spent running practice drills and handing out food to people after earthquakes. That's great, but it's all a displacement activity until they need to do their real job. It's a sideshow, a distraction. The alternative would be these men sitting around, waiting for something to need destroying. We don't keep our military around and spend billions of dollars for disaster relief. We keep them around to kill people and break things. That's their real purpose, simple as that.\n\nFirst Reply:\nThe purpose of the military is to accomplish the missions given to it. If that mission isn't best served by killing people and breaking things, then that isn't what they're going to do.\n\nFor instance, the Navy has hospital ships. Sometimes they're sent out for relief efforts. The goal of the mission there is decidedly *not* to break things or kill people.\nSecond Reply:\nThis is like saying that the purpose of a surgeon is to cut people open. It's a description of a large part of what a surgeon does, but that's not the same as purpose. The surgeon can't say that their purpose is achieved just by virtue of taking a scalpel to the patient.\n\nSame goes for the military. Killing people and breaking things is a means to an end, not an end in its own right. The military can't say \"We killed people and broke things. Mission accomplished.\" if the desired political objective hasn't been met. Are you sure that purpose is the thing you're trying to argue here?"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Before you ask us why you don't think another republican can win, you should really take a look at yourself first. You've likely surrounded yourself in an echo chamber.\n\nI present 2 reasons why the Republicans are still going strong:\n\n1) Young people don't vote. The showing for elections is pitiful, but especially among young people. And demographics show that the older you get, the more likely you are to vote. This is even more evident when the elections get smaller - when was the last time you voted for city commissioner? Probably never. But your grandma has in the past 5 elections.\n\n2) Some people don't care about those things, and care about other things instead. The most obvious example is economics. Conservatives favor policies which are more favorable to business and economic growth than liberals. They support lower taxes, less regulation, and fewer worker's rights. If you are involved in running a business, or realize that you might lose your job (even your shitty, underpaid job) if your business loses its competitive edge, you will care far more about keeping the economy going strong than whether or not two men can get married in Nevada. \nSecond Reply:\nI'm a young, college educated, conservative in a democrat heavy state. The flaw in your position that I see is [issue salience](http://sppc2014.indiana.edu/Papers/Bromley-Trujillo%20et%20al.pdf). People care about certain issues more than others and give greater weight to those when comparing candidates. If social issues don't feature prominently in an election, i.e., we talked about the economy, foreign policy, energy policy, etc., voters are likely to make their decision on other issues and choose a candidate who they disagreed with on social issues. The state of the economy is of far greater concern to most voters than marijuana legalization for example. Abortion tends to be the biggest exception to this, since most people tend to have strong views on the subject and for many voters it is a must-agree issue.  \n\nRepublicans can in my view definitely win another election. A 2% swing nationally would have won Romney the election. If the any of the elements of the Obama coalition don't show up in the future, than the necessary swing is even smaller.

But I think that if we were to put a place a law mandating employers to give paid maternity leave, it would result in unfair hiring biases against women. Some employers would develop a preference for hiring men over women because, if you are purely concerned with profit as lots of employers are, why take the risk of hiring a lady who might take a lot of time from work while you can just not risk it and hire a man? There are already a lot of stereotypes about women being less dedicated to their jobs than men because they are \"more focused on kids\". Wouldn't a mandatory maternity leave just make this worse? \n\nIt's particularly unfair to women who aren't planning on having kids because employers could be biased against them for expecting them to use something they won't ever even need in the first place!\n\nIf paternity leave were also mandated, then this would be less of a problem because men would be as likely (or nearly as likely) to take leave as well, making the \"expected value\" of a man's labor to an employer the same as a woman's, and hopefully eliminating the bias.\n\n\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nWhile perhaps in a world where everyone made decisions based on pure rational thinking, this might be true, I don't think this would be an issue in the real world, for two main reasons (both of which are based in current popular perceptions):\n\n1.  As /u/Madplato mentioned, employers are often already biased against hiring women because of the perception that they will probably get pregnant at some point and take off from work.  I don't think requiring employers to pay for the maternity leave would much affect this perception, because I doubt employers will seriously think women who otherwise wouldn't have gotten pregnant and taken time off anyway will now decide to do so just for a few months' pay.  This negative perception of women already unfairly affects women who don't intend to have children.\n\n2.  Employers often already have a perception that men will be more dedicated workers, whether or not you have paid maternity leave, or paid leave for both parents; there's an expectation that men will take less time off for any family-related reason than women.  So I think even if a law requiring paid maternity leave did harm women, adding paid paternity leave wouldn't fix that, because the underlying assumptions about men and women wouldn't change.\n\nFinally, I would say that even taking into account a small chance that employers will discriminate against women more if required to pay for maternity leave, it would still do more good than harm to women workers on the whole.  Not being able to take any time off work to recover from pregnancy and spend quality time with your baby can be a huge source of pressure for women, and can force women to put off having children until later than they would want.  All of these factors harm women.\nSecond Reply:\nFirstly, I think what you're describing is already happening, simply because women do get pregnant and, mandatory leave or not, will take time off work at some point because of it. There's not much way around it. In the event where the government pays most of the salary while on leave, I don't think hiring practice would change much. \n\nSecondly, I agree that paid paternity leave should also be an option in the event of a mandatory paid maternity leave, if only for the sake of equality. However, I don't think this will change the current hiring practices, simply because I believe males will be less likely to take these leaves than women. \n\n\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Adults have more money than kids and can afford the higher prices. Kids pricing allows family's to be able to afford to go to things as a family. For certain things, size does matter (fuel costs for transportation) and most adults are bigger than most kids and so should get charged more. And specific to theaters, adults are more likely to see an R rated and since the R-ratings are somewhat prohibitive in terms of selling tickets, I could see some sort of roundabout justification for increasing tickets prices for adults as they are likely to see a movie that falls into this mildly \"niche\" category of movies. \n\nI think the problem I have is that most (if not all movie theaters) consider you and adult at thirteen or fourteen. This doesn't make any sense. A thirteen year old doesn't have much more money does a twelve year old. They don't even have the right to work for another few years. They're not much bigger than a twelve year old and even if they were it wouldn't really matter because its not like bigger movie goes are more costly than a small movie goer. They can't see rated R movies. It seems like the only \"right\" they've acquired is to technically see a PG-13 movie but they probably could do that before age thirteen and it hardly seems to justify a price increase. I know that thirteen is not universal but I find it wrong to charge adult prices for anyone under eighteen (you could maybe argue seventeen since they can see rated R movies and can work).\n\nPlease leave the footnote below the following line, but remember to delete this sentence by replacing it with the body of your post. Thank you!\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nThere are three justifications for the price differences for children under 13. \n\nFirst, teenagers and young adults attend the movies more often than any other demographic. That group is over represented - People from 12-18 represent only 8% of the population but represent 16% of the movie going audience and 18 to 24 year olds represent 19% of the audience but just 10% of the population.  However, children under 12 are underrepresented - they make up just 7% of the typical movie going audience while being 14% of the population. (By the way, these stats are from 2010 since I couldn't find anything more recent).  The only other group that is significantly underrepresented are seniors. \nSo the theater industry offers discounts to those underrepresented groups needs to incentivize them to attend. Thus, we regularly see discounts for senior &amp; children 12 and under at movie theaters.   However, since teenagers are showing up in numbers already, it doesn't make sense to target them with a discount. You want them paying full price.  \n\nSecond , as was mentioned above, is that a lower child price targets families. It's essentially making attending the movies as a family less expensive and thus more attractive option.  Other groups - a pack of teenagers for example - are less likely to consider the total cost for the group since they will be paying for their tickets individually. However,  families are going to be very aware of the total cost since they will not be paying individually.  And, they will be comparing that total cost against other entertainment options. So a teenager might be asking \"is it worth $15 bucks to see this movie with my friends\" while a family of four  is asking \"is $60 worth it to see this movie.\"  Once you start considering that total cost, it may not sound like much of s value. So, theaters improving that value proposition with a discount makes sense. \n\nFinally, I'd argue that in general the younger a person is, the less they get out of a movie. Now, that's not true for all movies. But, if a parent is considering attending let's say a typical drama, I think you would conclude that your 11 year old might not appreciate or understand that movie well enough to justify the $15 a full priced ticket will cost.  That is not to say the child won't get any enjoyment out of that movie, but a lower price might convince a parent to bring a child that they wouldn't for full price. Also, and I think more importantly, that parent might not attend that movie unless they can take their child (think single or stay at home parents, or just those unwilling to attend the movies without their children).  Now, like a said, I don't think this is true for every movie, but for certain movies a discounted child ticket price can be justified by young children being less able to appreciate those movies. \n\n\n \nSecond Reply:\nIt's about attracting customers. If a parent is going to take their kids somewhere, cost will certainly be a factor. If they have to pay full price for multiple tickets than it might make them choose somewhere else to go. By giving a discount for young kids they attract more business from parents. 13 or so is about the age kids start going to movies with friends instead of their parents. Sure they are still borrowing money from their parents, but now the few extra dollars for a ticket isn't as big of a deal since they are only paying for one ticket instead of 2 or 3 or however many kids they might have.

While fear of extermination would indeed be justified in 1930s Europe, fear of extermination by Islamic terrorists continues today even in Canada and the US. I've even heard that ISIS is going to exterminate the Jews, even though ISIS has not killed a single Jewish person to this date.\n\nThere is a widely-held view in Jewish circles that the UN is inherently anti-Semitic even though the majority of permanent members of the UN Security Council are very pro-Israel. UN troops never interfere with Israeli military operations and one of the first UN resolutions was the establishment of the State of Israel. Still, extremist groups like the JDL (Jewish Defence League) attract support from mainstream Jewish organizations, despite their classification as a terrorist group.\n\nThe Jewish community seems to think that their politicians at home persecute them as well. I know so many liberal Jews who will vote for a right-wing party just because they scream their unwavering support for Israel the loudest. Currently, every single major candidate running for President of the United States or Prime Minister of Canada has declared their staunch support for Israel; even left-wingers like Bernie Sanders and Canada's frontrunner Tom Mulcair.\n\nMeanwhile, white cops are killing black kids at a horrifying rate but the Jewish community is still focused on their own supposed persecution. When the Charleston shooting broke out, my synagogue had one moment of silence then continued with its Israel fundraiser. My theory is that North American Jewish culture has developed an irrational persecution complex due to past persecution ritualistically retold every Hanukkah, Passover, Purim, Yom Ha'Shoah, etc. I realize this may come off as anti-Semetic and indeed my own family has called me a \"self-hating Jew\", although I think this only reinforces my point. Will someone change my view?\nFirst Reply:\nYou've developed a theory based on your own family and community, and anecdotes from some national figures and events. But the question is, does the theory represent the majority of North American Jews.\n\nIn my experience it does not, and I also see plenty of national figures that support my position, such as for example [Chomky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky#Political_views), Jon Stewart, [Schulman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Schulman#Activism), etc.; Jews are very active in the BDS movement; and there is of course [J Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_Street) and so forth.\n\nWhy is your experience different from mine? Well, you mentioned \"my synagogue.\" It is very possible that your theory is right about more religious Jews, but a lot of Jews in the US are non-religious and never or almost never go to a synagogue. They are also much less supportive of Israel and far less likely to think Jews are persecuted.\n\nYou might be right that the Jewish **religion** focuses a lot on persecution of Jews (which makes sense, it's how Jews survived), but it simply is [not a big factor in the lives of many or most Jews in North America today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jews#Observances_and_engagement): Even of Jews that consider themselves \"strongly connected\" to the Jewish religion, less than half belong to a synagogue. And more and more Jews just don't care about religion, considering themselves only \"culturally Jewish\", 20% in 1990 to 37% in 2008, and by now that number is even higher.\n\nSecond Reply:\nYou have to remember that many Jews alive today were actively persecuted and discriminated against in North America. By chance I just just finished reading an article about Jon Stewart where he describes being bullied for his religion as a child. Clubs still excluded Jewish members and Jews were still treated as very much separate from the rest of society. People who grew up in the 50s, 60s and 70s still faced a fair amount of discrimination as children and younger adults and it's not unreasonable to be affected by that. That makes feelings of persecution entirely rational."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Not only is dota 2 completely free to play, the actual gameplay is better, and the graphics are much better.\n\n\n-The Dota 2 map is larger and has more interesting features for vision and juking.\n\n\n-Dota 2 has TP scrolls and a courier allowing for more interesting map movement.\n\n\n-Dota 2 heroes have much more unique and scaled up abillities than LoL Champions.  Think techies vs teemo, and heroes like tinker, meepo, lone druid, invoker, etc.  LoL heroes typically have a couple skillshot nukes and a movement abillity as a rule of thumb.\n\n\n-Denying, highground miss chance, and pulling/stacking make laning much more interesting in Dota.\n\n\n-Ancients and Roshan are much more interesting high value targets than Dragon or Baron.\n\n\n-Towers are much weaker in Dota, and smoke of deceit exists, allowing for much more aggressive gameplay.\n\n\n-Dota heros are much more turbocharged, any dota hero ported exactly would be the strongest champion in League of Legends.\n\n\n-Activatable items improve gameplay decisionmaking.  LoL items are boring and mostly just stat based.  Dota items allow for much more customizablility in item build and improvement in game play (blink dagger 18 second cooldown vs. flash 300 second cooldown).\n\n\nDota 2 has a higher barrier of entry in a style of game whose focus is improvement, and that might lead people to LoL, but given the massive time investment in either game this is basically irrelevent.\n\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nAh ha!\n\nThe superior game offers more meaningful options to a player at all periods of the game. A false option, a calculation or a forgone outcome are not fun.\n\nDotA2 is a strategic game. Everything you do has weight, but you do not get to do much. For example, hero choice is a big choice, but once made, you do not get to do anything about lane matchup, thats a forgone conclusion of the matchup. Your powercurve has been decided. Fights have long CC, and many targeted abilities: You will get hit with stuff, and the timing of these big things is strategic, but really, there is no choices.\n\nLoL is tactical. Most things you do have little weight but there are many options. Almost any hero is playable into any other hero. Builds allow many different options and power curves. Fights are fluid and skillful with skillshots to dodge and many decisions as to targets and timing of spell use.\n\nI can take your points one by one and show you how this works:\n\n1. The map is larger with less vision to make your choice where to go a more impactful one, but the longer distance means you cannot make destination choices often or you will lose time. LoL's smaller map means your position is more tactical, and allows people to redeploy faster.\n\n2. Courier attacks are highly strategic, but leave players with no choices. LoL's recalls give lots of choices, and while most of them only lead to a small gold advantage gained, good players can abuse recall timing to get significantly more farm.\n\n3. You have bigger skills and more unique heroes, which means choice is strategic, but it also means that what you do in fights has been predetermined and you only have a calculation of who to click on to do. Champions with more closely related skill push both players to try attain their perfect play, while denying the opponent something similar, many more tactical choices.\n\n4. The laning mechanics are literally tacked on because without them it would be dull. Heroes have strategic spell casts with massive mana costs, meaning you can make big decisions very infreqently. Thus, to fill time and stop bored players, denying and miss had to be added. LoL lets you cast often, and while each cast is less impactful, it leads to many tactical choices in lane, with spell harass and use being the main point.\n\n5. Roshan is definately a boring objective, granting nothing more than gold and a extra life. Anchient camps are even worse, they only give gold. Dragon gives a stacking buff which forces people to consider the value of each dragon in the context of the unlocked lategame buff. Baron gives a buff which basically makes it impossible to defend against sieges by empowering minions, much more interesting.\n\n6. While DotA heroes are very strong, they are very perscriptive in how they have to be played, offering few choices to the player and even fewer in a matchup. By having more similar champions, interactions are more even and offer many more choices.\n\n7. Active items are simply one extra calculation: \"When is it best for me to use this\" with there being a single best time. Cooldowns are not long enough to make this a unclear decision, and so, in both games, they simply form another button to press.\n\nDotA2 is a harder game, because you must have massive strategic knowledge to play it at any level. You must know matchups, power curves etc etc due to the few choices you can make having high impact. LoL is a easier to start game, as you have many choices to make, which do not have individual large impact. The tactical nature limits the required information starting out, allowing people to  grasp it easily.\n\nDotA2 is not a bad game, rather it is simply a complex game with many mechanics which require a deep knowledge and for this reason it can be said to limit the choices a player can make and this is something a lot of people dislike, leading to the playerbase discrepancy.\n\nLoL is simply superior, more people play it, and the game actively encourages making meaningful choices, the crucial fun in a game.\nSecond Reply:\nAs someone with 3k+ games of League under his belt and three years of DotA Allstars experience, I think you can pretty easily narrow down your argument to \"complex games are better\". \n\nBut that's not true in all situations, and my current circle of gaming friends is a perfect example. Not one out or the ten of them us willing to even touch DotA because of its complexity, primarily because they're really not good at video games. \n\nFor people who enjoy difficult games with high skill ceilings, DotA is certainly superior - but your claim is missing that bit of context, because not everyone enjoys difficult games, and not everyone aspires to have a high skill level. \n\nThat last part in particular is a point I'm personally trying to come to grips with, but it's apparently the primary mode my friends have - they just want to play to have fun, not to get good; and at all opportunities they will choose having fun over being good. Thus, league is perfect for them - nanda DotA is nothing short of cancer. \n\n\nAnd yes, I die a little every day due to being surrounded by casuals. "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The issue seems really complex to me, but at the moment that is what I think. Currently, the migrant crisis is one of the biggest items of concern for Europeans. Most Europeans say, with much accuracy, that the migrant stream has to be shut off because a) immigrants are a weight on the economy, and b) most migrants refuse to assimilate, creating a lot of social problems. However, I still feel like they have to own up to that problem. Western societies historically engaged in colonialism and imperialism and profited over it so much, that they achieved wealth that continues to earn their country the status of \"developed/first-world.\" Often times when they did this, they ended up creating conditions in the colonized country that would be unfavorable to their future development. I know most Europeans/Americans would respond to this by saying \"I had nothing to do with this, why should I take responsibility over the past?\" but I find that to be a really weak argument. If my grandfather robbed somebody of something, died, and passed the stolen goods/money down to me, don't I have a moral obligation to return the stolen items, even if I had nothing to do with the crime? I think I would. Maybe the main problem with my view is that it is purely moral, and not legal/practical. But letting poor people work out the problems that are partly as a result of your people's past seems very selfish to me. \n\n\nFirst Reply:\nI think ascribing responsibility based on past wrongs is begging the question. If you see someone drowning right in front of you, you have a moral obligation to try and save them even if you didn't push them into the water. \n\nWhatever our direct ancestors did or didn't do, each individual is born who they are by pure luck. Your consciousness didn't \"earn\" a first-world upbringing in the beforelife, you were just dealt better cards. If you let people starve and be oppressed and killed just because they were born somewhere else, you're saying that were the lottery of birth redrawn and the winners reversed, you'd deserve no help either, and should accept your miserable fate.\n\nUnless human rights are afforded to all humans, they are neither universal nor unalienable, a pretty lie that can be snatched away from you just as easily as someone else when it becomes convenient for the powerful.\nSecond Reply:\nI don't think most people have *that* much of a problem with the \"my grandpa stole your grandpa's axe, I still have it in my garage, so morally I should give it back\" unless it goes back so far that there's really no legitimate way to determine who it goes to, etc., etc.\n\nHowever, that's not really what's going on here. As typically presented, a better analogy would be \"My great-great-grandfather raped your great-great-grandmother, so I should pay child support to you\" or \"My grandfather beat up your grandfather and kept him from starting his own business, so I owe you a restaurant\".\n\nOr even more often, \"some people completely unrelated to me or my ancestors, who happen to have also lived in the same country I live in now screwed up your country, so now I'm obligated to help fix it\". That seems like a pretty morally questionable stance to me. \n\nMany people in the U.S. today didn't even *have* ancestors in the U.S. when slavery happened, should they have to pay taxes to pay reparations because we once had slaveowners?"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The theory isn't backed by much scientific evidence as far as i know, so the reason to believe in an afterlife isn't that it makes more sense but that it makes life easier. A fear of death and impermanence so strong that one must believe in something that i would categorize as fairytale. This is what i would call a weakness. \n\nThe need for moral guidance in life - to need guidance from religion to know the difference between right and wrong is also a sign of weakness in that it shows a lack of judgement and wisdom for one to decide for themselves what is right or wrong. Furthermore, the need of a consequence by eternal damnation as persuasion not to do \"bad things\", and the need of an incentive by eternal salvation to do good. Is a sign of weakness in that it shows that human-nature is bad, or barbaric in a sense.\n\n\n\n\nFirst Reply:\n&gt;The theory isn't backed by much scientific evidence as far as i know, so the reason to believe in an afterlife isn't that it makes more sense but that it makes life easier. A fear of death and impermanence so strong that one must believe in something that i would categorize as fairytale. This is what i would call a weakness. \n\nSo things that make life easier make you weaker?\n\nThat's incorrect. Humans have a limited attention span. Making things easier allows you to better focus on important tasks.\n\n&gt;The need for moral guidance in life - to need guidance from religion to know the difference between right and wrong is also a sign of weakness in that it shows a lack of judgement and wisdom for one to decide for themselves what is right or wrong.\n\nSo you're saying that learning how to behave from elders leads to you being weaker?\n\nThat's also incorrect, humans are much more effective with teaching and aid from adults.\n\n&gt;Furthermore, the need of a consequence by eternal damnation as persuasion not to do \"bad things\", and the need of an incentive by eternal salvation to do good. Is a sign of weakness in that it shows that human-nature is bad, or barbaric in a sense.\n\nSo here you're saying artificially produced reward and punishment schemes are unhelpful and demonstrate barbaric behaviour?\n\nAlso incorrect, humans are rational intelligent beings and it's fairly normal for them to create artificial incentive structures to aid proper behaviour, like golden stars for doing well at class, or setting artificial goals like having a bookshelf of a favorite author.\n\nNone of your stated weaknesses are actual weaknesses. There are religious groups with genuine weaknesses like jehovah's witnesses who refuse to take blood transplants, or the Hindu practice of followers of the Vishnu Smriti burning widows, but vague non weaknesses don't mean much. If a weakness leads to physical harm then it's a bit more serious, but vague emotional ones mean little.\n\nThere are many practices of religious people that humans in general do. Religious people speak. This isn't a sign of their weakness at nonverbal communication. Religious people exercise. This isn't a sign they are wasting calories. Religious people read. This isn't a sign of their lack of sociability. These are all common human traits that aren't weaknesses.\nSecond Reply:\n&gt;The need for an afterlife\n\n&gt;The need for moral guidance in life\n\nDoesn't the fact that not all humans 'need' these indicate that it isn't a 'human weakness' (if it is indeed a weakness)? Also, aren't coping mechanisms generally considered a strength, rather than a weakness? With the afterlife, for instance, the fear of death might be a sign of human weakness, but the ability to surmount that fear is a sign of strength and resourcefulness, isn't it?"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I quite enjoy listening to anecdotal evidence to get new perspectives I wouldn't have thought of or haven't heard before.\n\nI understand that in an anecdotal case it is not scientific because it cannot be replicated and held to control standards, but I don't think this is grounds for dismissing the case as merely anecdotal and not worth mentioning.

Now then, with say two or three dots, can you tell that the picture will be a car? Of course not. The person supplying that data point could have just been extremely unlucky or extremely lucky. However, when you have say 500 dots, then you can clearly see that the picture will be a Ferrari.  This collection of anecdotes collectively is empirical data. you can perform statistical analysis on it to find am average trend. Rather than seeing just a point, you now have a view of the entire bell curve. If someone was unusually unlucky, you will be able to tell and know that in reality, it's a solid product. Likewise, if someone has been unusually lucky, you can also tell and know that you will most likely get a bad product.\n\n\nSecond Reply:\nYou aren't totally wrong about it.

In fact, I think they are so often ignored that I start to doubt my own view, hence this post. I'm a little embarrassed to share it. Here's my basic line of thought:\n\n* Stereotypes exist because the generalization is accurate.\n* Several of society's popular problems are blamed on other people acting with an awareness of stereotypes, or the stereotypes themselves.\n* A lot of cases regarding these problems are caused or made worse by the victim acting in accordance with a stereotype while blaming either the stereotype or something else.\n* If people made more of a conscious effort to not act in accordance with a stereotype in a situation where the stereotype could be considered relevant less incidents would occur.\n* When less incidents occur the stereotype changes or evaporates completely. \n\n'Victim' is somewhat of a loose term here (I'm excluding people who are indirectly involved with an incident pertaining to whatever social ill anyone might refer to) so before you shout \"victim blaming!\" I'll freely state that yes, I believe victims are *very rarely* 100% free from some kind of responsibility. \n\nAn example would be a black man being pulled over in a bad neighborhood and getting ticketed, arrested, or worse after arguing with/ resisting the police officer. We *might* be able to argue the man was unfairly profiled, but we can't prove something like that. It's much easier to take preventative measures (respect and compliance with the officer, no matter how shitty of a person they may be) and either avoid the situation completely or not make it harder than it needs to be. But once the black driver starts getting loud and upset, in the cops mind he's just another loud black person (fulfilling the stereotype) which could lead the officer to believe that the driver fulfills other aspects of his stereotype. \n\nAnother quick example would be the stereotype of men only being interested in sex and men saying \"not all men are pigs.\" Well, if that stereotype upsets you as a man, the only thing you can really do that will have any kind of effect is to not be a pig! But nobody seems to realize this, they just want everyone else to do what they ask. \n\nObviously I'm not proposing an over-night fix to any social issue, but what I'm proposing would benefit our society a lot more than victims telling everyone else to stop stereotyping. Pointing the finger at the aggressor(s) doesn't actually help solve the whole problem; all that does is either end that individual incident or piss people off. That shortsightedness does absolutely nothing to solve the problem on any kind of large, lasting scale. \n\nI'm happy to edit for any needed clarification. \nCMV!\n\nFirst Reply:\n&gt; Stereotypes exist because the generalization is accurate.\n\nThe problem is that its not strictly accurate on a individual level.  \"I am already a highly intelligent black person, what should I change so people stop stereotyping me as stupid?\"\n\nThere is also many times where you cannot avoid the impact of negative stereotypes even if you change becuase you aren't given the chance. \nSecond Reply:\n&gt;Stereotypes exist because the generalization is accurate.\n\nProve it. This is a sheer question of fact: If \"the generalization is accurate\" in every case of harmful stereotype, then it shouldn't be hard to prove. If not, then you have to admit (if you're not being intellectually dishonest and are arguing in good faith) that you're succumbing to [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) and thus are flawed logically in this.\n\nI don't have a ready source for this, but I remember it from a college class about critical thinking: on average, it takes 5 times of people defying stereotypes to counteract 1 person reinforcing that stereotype. \n\nSo, are you sure that you're *really* not just seeing 20% of the population and applying it to the other 80%?"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It's known that children who are spanked and harshly disciplined are more likely to show signs of anxiety and depressive symptoms.

You should certainly read [this article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/moral-landscapes/201309/research-spanking-it-s-bad-all-kids) from Psychology Today that talks about the issue in detail.

Talking about (or legislating) 'Rights' without mentioning 'responsibilities and 'limits' encourages faulty, destructive thinking.\nPeople talk about 'natural' or 'God-given rights', but all rights can be taken from you. If rights like \"free speech\" or \"free association\" are 'inalienable', 'natural', or 'God-given', how come so many people don't have them. \"Rights\" are created by the state, on their terms.\n\nI hear alot of people claiming \"The right to free speech\", or \"The right to the pursuit of happiness\". Looking at the world in these terms is false, misleading and detrimental to society. No rights are absolute- the world would be screwed if they were. Laws about inciting violence, truth in advertising, libel, slander, pornography, threats, extortion, racial vilification, sexual harassment, tax fraud and many, many more, all limit free speech, but are vital for society. \nCan I \"pursue happiness\" by running over the elderly in my F150, or selling crack to toddlers? But I got the \"right\"!! right? All 'rights' have limits. Looking at things purely in terms of \"rights\"\ncreates a selfish, narcissistic, entitled, unreasonable mindset.\n\nRights and responsibilities are two sides of the same coin, but there's no \"Bill of Responsibilities\". Talking about 'Rights' like this\nmakes people think they can do what they want, coz \"I got Rights!!\". \n\nRights are a myth, and we need a better model for thinking about personal freedom.\nFirst Reply:\nI'm not here to completely change your mind. On the responsibilities note:\n\nMy understanding of rights-based political philosophy is that rights are the bare minimum of what peoples generally agree on as the bare minimum of requirements for people to be able to pursue something like freedom or a good life. Rights aren't enabling you to do anything - they are restricting the government from interfering in your life. (The most cited example of this misunderstanding in the US is people who say ridiculous things and then cite the first amendment of the US constitution- the first amendment limits government censorship - not fellow citizens.)\n\nThe responsibilities bit is not brought up because (1) it is presupposed that most people won't step-up and (2) taking responsibility in open society has its own rewards. So on the first note, guess what there were drunks/deadbeats/dropouts in every day and age - and so you know that some people aren't even capable of a full public life (ie voting, volunteering, getting involved in the community, stepping up at work, etc, etc). Also, to be fair, a lot political philosophy was only about property-owning men - their very lives were based on their supremacy over everyone else. So for instance, you couldn't argue that non-property owning men and women would have public responsibilities because it would undermine the mental model of inferior women and non-property owners.\n\nPoint two, where responsibility is its own reward:\nThe other aspect of it is that it was assumed that if you became part of public society you got to do all these other fun things: dances, you could network for your job or future wife, meet interesting people, potentially take political office, siphon public funds etc etc.\n\nThe rights model is based on a morally-normative model and is therefore problematic. But this was known quite a long time ago: even Spinoza's (mid-1600's) political philosophy, more or less, replaces rights with abilities and interest.\n\nBut all philosophy aside- what is of dire interest to me is why Americans seem to be (1) uninterested in history and or (2) unwilling to hold our government to the basic principles of both our constitution and our founding.\n\nIt's very interesting to me that people rationalize government misdeeds and overreaches - or make ironic jokes about them. (\"I'm sure I'm on a list somewhere.\") Or they may simply shrug and say: \"They are only catching the bad guys.\" As if that isn't how every horrifying misdeed starts or somehow makes it better that they lied to American congress.\n\nTL;DR: You are right, rights aren't alright. Your terminology is slightly off.\nSecond Reply:\nFormer civics teacher here. Regarding your statement that \n\n&gt; Rights and responsibilities are two sides of the same coin, but there's no \"Bill of Responsibilities\"\n\nand the implication that we need to refer more to responsibilities of citizenship, I agree 100%. There is a sense of entitlement among American citizens today; I can't say if it's existed in other epochs, but it does seem to have a deleterious effect on our political discourse, and on civil society more generally.\n\nThat said, the notion that\n\n&gt; Rights are a myth\n\nand\n\n&gt; 'Rights' are not a real thing. They exist only as much as the state allows\n\nis a dangerous one. The notion of limited government, i.e. a government created of, by, and for the people, which can only create new laws within the framework of a constitution, exists to protect citizens from the excesses of unchecked government power. The companion notion of natural rights is necessary for the conception of limited government. If, as you claim, rights come *from the government*, what stops government from switching things up and determining that, for example, we don't have a right to due process? (Some would argue that this is already happening, but I'll get to that in a moment.) That we don't have a right to the proceeds of our labor? What if the President decided that he needed a new palace, that term limits--hell, even those pesky elections--aren't really necessary, and so he upped the tax rate to near 100% and declared himself emperor? Historically, all a ruler needs is the support of the elites and the military to make that happen. A generally-accepted belief in limited government and natural rights doesn't inherently prevent these abuses, but it's a very good first step. (It's especially a good step because the members of the military, who generally aren't the elites, will have been conditioned to believe in limited government just as they have been conditioned to follow strict lines of authority, so they're less likely to quietly sign on to a power grab by a rogue President.)\n\nAs to your point below that \n\n&gt; 'rights' aren't about compromise; they're about entitlement\n\nthis is patently false. Rights will necessarily conflict. There are very few moral systems that argue that there are not overlaps in rights, where priority must be given to some over others. (Modern American libertarians would make the argument that the Non-Aggression Principle is a single rule to determine all disputes, but this is problematic in its own right; for example, it allows for the extreme interpretation that my current self cannot 'enslave' my future self by signing contracts, making the entire institution of binding agreements null and void. I think that any moral system with this level of \"clarity\" necessarily tends toward allowing absurdity like this, if not actively encouraging it.) This is the reason we require a (preferably impartial) judiciary: to determine the precedence and priority of various rights. For example, in the most famous example, my 1st Amendment right to yell \"Fire!\" in a crowded theater has been deemed, rightfully, to be trumped by society's collective right not to have its citizens deliberately cause physical harm to others. (You could very easily frame that collective right as my responsibility not to cause physical harm to others, and I would agree with it.)\n\nBut wait, you say, that's **government** determining rights! You're [I am] wrong! Rights *do* come from government!\n\nWell, not quite. As a civil society, we need some arbiter that we can all appeal to when our rights come into conflict. Since government has existed seemingly since time immemorial, we have attempted to harness its power to that end. And that's all government is, a way of aggregating power. We like to think that it represents and protects all of us, but government is very easily captured by people who have disproportionate power or wealth to begin with, making it a dangerous tool. Yes, we need government (or some other collectively agreeable arbiter) to decide questions of *whose rights or responsibilities win out in a conflict*, but that doesn't mean the rights in question came from government in the first place. Just because a corrupt government chooses not to protect a set of rights, or actively chooses to violate them (as many police forces seem to be ignoring our 4th Amendment rights, especially in seeking out citizens with drugs), **does not** mean that we didn't have that right to begin with. It is a precondition for challenging the government to the extent necessary to restore the rights. If, as you say, rights *come from government*, then we should ignore public outrage about the TSA, about the War on Drugs, about Ferguson and Baltimore and the myriad places where cops kill people of color, because those are all instances of government agents acting against private citizens. And if those agents, acting according to the rules of their agencies (which can't be doubted, since officers in these situations are extremely rarely prosecuted or punished), have denied citizens their rights, including their right to life, then that right must not have existed in the first place, right?"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Her immediate reaction was to dismiss all posts she saw as 'stupid' (that'd be the first page of 'hot' at time of posting). This, no doubt, has influenced my view.\n\nI'd like to highlight again that I am excited to have found this sub and I'll be visiting here often. But I'd like to discuss this idea first.\n\nP.S. I'm so meta I post requests for people to change my view about /r/changemyview on /r/changemyview as a critique of /r/changemyview.\n\nFirst Reply:\nOftentimes, the OP is the person presenting the most common viewpoint, and it's up to the commenters to find a unique argument against it. I say unique because usually, the OP has already considered the most common opposing ideas in advance. In fact, people present mainstream views so often that the moderators created Fresh Topic Friday in order to promote more unique and nonconforming posts. Furthermore, even though I think it's much more difficult to give a delta than to earn one, the system rewards earning them. That means that everyone is competing to have the most unique and compelling post, and the OP is competing to keep his or her view from being changed. I'm not sure how important  internet points are to people, but the scoring system is definitely set up to reward individuality and disincentives group think. This in in direct contrast to karma, which is often awarded to people who people already agree with. \nSecond Reply:\nthis is my experience in this sub: there are many different reasons why people post here. some post to be part of an echo chamber.  some post to defend and strengthen their views.  some are concerned that they are not considering enough perspectives and are looking for alternate views. so my first argument is that you are over-simplifying this sub.\n\nthe nature of reddit is present in this sub, what with upvotes, downvotes, etc. but popularity does not equate to deltas.  op decides whether to award a delta. in any case, discussions here typically last as long as the topic continues to get fresh perspectives.  if op doesn't hand out a delta where the popular view is that a delta is earned, or if the discussion devolves into semantics and hair splitting, interest in the discussion wanes.\n\ngroupthink depends on the adherence of the accepted opinion as dogma.  challenging these ideas in any real way is out of the question. the entire premise of this sub is to question the views put fourth.\n\nI could be wrong, but groupthink may also be controlled by a fascist regime, which this sub is not.  as far as reddit mods go, r/cmv has mods that seem to prefer the spirit of the law to the letter.  the sub's rules do not seem like they foster groupthink to me.\n\nso, we have a place where ideas are served up for public vivisection.  ideas can freely be challenged and only the op decides whether or not his or her view has been changed.  that seems closer to the socratic method than groupthink.  would you consider the socratic method \"teach me to groupthink\"?"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I absolutely do not mean to say that one is better than the other, only that there are fundamental physiological differences between men and women that feminists appear to disregard. Now, in my opinion feminism seeks to advocate that anything that men can do, women can also but only when its convenient. To me it seems like feminists want to have their cake and eat it too. I will give a few examples that I always think about to illustrate my point.\n\n1. The Ray Rice incident. What happened was unfortunate and of course he shouldn't have hit his wife. However, if this was Ray hanging out with another football player and knocked him out, this would not have been a story. Its because he punched a woman that this became a big deal. How can the feminist movement suggest \"Men should NEVER lay their hands on a woman\" but still say that men and women are equal. My answer is that its because men are generally stronger than women, but then that's my point. If you are going to advocate that they are equal then they should receive equal treatment. Again, CMV.\n\n2. Rape cases. In college I have been required to watch numerous sexual harassment videos and attend mandatory training seminars on sexual assault. In these videos they always paint the male as a bad guy and its always targeted towards men. Perhaps I have misunderstood something but if a guy and a girl are both under the influence and they decide to have sex, the girl can then decide the next day that maybe it wasn't a good idea and that the guy should have known better. The guy is then facing rape charges. Why is this on the guy? People use the phrase \"Victim Blaming\" and say that its not on the girl regardless of the fact that she drunk. So what if she had gotten drunk and drove her car into a tree. Can she then say \"Maybe that wasn't a good idea\" and then get off the hook?\n\n3. The draft. This one has also bothered me. According to the United States Selective Service Act, all men between ages 18-25 are required to register for the draft and may be picked for military service if the draft were to be implemented. Why are feminists all over the country not outraged about this? Shouldn't it be men AND women that are required to register for the draft? After all, men and women should be able to perform wartime duties equally right? It just seems like people pick and choose when its convenient for gender equality\n\nOf course there are certain things that should be equal. Wages, education, etc. However I feel that a push for gender equality in every aspect of life is fundamentally wrong. CMV!\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nTo be honest, I don't think there is a good answer to this one that doesn't ultimately boil down to having the cake and eating it too. The only thing that really makes sense as a response to this is that feminism is, at it's core, about advancing women's issues. The logical framework for advancing that idea is that everyone should be equal, but it is about making progress on issues where women are disadvantaged in some way to men, so your 3rd point isn't all that relevant; feminists might agree, in theory, that there are some areas where men are disadvantaged but they are not going to advocate for those issues to any noticeable extent because that isn't what the movement is about. You have to remember that feminism has a very large political/agend-ized component to it and the ultimate goal isn't to be as ideologically consistent as possible with regards to \"equality\", which is why you don't see feminists going to bat for \"men's rights\" issues. There is a reason why many feminists prefer to be called feminist than egalitarian; the focus is on women's issues. \nSecond Reply:\nI think the problem you're having is that you are assuming that along with feminism making life equally good for women, feminism also seeks (or should seek) to make it equally shitty. \n\nImagine this scenario: You give two little kids ice cream cones. The first one drops theirs before getting to take a bite. To make it fair and equal, you decide to knock second kid's cone to the ground. WTF? Why would you do that? Why would you chose to make the situation worse for either kid?\n\nAlong that line of thinking, it makes zero sense to advocate for it being okay to hit women or for women needing to register for the draft or to try to revoke the idea that a woman being drunk does not allow for consent. The vast majority of feminists think the draft is wrong, that consent is mutual, and that it is wrong for anyone to hit anyone. But, being feminists, their focus is on womens issues and the issues you describe above are really mens issues - men should not be hit, men cannot consent while drunk, men should not have to register for the draft. That's not to say that feminists don't care about mens issues, but it isn't their main focus. Complaining about that is like complaining that because you support a local food pantry you don't care about starving children in third world countries. You can care about both problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

To me, it's inflammatory anti-religious nonsense. I'm interested to see the other perspective. Have I misunderstood his quote? Is there something about human nature that I've misunderstood?\n\nFirst of all, I recognize that religion can cause good people to do bad things. It has done it many times and it will continue to do so. ISIS is the most obvious example right now, but there are countless other examples as well.\n\nWhat I can't understand is the last sentence:\n\n\nHe seems to be saying that **only religion** can cause good people to do bad things. This seems like total nonsense to me. TONS of things can cause good people to do bad things.\n\nFor example, soldiers who commit war crimes sometimes do so because they were \"just following orders,\" out of a sense of patriotism, or in order to protect their families.\n\nPoverty can make good people do evil things. \n\nDrugs can, too. They can temporarily taking away people's sanity, which causes them to do stupid things. Or drug addictions can drive people to such financial desperation that they're willing to do evil things to get their next hit.\n\n---\n\nLet me explain what I understand by \"good people\" and \"evil things.\" Perhaps I haven't properly understood what Weinberg meant by these words?\n\nA \"good person\" is someone who wouldn't normally do an evil thing without the influence of some outside force.

Any system of rituals or beliefs that people follow, including the patriotic following of orders you referred to, is a religion in this context.\n\nAs for your other examples, they might be countered in a small variety of ways, depending on the interpreter's beliefs, including something like the following:\n-Actions taken by a person in poverty in order to survive are not evil because the person has no alternative\n-People who are drugged are not themselves, in that they are controlled by the effects of the substance or addiction thereto.\nSecond Reply:\n&gt;convince me that religion is the only thing that can cause good people to do evil things.\n\nThat depends. When do you define a person by their actions whether they're good and when do you define them by their ideology?\n\nIndoctrination happens in mostly religious households and scenarios. Yes, political as well, but when it comes to beliefs and values I think religion does the indoctrination part a bit more. Especially with the whole \"hell if you don't believe\" idea.\n\nI think that someone isn't a good person if they have an ideology I disagree with. I think nationalists are bad, fascists are bad and so on. So when it comes to ideology, they're not good people doing bad things, they're bad people doing bad things.\n\n&gt;show me that I could've misunderstood Weinberg.\n\nI mean it's all about interpretation.\n\n\"Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.\"\n\nHe's certainly right when saying with or without religion, good people would do good things and bad people would do evil things.\n\nSome actions aren't evil, yet aren't good either. So maybe good people could do bad things yet not evil.\n\nTheft is an obvious example. It's not a good thing surely, and good people could do this whether or not they were religious, for different reasons. But it's hardly *evil*. Sometimes, theft is necessary or them to survive.\n\nCan't really think of anything else to add here.\n\n&gt;show me that my definitions of \"good person\" or \"evil thing\" are wrong (in the context of Weinberg's quote, of course).\n\nI suppose I already said what I thought on here.\n\n&gt;anything else that shows that anything I've said is wrong.\n\nI agree that drugs is a problem.

The movie then ends with clips from colleges over America having these kinds of parties. Now I can't imagine many people are foreign to party themes which now could be labelled as cultural appropriation- the most common being \"Cowboys and Indians\" which are nowadays quick to be labelled as **racist**. \n\nI guess I come to the opinion in my title from several ideas which probably all need to be challenged to change the view to which they lead. \n\n1- Displaying stereotypes for any purpose (even one as basic as to have a good time) ultimately does no harm, causing offense or even in extreme cases devaluing the root culture (although I would dispute that) is not the same as racism which is a prejudice against another person due to the colour of their skin- there is no discrimination here, other than bruised feelings no harm is done, Stereotypes are used in comedy against pretty much every imaginable definable group. \n\n2- Britain (arguably more so than America) is a cultural melting pot, appropriation goes both ways- India started playing Cricket for example, the person I was on the phone with raised the point that appropriation is particularly when something is taken from a culture without giving a contribution back to the culture from which it was taken- which makes sense. However I would argue that the use of stereotypes in this way is not taking anything from the culture in the first place- stereotypes only occasionally reflect current cultures often far removed from the circumstance of their use. It would be like arguing against a BDSM theme for a party because we are taking from that sub-culture without contributing anything (Before people jump out and point out the strawman here those involved in the BDSM community have faced a persecution and prejudice for their activities which although are changeable- which skin colour is not in most cases the basic premise is still close enough to be metaphorically accurate) \n\n3- Cultures benefit from cultural appropriation- it raises awareness and increases immersion in the native culture. \n\nCMV\n\nFirst Reply:\nNobody really cares about an honest exhange of culture. That's not really cultural appropriation.\n\nPeople get bent out of shape about it when people take bits and pieces of a culture out of context, without understanding it. Then, usually, those contextless items are commodified without the originating culture's consent or benefit.\n\nImagine the following scerario: some aliens decide to drop in on humanity, and they decide to wear coture dresses with pope hats and sneakers because they like keeping their jimmies cool, value comfort, and that's just a nice hat. Everybody everywhere would be snickering at their choice, but they would haughtily remind us that they are the more advanced species, so they are doing it right. Meanwhile, they take their dresses and pope hats back to the central galaxy and make more money than the earth is worth on their \"fantastic artisanship\" that they totally didn't just take directly from a Payless store. Earth remains disconnected from the galactic sphere, and all the dubbed virtual reality simulations they *do* send us back portray aliens dressed up as \"humans\" in their dresses and pope hats, and we all like cheese because the aliens found that hilarious. Those coture dresses are dismissed as 'tribal costumes' and we are the backward butts of jokes -- not the people who wore a damn pope hat and sneakers and called it 'cool'.\n\nOkay, so that's pretty absurd, but that's exactly what we tend to do to other cultures right here on earth.\n\nTo bring it back to your original BDSM party example, if people culturally appropriated from BDSM culture, it would suck. It would consist of taking things out of context, not caring about the important underlying things that make BDSM safe(r) and getting it (likely deadly) wrong. People would end up going to the hospital because they didn't know how to tie the ropes right, and didn't think it important to learn how before their hand turned black from constriction or something. They'd do things like wear a locking gag without having a safe command (like, \"hey spotter, if I pound my fist three times, that means break out the emergency shears and get this thing off me!\") so they end up choking to death. Now, everybody forms the opinion that BDSM is unsafe and should be banned, because just look at what happened!? *Obviously* that culture has something horribly wrong with it. That's cultural appropriation. Playing cricket worldwide is not.\nSecond Reply:\nI think you are misunderstanding the point of cultural appropriation.  It's not that only a member of a given culture has any right to use objects, designs, patterns, etc. that come from that culture.\n\nThe biggest problem is when other people borrow one piece of a culture without taking a moment to understand context.\n\nA prime example is the [war bonnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_bonnet), as it's frequently appropriated.  \n\nIn reality, a war bonnet is an object with deep cultural, or even spiritual importance.  They're used almost exclusively for ceremonial purposes.  The feathers aren't just given away, they're earned by acts of valor, or other service to the tribe.\n\nWhen people wear them just as some sort of [fancy hat](https://www.google.com/search?q=war+bonnet+hipster&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=839&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMIkeC0naXCxwIVCBGSCh3Q1wn-), that shows a deep lack of respect for another culture.  It's not just that you're taking an object, it's that you couldn't be bothered to even simply understand what that object actually means.\n\nIt would be somewhat similar to someone from another culture coming along, and deciding they like the way our western [military dress uniforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_uniform#/media/File:Household_Cavalry.jpg) look, right down to the sword and the medals, so they were going to go wear that to a party.  Not only would they probably get a lot of the details wrong, they're unintentionally pretending to be something they're not, and pretending to have earned an honor they haven't.\n\nThe other type of culture appropriation might be closer to what you're saying is ok, but I believe it's still a problem.\n\nIt's when people try to imitate a culture, but fail so miserably that they end up creating a caricature instead.  This is what you're talking about with things like \"Cowboys and Indians\"  parties.\n\nWe can imagine what if people did the same thing with British culture.  What if everybody's idea of a British person was Dick Van Dyke's character from Mary Poppins, stupid accent and all?  What if every time you met someone, they had to make some stupid joke in a Cockney accent, because that movie was the only thing they knew about your culture?\n\nRight now, that Dick Van Dyke stereotype exists, but it's different from more problematic stereotypes for one really big reason, which is that no one actually believes it's true, not really.  People have a huge amount of exposure to British culture, with TV shows, movies, news, and music made by British people introducing people to other aspects of British culture all the time.\n\nThe cultures that have problems with cultural appropriation don't have that big advantage.  Often the vast majority of the exposure they get is in the form of stereotypes, which means they're always fighting uphill against misconceptions and misunderstandings in order to actually give any sort of realistic information to others about their culture.  How much do you know about Native American culture from the United States that didn't come from old Westerns, bad Halloween costumes, or other culturally appropriated sources?"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

You say you feel like there must be something deeply broken about someone who is okay with it, only because you wouldn't be okay with it.\n\nSome people just see sex as a fun thing to do. They enjoy experiencing it with different people and don't necessarily need for it to be or feel like something more than that. \n\nIt is perfectly fine that you would not be comfortable with it, and there are obviously people who do this that have deep seeded emotional problems, just as there are people who don't have any sex that have deep seeded emotional problems, but having a lot of random sex doesn't necessarily say anything about the person.\n\nAllow other people to make their own decisions, and don't judge someones character or personality based on decisions they make that do not harm anyone.\nSecond Reply:\nWhile I'm sure this is true sometimes, some people just have different values than you. That doesn't necessarily indicate any insecurity or damage.\n\nPlenty of people just think sex is a fun activity that really has no moral or even any great emotional component to it. For people like this, having sex with everyone they pick up at a bar is no more or less a simple fun activity than going to the bar in the first place. \n\nSuch people, and I have met them, simply don't place any particular weight, in terms of their self worth or otherwise, on sex. It's just a hobby, like playing soccer. \n\nThat would be a difference of opinion, not an indication of insecurity. "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually rich white kids that already have a socioenconomic advantage. I was a regular upper-middle class guy who went to public school. I loved it. My school was great. We went on fun field trips, and even a trip to Europe. Homeschooling your kid is just insurance that he/she will be socially awkward, and disadvantaged. Lots of homeschooling involves religious indoctrination, and very one-sided opinions. In public school you are exposed to many different views, opinions, and types of people. These problems would be solved if everyone had to go to public school. Everyone would have an equal education, and equal opportunity.\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nMany folks here will talk about how not all public schools are the same.  I've lived in four different states, and can attest to that.\n\nBut more importantly *not all children are the same*.  Public school is geared toward the average- if you are above or below - or outside - of the norm, public school is often a difficult or unproductive place for you.\n\nOne of my children is an advanced learner.  She could read well before Kindergarten - mostly self taught.  Guess how boring K was for her.\n\nMy other daughter is extremely creative and high energy - sitting in a classroom all day was problematic for her.\n\nWe homeschooled our family 13 years, which allowed for personalized learning for both students that fit their learning styles.  We are an atheist family and were members of a secular homeschool group with roughly 300 families.  My kids now - one is a successful adult and the other has decided to transition into public school and is looking forward to high school.\n\nYour views on homeschool are, to put it bluntly, ignorant.  The kids are usually more socially adept as they are required to get along with kids of different ages as well as adults.  Kids learn from the older kids and mentor the younger ones.  \n\nBecause of the shortfalls of many public school systems, homeschool groups will often have a higher percentage of students with special needs.  In recent years we've seen quite an uptick of older kids with autism, for example.   So the perception many have of socially awkward/weird homeschool kids - remember the student may be in homsechool *because of a special need*.\n\nAlso - you show your ignorance again when you talk about how great your public school was. \"We had a trip to Europe!\"  Jesus, how oblivious to the rest of the world can you be.  If your school went to Europe, your public school was likely in an affluent area and was practically private school quality. \n\nMy school had a drug cop with a narc sniffing dog.\n\n\nSecond Reply:\nWhy should everyone get \"equal education, equal opportunity?\" If a kid doesn't want to learn, or doesn't want to succeed, why would you teach the same to him and to a kid who wants to excel and succeed in school? If someone want's to excel in their studies, they should be able to go to a \"better\" private school and get a \"better\" education.  \n\nPrivate school being \"better\" is also kind of vague. For education, you get out what you put in. If you try hard in school, you will get a  better education. Students in private schools most likely put more effort in to their education, so on average they come out in a better position than an average student in a public school. More effort = better education = \"better\" school."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

My main reason for having this view is due to how I think scientists would respond if something did happen that disproved the uniformity of nature. I believe if something suddenly changed, scientists would acknowledge this change and attempt further investigation into why this change was possible. I do not believe that scientists would simply outright deny that a change has happened, which is what I think they would do if they simply assumed the uniformity of nature.\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nScientists, as far as I know, have to assume uniformity or all the scientific theories fail. The thing is though, none have failed for that reason, so they really have evidence by now.\n\nBut if the universe would change in how it behaves, they would change their view. An assumption can be challenged and changed clearly.\nSecond Reply:\nA critical part of our current understanding of the universe has to do with the assumption that the laws of the universe work the same everywhere. \n\nFor example, take gravity. We can observe the effects of gravity on earth, and the effects of gravity in our solar system near Mercury. If we say that the laws should be the same everywhere, then we notice what we observe on earth is not true for Mercury. If scientists assume that gravity should work the same everywhere, then either our observations of Mercury are wrong or our understanding of gravity through Newton is wrong. Because of further exploration into gravity, Einstein resolved these issues with relativity and showed our observations of Mercury were correct, while our theory of gravity was incomplete. \n\nHowever, if scientists assume that maybe the laws of the universe don't work the same everywhere, then there's no reason to search for a new theory. Saying, \"that's just how it works over there\" is not science, it's a cop out. It's giving up and not searching for some unifying or universal theory that connects all observations. \n\nHence the search for the theory of everything, or some theory that unifies quantum mechanics and relativity. The search is on the basis that there should be uniformity in the universe, the laws that govern the small should be the same that govern the large. If scientists don't assume uniformity, then the search is baseless. "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I disagree with many of those I encounter who usually tend to also be of Korean descent when I don't get all too frantic about the idea of war on the peninsula. I feel as if this conflict, whether it is dormant or tense or whatever, must be dealt with in the future and we're just kicking the can down the road.\n\n1. Many people would die, regardless. People are dying under the famines and in the concentration camps. The longer we wait, the more people will suffer and die. Taking action as soon as possible would cause a high death toll but can potentially be made up for it by the fact that we'd be taking action soon and not \"whenever unexpected situations lead us to.\" Plus, it's arguable that simply leaving things be is 'inhumane'.\n2. Long-term, a unified Korea would turn into an economic powerhouse. We have two countries with very strong work ethics, a country with a ton of technological advancements and billionaire tech companies, another country with a ton of cheap labor (that can help jump start the economy after unification), lots of natural resources that would offset the costs, and infrastructure that must be built in the northern half of the peninsula. Some experts say a unified Korea can surpass Japan in economic power.\n3. I highly doubt China would be as uncomfortable having a unified, US-influenced Korea on their doorstep like people say they'd be. It's not like people aren't able to fly from Beijing to Seoul or New York City; they're aware of lifestyle in first world countries. China and South Korea are, contrary to popular belief, close allies. The number of refugees who would attempt to cross the Chinese border would probably be minimal if China expresses force in the region and South Koreans distribute food effectively and quickly. Furthermore, they know they'd have to go through sex trafficking and risk of death if they want to go through China... and then go where?\n\nI have a very open mind when it comes to this issue. The reason why I am posting this is because I see others worrying a lot when seeing news of a potential resumption of war while I feel a sense of hope. But my thinking may be entirely backwards. I'd like to see opposing arguments to this topic. Thanks for reading!\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nLet's go by your points one by one:\n\n1. It's easy to say this so casually when your entire way of life and your actual life itself is not what's at risk. A war with North Korea could trigger some very hard times for both North and South. Any economic benefits to be reaped would likely be in the long term. It's easy to call for sacrifice when you are not the one sacrificing. Who is to say unification will save lives? Violent, forced unification might cause extreme civil unrest, decades of terrorism, and continued or even accelerated loss of life on both sides. Unifying through full on war and unifying post-North Korean collapse are very different prospects that entail different likelihoods of success.\n\n2. That is true. Many experts predict that unification could be an economic boon. The same Goldman Sachs report that you are unknowingly referencing also states that this is under the assumption of most optimal circumstances (i.e. gradual and peaceful reunification). That circumstance is only most likely post natural internal North Korean collapse and not through violent takeover. North Korea is not ready to be a stable state if taken over.\n\n3. 60 years of consisted foreign policy doesn't change overnight. Their greatest concerns aren't cultural ones and more military. China, despite being a large coastal country, is landlocked militarily speaking by two great island chains - both of which are, in one way or another, under US control. The Korean peninsula is part of these chains (they form the mainland connection to the islands). North Korea falling further exacerbates America's cornering of China. It's a militarily strategic concern more than anything.\n\nAgain, I think it's important to emphasize this. It's easy to be hawkish when it's not your life that's being thrown away. Some things to keep in mind.\nSecond Reply:\nThe government of South Korea represents the people of South Korea, not the entire Korean peninsula.  War and re-unification would be terrible for South Koreans, even if it would probably help North Koreans in the long run.\n\nSouth Korea is already an economic powerhouse, they don't need the north for that. Taking on the cost of modernizing North Korea would put an incredible strain on the government and the nation as a whole.  It would hurt their economy for decades, not help it.\n\nSo war would cost many South Korean lives and significant destruction in South Korea, and it wouldn't gain them anything other than tremendous debt."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I think that to use taxpayer to further your own agenda is wrong.\n\nI think that instead of using money to fund public dialogues that they can put on public networks, this would allow them to talk about what problems they have with other parties with the the other parties having the ability to respond and rebuttle if they have proof that they are wrong. \n\nI am also not that smart so I would love to hear any problems with my logic! CMV reddit\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nNot sure how it works in canada, but if these are public funds, that means that each party gets a lump sum of money to design and run a political ad campaign, perhaps based on previous election results(?)  \n\nThe problem stems from drawing the line between what is attack and what is legitimate criticism.  If you were to say you're not allowed to criticize your opponent, then that would give the incumbent party a clear advantage, as no matter how poorly they govern or how harmful their policies, the opposition parties wouldn;t be allowed to criticize them or their policies.  Say they slashed education spending in half, laying off thousands of teachers and closing down hundreds of schools, causing overcrowding and poor performance.  Shouldn't the opposition be able to draw attention to that?  So, lets say you're allowed to criticize.  At what point does it become an \"attack\"?  Tone of speech and tone of voice are really intangible, judging attack from \"criticism\" is highly subjective, so you;d be leaving that line up to human judgement.  While I don't disagree, it just doesn't seem feasible to enforce an all out ban on \"attack\" ads.\nSecond Reply:\nYou have admitted in other comments that you don't know how to draw the line between an \"attack ad\" and legitimate criticism. Since you don't know how to draw that line, your proposed ban would be unenforceable. In addition, it would be illegal since the government has no business determining what people can and cannot say, short of explicit and serious incitement to criminal conduct. The First Amendment forbids censorship.\n\nHowever, there is a way to stop taxpayer money going to attack ads. Ban all taxpayer funding of any political campaign."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The dog-biting problem might not be as bad as I perceived it to be, especially in public spaces. So one could argue that a leash and breeding documentation is enough to have appropiate security. I really don't trust leashes when I cross a dog on the walkway and I feel like owners are really lax about them where I live. This belongs in their responsibilty, though. Anyway, I really enjoyed the little discussion with you guys. I consider my first CMV to be quite succesful :) I'll be giving out Deltas as soon as I figured out how.In germany there is a movement that demands muzzles only for especially \"aggressive\" breeds of dogs and every dogs' origin should be tested. Sounds like a good compromise for me.**\n\n\n\nHello there. I'm no native speaker so please have mercy :)\n\nAfter trying to be rational about this topic for a long time, I could only come up with the opinion stated in the headline. Dogs in public places with a jaw strong enough to harm children should always wear a muzzle. By law.\n\nHere's my explanation:\n\n\n\nDog owners tend to trust their dogs and they trust themselves in knowing their dog's behaviour. \nThey expose other people's integrity to their personal, arbitrary judgement call. \nWalking a dog in public, even on a leash, is essentially not different from holding a loaded gun in public without the intention to do harm. \nPeople would still avoid to be in shooting range. Why do people not shy away from dogs in the same way? \nThis is because they've made good experiences with dogs before and therefore underestimate the potential danger by a great margin. People who have been bitten will usually never trust big dogs again and will find that they changed their mind a little too late.\nUnmuzzled dogs on sidewalks or in parks are traumatic encounters for victims of dog bites.\n\n\n\nThere is also the problem of appropiate conviction. \n\nThe guy who purposefully carried a loaded gun in public and then killed someone by slipping his finger is much easier to convict than a dog owner whose only mistake was a short lack of attention for his dog. Should the dog owner be convicted with manslaughter? \nI know I wouldn't be able to lock someone up for this long only because he didn't pay attention. This is because there was no law protecting the dog owner from endangering other people in the first place. The idiot carrying the gun knew he was breaking the law the moment he stepped out the door. The dog owner didn't.\n\n\n\nAfter reading this you probably think that either I've been bitten by a dog or that I'm a dog-hating cat person. I'm neither. \n\nTo be honest I think that muzzles on dogs look very sad and I would rather have a better soultion for all this. However, I have a huge hate for frivolous dog owners who think that because they're not scared of their dog, I shouldn't be either.\n\n\nSo please change my view. :)\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nI don't think muzzles are a good solution to the problem, honestly. Even if you managed to get something like this enacted, it would **have** to be strictly limited to [basket muzzles](http://www.all-about-cane-corso-dog-breed.com/images/muzzles/Rottweiler-dog-wire-muzzle-Handmade-wwell-ventilated-gearM9-big.jpg) which still allows the dog to bite if someone sticks their fingers into the muzzle (most likely children). And even wire basket muzzles can be dangerous or uncomfortable for the dog. I just don't see how that's justified given that less than 1% of dogs will injure a person while out in public. Especially considering that for many dogs, being out in public at some point during the day is mandatory.\nSecond Reply:\nSince you're from Germany I looked for some European sources for my argument, which is that regulating everything so that the risk comes to 0% is *extremely* expensive so it's important to look at the risk factors involved.\n\nTake a look at [this study](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/117/3/e374.short) about dog bites from the Medical University of Graz, Austria. (I know it isn't Germany, but it was the best I could find and I think the analysis will still be applicable.) The incidence rate of dog bites among children (which is your main concern) is 0.5 per 1000, which is very small but still worth analyzing more thoroughly. Well, it's the one year-olds who are at the highest risk of bites, and 82% of the dogs were familiar to the children, i.e. family pets. \n\nMost one year-olds aren't walking around outside unsupervised, they're with their parents when in public, usually being wheeled around everywhere. And, as the article shows, the risk decreased quickly with age. So requiring muzzles in public to mitigate this very minor risk is a huge overreaction.\n\nEdit: Added details about the study."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

People can come to the U.S. as tourists from several countries, not just Mexico, completely legally. They then can slip into the sea of people and stay, illegally.

Who is to say he wouldn't endorse policies that would make it easier for both him and his kids to double their fortune?\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nYour opening statement regarding him being a punchline is an irrelevant statement.  Every president is a punchline to the opposition. Reagan was pretty great and considered a complete joke.  People derided Clinton and he did an admirable job.  Wilson was mocked but was mostly right.  Lincoln was vilified but righteous.  \n\nThe deference between politics and business have never been much.  In most places people transition from successful businessman to school board or governor all the time.  Trump may be skipping traditional step but that does not make him unqualified.  I don't think you would argue that being governor of Nebraska for two years would suddenly change your opinion of the man. \n\nAs far as his particular views on immigration and defense, he is not saying anything that other candidates have said in the past.  Don't be shocked if you hear other republican candidates start to mimic him if he remains popular.  Ones side extremist is the other sides voice of reason.  \n\nYour last statement concerning the rich shows a bias.  Democrats and republicans bemoan money and politics while participating in the corruption.  \n\nI would be surprised if you are persuaded to CYV but I think you should recognize the reasons you listed are not evidence for you view but simple evidence of your view.

They get to power and realize how little they really can do because of the way the power steucture in America is set up.\n\nUniversal health care became Obamacare, which is a very little improvemwnt and still leaves the money machine which is the health industry intact.\n\nObama and Clinton were also very active militarily and hatdly pacifists. Bush didn't introduce serious attempts to ban abortions. Status quo prevailed, and the wars and trade agreements that are negociated far from the white house took place.\n\nThat would be the Trump presidency.

If someone leaves a marriage, it means they are unhappy with it, or have lost feelings for the other person. And like I said in my first statement, making the person stay in marriage until a joint divorce is (if ever) made by the threat of the person leaving losing a lot of money and/or possessions will only make the marriage worse and worse, leaving 1 or both of the people suffering for years. \n\nAnother reason why this is bad is if one person is unhappy in their marriage, and the spouse is forcing them to stay by means of threatening legal action, will leave the unhappy spouse in a terrible marriage for years, or possibly for the rest of their lives.\n\nChange my View Reddit!\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nThere are many marriages where one spouse has given up his or her career to take care of children. In case of a divorce this person is now at a tremendous financial disadvantage because re-entering the workforce after several years can be difficult. Do you think it would be unfair if you were caught in such a situation without marketable skills?\n\nAlso let's say a couple has joint finances and are both working. Should the spouse pursuing the divorce not be entitled to his or her share of the money in the finances?\n\nAdditionally, decisions regarding custody of children can be difficult as well and can be considered punitive by some in the divorce process. An even split of custody isn't always a good outcome if one spouse is abusive. If one spouse intends to move, this would put unnecessary strain on children. All of these factors need to be considered in some way.\n\nUltimately, without such measures in divorce proceedings, a stay at home parent is at a disadvantage and financially will be discouraged from pursuing a divorce. This allows the other spouse to act in any manner he wishes, knowing his spouse will not leave him without great difficulty. Divorce proceeding should not be considered punitive, but should be considered the pursuit of the most just outcome for all parties involved (both spouses and the children). Your argument centers on the fact someone can be caught in an unhappy marriage for fear of losing money/children. But your solution doesn't solve this problem, someone caught in a relationship with an abusive or cheating spouse will have no recourse regarding custody of kids or financial compensation and therefore will be discouraged from pursuing a divorce.\nSecond Reply:\nOkay, first, you are buying into the stereotypical myth that one \"loses everything\" in a divorce. This isn't true. What happens is that the assets that were jointly acquired are divided between the two parties. A lot of people are unhappy at having to share with someone they're not having that loving feeling towards. Understandable. But the other person isn't taking everything from them. Yes, there are some acrimonious divorces where there's a bitter battle down to who gets the last fork, but that is the fault of both parties involved more often than not, because they're usually both acting like bitter babies out of hurt and anger and not handling things with any sort of reason or accord. \n\nAlso, you seem to think there's only 1 or 2 reasons for marriages to end. There's MANY. Falling out of love is but one. There's also emotional abuse, physical abuse, cheating, neglect, etc etc etc. If you've invested yourself, not just financially but emotionally as well, and put your everything into it, do you really think the other person should be able to just take whatever they want and walk away?\n\nI like that in some countries you have to be separated for a length of time before you're allowed to divorce, because that time can allow for cooler heads to prevail and things can end without all the fighting. That's not to say it's easy, in the majority of cases, there's going to be some pain involved. But when you can step back and catch your breath, it's easier. \n\nNow on to the alimony bit, which is what you seem to be confused about. A few facts you seem to be unaware of: First, alimony is NOT automatic. It has to be requested, and then a judge will look at the situation and history of both parties and make a decision from there as to whether or not alimony will be granted and how much. There's about a dozen and a half factors that go into deciding alimony amounts. And there IS a reason for alimony. It is NOT a punishment. It is their to help compensate for unfair economic effects of a divorce. If one spouse sacrificed their career in order to support the other while they pursued their own, or pursued their education, that spouse is put at a distinct disadvantage by a divorce. Alimony levels the playing field a bit. If there's no prenup or other such agreement already in place, the court looks at many factors, like the length of the marriage, the ability of each spouse to earn income, the phsyical, financial, and emotional states of each party, and so many more. Then the amount and length of time the alimony will be paid is decided. \n\nAlso, you seem unaware that marriage is legal contract as well as an emotional commitment. When one party breaks that contract, there's legal ramifications. You cannot make legally binding commitments and just walk away from them...and if you have any integrity at all, you don't make any sort of commitment or promise and then just walk away without expecting to make some recompense. \n\nAnd no one is kept in a marriage by these threats you speak of. If they stay because they're afraid of divorce, that's their own choice and they're making themselves miserable. The courts will divide the assets, not the spouses, and there will be some losses for both sides. That's how life works. When you build something together with another person, you don't get to just take all the marbles and leave when you decide you don't want to play any more. You BOTH contributed, and you BOTH stand to lose some of what you built. \n\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In searching for critiques of those statistics I found [this article](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/02/defensive-gun-ownership-gary-kleck-response-115082.html#.Vdm1n_lVhBc) that lays out some criticisms of the first article's source study, along with a rebuttal from another journalist who's written on the topic.*\n\nI believe that:\n\n1. You, or someone in your family, are more likely to be killed by your gun either purposefully or accidentally than you are to use the gun against an attacker successfully in self-defense.\n\n2. Therefore, if your goal is to make yourself and/or your family safer, then choosing to keep a gun in your home explicitly for that purpose is an irrational decision.\n\n\nI do believe there is one exception to this. If you have a particular reason or belief that you are likely to be attacked, then, since the odds of being attacked have increased dramatically, then it may be rational to have a gun in the house for self-defense. For example, if you have a stalker. If you have received threats on your life. If you have any reasonable belief that someone will try to harm you specifically. If government or police forces have broken down. Basically, if the odds change so that for you the risk of you or your family being attacked is greater than the risk of having a gun in the house, then it would be rational to have a gun.\n\nBut we do know, statistically, on average, that is not the case. So for the average person, the risks are such that the rational decision for maximizing safety is to not keep a gun.\n\nI further believe that if you get other uses out of the gun other than just self-defense, then the other added benefits of having a gun would make it rational to keep one in the house. For example, if somebody was a hunter and or target shooter and they get a lot of joy out of their hobby, that could be worth the risk of gun ownership. Or even if someone cited tradition, or the need of an armed populace as a check on the government, that too could be a perceived benefit to them that makes the safety risk worthwhile. I'm strictly speaking about what's the best decision for maximizing personal and family safety.\n\nChange my view by showing me that the risk of harm to you or your family is lower by having a fire arm in the house.\n\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nI think there are more exceptions to that rule than you care to admit.\n\nIf you've ever lived in the country, you know how valuable a gun can be. It is not uncommon for people to wander up your driveway and check to see if anyone is inside the house. More than once, I've been saved from robbery (or worse) by brandishing a rifle. But the best part is I've never had to shoot anyone. I've never even had to shoot *at* anyone. For most purposes, just the sight of a gun is enough.\n\nSo I'd argue that it is very rational to keep a gun in your house for self-defense purposes. However, it could be considered irrational (considering the statistics you mentioned) to keep ammunition.\nSecond Reply:\nThe [chance of a random American being killed](http://blog.nj.com/njv_paul_mulshine/2009/09/madds_bad_with_the_facts.html) by a drunk driver is about one in 100k in any give year.\n\nBut the chance of *ME* being killed by a drunk driver is vastly smaller.  I'm almost never driving after 10pm, don't drive much on rural roads, and most of my driving is on low-speed surface streets.\n\nStatistics are great  for getting overall trends, but suck at predicting individual outcomes.\n\nIf I lived alone (i.e., no spouse or family), were well-trained in handling firearms safely, with no history of depression, the odds would be dramatically different than the ones you list.  \n\nIn that case, it would be perfectly rational for me to have a gun, since I'm not likely to use it to commit suicide, my non-existent kid isn't going to find it and accidentally kill his friend, and I'm not going to wake up without knowing my non-existent wife slipped out to satisfy a Ben and Jerry's craving and shoot her because I think she's a burglar.\n\nThere just aren't a whole lot of circumstances that make it likely that my gun would be used in error.\n\nYou point may hold that it's irrational *for the average person* to own a gun.  But for many real people it's completely rational."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

However, learning Mandarin Chinese, Japanese or Korean is more valuable than learning any European language.\n\n\n-Travel\n\nIt's easier for Europeans to learn English and harder for East Asians to learn English.\nMost Europeans at the very least speak basic English, and most East Asians only know English words.\nYou can travel across Europe only knowing English, but in East Asia it helps more to know the language.\nI don\u2019t consider places like South America and China to be developed enough to travel through, other than tourist spots catering to English speakers.\n\n\n-Media\n\nWhen it comes to media, East Asian countries have their own isolated worlds. Going through their music, films, television and books can almost feel like visiting an alien world since so little reaches the west. \nSpecifically Japan and South Korea are economic powerhouses and understand the importance of [soft power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power), and as a means produce a lot more films, music, games, comics, literature and TV than any European or South American country.\n\n\n-Availability\n\nEuropean languages have more speakers than East Asian languages, but most Europeans already speak English.\n\nFor an American there may be a lot Latin American immigrants, but there are Asian immigrants everywhere in the world.\n\nEast Asian languages might not be as widely available, but their populations are educated, travel a lot, and have [more native speakers than other European languages.](http://i.imgur.com/SDrGTr8.jpg)\n\n\n-Difficulty\n\nEast Asian languages are said to be notoriously hard by Europeans, but with technology in just the recent years it has become a lot easier. Chinese characters, hangul and Japanese writing systems can now be learned on your smartphone by playing games with apps like memrise or anki.\n\nA lot of European-language speakers complain about how complex European grammar tends to be, whereas East Asian grammar often is \u201clogical\u201d and straight to the point (with exceptions, as any language). \nIf you disclude writing systems, East Asian languages would be easier to learn as a spoken language than European ones for someone who has experience with neither.\n\n\n-Cultural benefits\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if their worlds are isolated from ours.\nLearning a widely different language helps us understand the structures of our own languages. Learning about a completely different culture helps us understand the uniqueness of our own culture. \n\nEuropean cultures are often so similar that we only tend to think of simple things as being differentiating between countries, but what makes us unique as westerners becomes much more apparent when compared to a country at the other side of the world.\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nI don't know if you live in the US or in the EU or whatever. But I think you miss something very simple. There is value in learning a language that you can use, there is less value in learning a language that you won't use. \n\nIn the case of an European, (I'm taking the Dutch as an example) \nGermany is our biggest trading partner, there is value in learning German for economic reasons. Germany is bordering to us, increasing the amount of times we meet, there is value in learning German for social reasons, like vacations or friendships. which isn't there for Asian languages, because the people aren't vacationing that often in Asian countries as they do in our neighbouring countries. People that we meet in Europe often can speak an european language, even the ones that have origins in Asia, so it is easier to just keep to learning European languages if you are planning to stay inside of Europe. \n\nOne of the best ways to learn a new language is immersion. It is easier to do so in Europe as an European. We have English, French and German as language options on TV for example. And if TV isn't enough we can just travel a few hours and go to a country where the language is spoken. While there is barely any chance to immerse yourself in Asian languages the same way.\n\nSecond Reply:\nHere is the small problem. it is far easier for a Chinese person to learn fluent English than a western to learn any level of fluent Chinese. \n\nWhen those two meet, guess what the language will be?\n\nEnglish. \n\nI don't really advocate that it is better to learn Spanish than Mandarin, but I would say that there are a lot of people in China who know a little bit of Mandarin that are getting out compete by Chinese who speak English a lot better than westerns speak Mandarin.

It seems unfair that the SAT would include this in the math section. Some will argue that it makes sure students are \"well rounded,\" but it's incredibly unfair to use this to test a student's aptitude for college. When I was in high school, I had an 89% overall GPA. I got mid-range scores on the reading and writing sections of the SAT, but did very poorly on the math section. Because of this, I was denied admission to many colleges which I applied to. I understand that my scores in reading and writing were average, but it was the low math score which really hurt my chances of admission. This might seem like a personal argument, but the fact remains that I'm sure many students would agree with me. I understand including algebra and geometry, but I don't see why they include trigonometry. This is a person's future which they are dealing with.\n\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nTrigonometry is a basic staple of most college level math courses and should have been touched upon enough in Geometry that you could do well on it. An SAT score is meant to compliment your work in high school. The SAT itself isn't a measure of what you have learned in high school, but more of a measure of what you still need to learn. Low grades combined with a high SAT score show that you know more of what you are required to learn in college and can be moved ahead with courses though you may fail to do work.\n\nThe problem you have isn't that you didn't do well on the SAT, it's that you were average with everything else. You weren't accepted to colleges not because you didn't do well on the SAT, but because you didn't show that you were a hard enough worker to make up for any deficit you might have had.\nSecond Reply:\nI get and understand that Math is not your strong point, that's great and fine, however it is mine.  I got my undergrad in Math and I am working on my Masters in Stats, but just because I don't see myself as needing reading or writing that does not mean that others feel the same way.\n\nMy personal opinion of the SAT and ACT is less that is it to make a \"well rounded\" person and more to set a bar for entrance into selective schools.  To your opening point, the SAT did not prevent you from going to college it just prevented you for attending a more selective college, one that desires a higher level of math knowledge than the ones that accepted you.\n\nIt has little to do with you and more to do with the statistics of placing people.  If someone has a better understanding of math they will be able to understand more things in general (all else being held constant).  "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

There's a ridiculous amount of generalization in your post and none of it is particularly true. \n\nFirst of all, no one NEEDS sex. Sex is a desire. It is part of a biological system designed to  propagate the species, of course, but it's a desire based system. You will not die without it. You NEED oxygen. You NEED water. You do not NEED sex. You want it. You'd survive just fine without it. \n\nSexual drive, libido, it's a very individual thing that varies from person to person even without the myriad varying factors, like hormones and medications and traumatic experiences, etc. You've apparently taken women's reaction to you, personally, to extend to all women and decided it's because we don't need/want sex as much as men. Which is nonsense. Most women, like most men, enjoy sex and desire it. If they don't particularly seem to want sex with you (and I'm saying IF, not assuming...just guessing based on this post and your responses), that doesn't mean they don't want or enjoy sex at all. \nSecond Reply:\nThis is a huge generalization of both men and women. For some people, sex is a take it or leave it type of thing. For others, it is something more akin to a need.\n\nI know plenty of women who are sex-positive and need to have sex in order to feel fulfilled and satisfied in their relationships. I know men who don't need to have sex on some kind of regular basis.\n\nI think this perception of yours stems mostly from societal expectations of both men and women. Men are raised to feel like they should see sex as some kind of insatiable hunger (boys being boys). Where as women are raised to view sex as something damaging to them and that they should strive to save for their one true love (see: the idea that vaginas can be stretched out by too much sex to uselessness)."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Now I understand that \"hustlin\" can translate into any race/culture as just another medium in which to get money. But black culture seems to value poverty and the 'hustlers mentality'. If I turn on the radio to HOT107.5, I am very likely to find the radio announcer perpetuating this stereotype. \"Hustlin'\"  is glorified while education is not. \n\nThere is very little initiative towards the Arts, STEM, etc. Sports/athleticism seems to be the major avenue to which black people feel they can ascend from poverty. \n\nHip-hop is attached to black culture, and it seems that black culture (which has churned out great literary works and ideas) cannot distance itself from hip-hop. I don't believe hip-hop is bad. Quiet the opposite, but it is the black community that has embraced the hip-hop scene and made the world associate it with us &amp; crime/street life. Even TV shows portray this, everything from sitcoms to drama. You are less likely to find the token-black guy, and more likely to find the 'reformed thug'. \n\nBlack people want to be included in mainstream society, yet reject it at the same time. We want to have black casts in popular TV series or movie franchises, but we also want black-only things. I believe you can't have your cake and eat it too. America works best as a soup, not a salad. \n\nThe black community has yet to tackle black on black crime, yet it sees police brutality as more important. We HATE to be labeled as thugs, criminals, yet social media has only made our stereotypes more transparent.\n\n/r/blackpeopletwitter, albeit funny, is also embarrassing because black people are again perpetuating a stereotype or being cast a stereotype. Tweets about is 'how fire is my mixtape, 'bruh' 'nigga this, nigga that'. We have normalized it to the point weere teenage white girls are saying \"nigga\" and \"bitch\" like it's a pronoun. Political action by black tweeters seems to also alienate other groups of people. The issue of police brutality for example seems to be marketed/targeted as a black-only issue. Again, creating polarizing opinions/slogans like \"All Lives Matter\" \n\n\n* Black nationalism\n\nIn my eyes, black nationalism is dangerous because it perpetuates a lot of misinformation and half truths. It is on the scale as 'white washing' history. Social media has become a breeding ground for misinformation by/for the black community. Black nationalism will ultimately lead to polarizing the nation.\n\ni.e. \"Ancient Egyptians were black, Jesus was black, Mohammed was black, etc\" or teaching talking about slavery only in terms of black v. white. \n\n\n* Homophobia/Racism/Misogyny\n\nAs I stated earlier, the black community hasn't made a very active attempt in stemming the mindset that mainstream hip-hop culture perpetuates. All I can tell you is from my own experience but homophobia and misogyny  seems to be rampant in the black community. Not so much in terms of violent actions but insults through social media and subtle homophobic/misogynistic remarks made on radio and TV. \n\nFirst Reply:\nI think your analysis failed to address the historical roots of your points. You don't address where the stereotypes originated, you don't discuss the long term generational effects poverty and mass incarceration have on communities, and you fail to realize how social media has allowed for the dissemination of information on issues black communities face to non-black communities. \n\n&gt;\"Hustlin'\" is glorified while education is not.\n\nWell, this is what happens when you have an education system that has time and time again failed black communities in urban areas. I highly recommend listening to [this](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/562/the-problem-we-all-live-with) episode of This American Life. It touches on the huge discrepancies between the education white kids receive and black kids receive in St. Louis but it's just one example that can be applied to urban communities across the country. \n\n &gt;However I also believe that police brutality should not be the pressing issue within the (urban) black community. I believe that the black community is a ''riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma''. And that movements like Black Lives Matter only polarize the country. The American consciousness does not change overnight.\n\nPolice brutality is another example of how a system that is meant to protect people fails to protect black communities. I don't understand why you think it's not important to address. Mike Brown's case is not only a case of a white cop killing a black boy, but an example of economic and social disparities in white and black neighborhoods. Black Lives Matters isn't about polarizing the country. Why should this issue even be polarizing? That's the main problem. Why are people still arguing that systemic racism isn't an issue in this country? That's what BLM protestors are trying to move away from - we aren't arguing anymore that race is a problem in this country, right now we're trying to address the problems of the institutions in this country. And to be honest it is working. After the two BLM protestors shut down Bernie Sander's event what happened? He released his platform on racial justice and has talked about mass incarnations and the issues of private prisons in this country. \n\nI think you barely grazed the surface with your analysis. It's important to look into the psychological effects systemic racism has on communities. Black communities don't trust the very institutions you think we should trust (education, police force, etc). Saying black communities should cooperate and let go of very important aspects of our culture (hip-hop, music, sports) is in and of itself oppressive. Black people in this country were never given the power to address these issues for themselves, they weren't even considered people since the day they were brought to this country, because of this we have to rely on our communities to fight for ourselves and make these issues more heard. [Here's](http://www.thenation.com/article/black-lives-matter-is-a-demand-not-a-plea/) a piece that highlights why that is important. \n\n\nSecond Reply:\nWow, there is a lot to respond to here.  I'll start out by tackling it point by point.\n\n&gt; There is very little initiative towards the Arts, STEM, etc. Sports/athleticism seems to be the major avenue to which black people feel they can ascend from poverty.\n\nFirst off, sports are actually one of the more genuinely meritocratic institutions in this country.  Although realistically most black people will never become professional athletes, sports in school often come with requirements to maintain a certain GPA, and there are a variety of scholarships that colleges offer for athletes.  This is a minor nitpick, but it's not wrong to suggest sports can help some black people out of poverty.\n\nBut that's a minor point.  More importantly, the idea that black people just don't value education is wrong.  Empirically, factually wrong.  [Here is a very interesting article on the subject](http://www.theroot.com/articles/politics/2013/01/acting_white_theory_black_academic_achievement_based_on_other_factors.html), discussing whether or not black people have a disdain for education and view it as \"acting white.\"  What the various studies cited in the article found is that black students value education as much or even slightly more than their white counterparts.  Black students were more likely to report that their friends wanted them to go to college, a majority of all black students personally plan to go to college, and by far the most common reason for not going was being unable to afford it.  Black people were even slightly more likely to consider high-achieving students \"cool\", and a greater proportion of black people said that their friends would be supportive if they received good grades than white people.  To quote the article:\n\n&gt; For more than three decades, researchers have found that black students consistently exhibit more positive attitudes about education than white students, contrary to their lower levels of academic achievement.\n\nThis raises the question about why black academic achievement is lower.  One possibility is that schools in black neighborhoods have much less funding and larger class sizes that make individualized attention difficult.  Another could be a feeling of being unsafe, which, the linked article notes, is correlated with decreased academic achievement.  \"Stereotype threat\", a phenomenon noted by Claude Steele and discussed at length in his book *Whistling Vivaldi*, describes the way anxiety about confirming a stereotype can result in worse performance on a given task.  Whatever the reason(s), it is not \"black culture\".\n\nNow, on to another argument of yours, OP:\n\n&gt; The black community has yet to tackle black on black crime, yet it sees police brutality as more important. We HATE to be labeled as thugs, criminals, yet social media has only made our stereotypes more transparent.\n\nRates of violent crime are higher in black communities than white ones.  The problem is that viewing crime in the lens of \"personal responsibility\" or otherwise simply blaming criminals, punishing them, and calling it a day, is intellectually bankrupt and morally irresponsible.  And chalking it up to some vague \"black culture\" and then flooding the neighborhood with cops is certainly not a rational response.  Asking why black on black crime is a problem is a legitimate question, however.  Let's investigate.\n\nFirst, most violent crimes are intraracial- white people are generally more likely to kill other white people, and black people are generally more likely to kill other black people.  You've likely heard this point before so I won't spend much time on it.\n\nOf course, you can counter that black people still commit higher rates of violent crime, and you would be right.  However, the explanation is not as simple as \"black culture\".  [According to one study](http://ann.sagepub.com/content/623/1/93.short):\n\n&gt; Using data from the National Neighborhood Crime Study to examine the racial-spatial dynamic of violence for neighborhoods in thirty-six U.S. cities, the authors demonstrate that along with the social and economic conditions that exist within neighborhoods, proximity to more disadvantaged and especially racially privileged (heavily white) areas is particularly critical in accounting for the large and visible differences in violence found across neighborhoods of different colors.\n\n[Another study](http://law.ku.edu/sites/law.drupal.ku.edu/files/docs/law_review/v57/7.0-Peterson_Final.pdf) finds that \"gross rates of violence are two and a half to five times greater in the three types of non-white neighborhoods than in white areas (Figure 5), but these differences drop to a maximum of one and three quarters after critical community conditions are taken into account (Table 2).\"  These critical community conditions?  Differences in access to external resources (such as home loans) and socioeconomic disadvantages.\n\n[A different study](http://sf.oxfordjournals.org/content/76/1/93.short) finds that unemployment and underemployment are significantly correlated with willingness to commit crime.  [Black unemployment rates are consistently roughly twice white unemployment rates.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/08/21/through-good-times-and-bad-black-unemployment-is-consistently-double-that-of-whites/)  [A white criminal and a black person without a criminal record have roughly the same chance of being hired.](http://csgjusticecenter.org/reentry/posts/researchers-examine-effects-of-a-criminal-record-on-prospects-for-employment/)  It's nearly impossible for black people with criminal records to get jobs, and with the War on Drugs, large numbers of black people have been swept up into the criminal justice system as felons, and permanently denied access to the economy.  Between violent criminals and nonviolent drug offenders, 1/3 of black men will be incarcerated at some point in their lives, which means 1/3 of black men will be disadvantaged in finding employment, and more likely to commit crime as a result.\n\nYou say the black community needs to tackle black on black crime.  And I agree!  It needs to tackle black on black crime by addressing it at its sources- mass incarceration, poverty, lack of services, police brutality, and segregation.  But of course, we have movements dealing with those issues.  One such movement is #BlackLivesMatter.\n\nAnyway, moving on:\n\n&gt; The issue of police brutality for example seems to be marketed/targeted as a black-only issue. Again, creating polarizing opinions/slogans like \"All Lives Matter\"\n\nIt is true that white people are often victims of police brutality and mass incarceration.  It's also true that black people are disproportionately victims of those things.  And another thing that is true: black people are more likely than white people to even acknowledge that a problem exists.  By calling attention to a problem white people largely don't want to realize exists, a problem born from post-civil rights movement racism masquerading as a concern for \"law and order\", of course BlackLivesMatter is going to be polarizing.  But it needs to be BlackLivesMatter because of the racist origins of our current system of mass incarceration, the disproportionate police brutality, and the havoc racism continues to inflict on black communities.  To ignore the racial aspects of our current police brutality problem is to fall short of being able to fix it and the system around it."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Well, not in the big scheme of things anyway. Human endeavors such as developing a cure for cancer or ending world hunger are all very noble, but futile nonetheless. Maybe we'll get there someday, but does it matter? For now it seems like it does, but when our species dies out it won't. God probably doesn't exist and nobody gives a shit. \"You create your own meaning in life\" is wishful thinking, because your \"meaning\" ultimately doesn't really matter to anyone or anything but humanity at large, if that. And if it doesn't matter, it's not meaningful.\n\n\nI'd love to be wrong on this one, so go ahead and change my view.\n\nFirst Reply:\nSo, I think \"meaning\" is kind of just a byproduct of our evolution. Because, the way you're talking about it is sort of the way most people address this concept, like it's some sort of transcendent sentiment, that there's a purpose that can exist forever and we're not a part of it and that eternal purpose is the only important thing.\n\nBut, I mean, that's just some feeling that we have, like envy or boredom. \"Meaning\" the concept as opposed to \"meaning\" the feeling, as far as I can see, has no need to be attached or correlated to some arbitrary concept like \"time.\"\n\nYou know when you're sorta YouTube surfing and you start on some silly video and later end up on a 2 hour documentary on some huge scientific conquest we've done in the last decade sometimes? Or sometimes, it's the opposite, but often, you'll watch a video about puppies playing patty cake with cats and then suddenly **here's all the physics ever.** (EDIT: So re-reading this, I realized that at this part, I accidentally did it in the same order twice so it's not the opposite at all but I'm sure reddit will forgive me just like they forgave that one guy who misspelled his name)\n\nOne of those videos I watched, I think, was about what's outside our observable universe. It started out with stuff outside of what we can see because of expansion, and that was like \"meh\" because it was mostly, as far as we can tell, just our stuff, same composition, pretty uniform except for some cold spot that could be evidence of a multiverse or something. And then they started talking about the multiverse. And how there are totally different temporal dimensions that our temporal dimension exists in and how our \"forward\" in time is \"up\" one level up or some crazy arbitrary dimension.\n\nLike, you just sorta realize that time is **totally and completely arbitrary.** People put so much emphasis on time being such a huge thing, like if we don't last until the end of the universe in 10^gazillion millennia or whatever they calculated it to be, we don't matter, but no, it's just another arbitrary dimension, it's like saying that unless I'm really, really fat, I don't matter and I'm totally meaningless because I don't take up as much space in this dimension.\n\n###So...\n___\n\nBeing dependent on time is so, so arbitrary. Time is just a randomass mechanic that our minds just sorta found it convenient to interpret. I mean, everything about our universe is just interpretations. These colors are just radiation. There's radiation going directly into my eyes right now and some physical law has allowed a mysterious thing called consciousness to emerge from the soup inside my head to make what we call an image out of that. Time is like color, we're just looking at entropy and somehow, the evidence of less entropic states enters each of our consicous states in order to make memories.\n\nMy take on this is if there is a meaning out there, you wouldn't know. Meaning, as far as I can define it, is ability to have some sort of effect. I'm not sure if logic even exists outside of our universe, like I don't know if true and false are just suddenly not the only states of things outside here, but as far as I can tell, the best definition is having an effect, and when you have rigorous laws and logic, everything you do affects everything. The universe is just a structure, time included, just like a bunch of blocks you put together to make a Jenga tower that relies on every piece to stay up except Jenga is literally the opposite of that, but everyone always uses it as a metaphor for engineering so w/e. That's what Chaos theory is, if you change anything or remove anyone, suddenly the universe doesn't exist. It's gone. If someone from outside the universe came in and made you not exist, literally the ENTIRE UNIVERSE is gone. Aliens outside of our observable universe but still in our universe would just, without even knowing why, also stop existing because they rely on your existence.\n\nThat's fucking crazy, like, right now, some pregnant alien overlord is worried about their leadership and their baby and they're not worried about me at all, but if it weren't for me RIGHT FUCKING NOW being a thing, they would be freaking DEAD. They don't even KNOW.\n\nI'm not even sure I'm trying to change your mind at this point, I started typing and then I just got really enthusiastic, but yeah, you really should realize that\n\n###TL;DR (Honestly, don't read the above, it's a ramble because I fucked up and I'm too lazy to fix it)\n\n\"not lasting forever means we're meaningless\" is so super duper arbitrary when you realize how non-unique and special time is. It's just, like, another thing. Like a burger. It's like saying if I don't always have everything to do with this burger, I am meaningless, from cow to slaughter to consumption. Why a burger? Why not a sandwich? Or a late night television show? At the very least, if we're meaningless, it's not because we won't last forever.\nSecond Reply:\n'Human existence is futile.' But to find meaning is what makes us human. To be an animal without hope of overcoming death is certainly meaningless.\n\nAs animals it isn't logical to think we were 'cursed' with the knowledge of our own future demise. \n\nWe fear death in the same way we fear pain: it motivates us to do something other than bang our heads against the wall. In order to escape the fear of death we seek transcendence; we raise children or create art to effect the next generation. Example: the 'mid-life crises' is caused by 1) getting older 2) feeling you haven't influenced the next generation positively. Some people try to 'make themselves feel younger' via sportscars, drinking, etc. which always fails.\n\nBeing a mere beast is futile."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I believe it is the duty of all citizens eligible for voting to do so, but only as informed citizens. If they are unwilling to become informed, they should not be encouraged to vote. Please note that this does not mean that their right to vote should be infringed, simply that other people should not encourage them to do so.\nFirst Reply:\nIt seems like you're saying two different things here. I agree that the argument that someone should vote purely because it's their patriotic duty is a pretty poor one. \n\nBut people that have little interest in politics shouldn't be discouraged from voting, they should be simultaneously encouraged to vote and to educate themselves about the candidates before doing so. \n\nThere are numerous quizzes online so that even the incredibly lazy can best match their views to a candidate that shares them by answering questions on key issues. There's no reason why someone should be discouraged from voting due to lack of knowledge or interest when the option exists to help them cultivate knowledge or interest.\nSecond Reply:\nI think, as with all views on issues with democracy, that it helps to understand what the purpose of democracy is: It's not to get a good form of government that synthesizes all of the best ideas of all of the people to result in an optimal outcome.\n\nA competent, benevolent dictator can be more or less proven to be a better way to achieve the \"best\" government.

It's to be a check and balance on oppressive and terrible government. That's all. It's pretty terrible at anything else, but luckily that seems to be enough.\n\nPeople should vote whenever they feel that it's important to vote, for whatever reason, because that's how we execute the checks and balances on government that democracy enshrines. \n\nYou can be the stupidest, most ignorant person in the world, but if you're offended by something the government does, and you want to replace it (even with an random choice), then you are serving the purpose of democracy by voting: preventing bad dictators.

Many amendments are written in unusual english by todays standards, making it difficult to tease out meaning. Many other amendments overlap in meaning and could be combined to simplify them while also covering more people. The fact is, it is outdated.\n\nI believe it should be revised every 100 years or so because culture and language are organic. They change based on technology, public conscious, and international relations. Should we follow the advice of a group who believed slavery was acceptable? That thought only white, male, property owners should/could vote? Can you read through the document and understand what was meant or does much of it come across as confusing to todays readers? The world has changed and I believe we need to change with it in order to be relevant. I also believe our ideas and views from today will experience the same degradation over time. In 100 years will the world still care about gun rights? Will the population still speak mostly english or will we add more spanish to our vocabulary? Will words like gay hold the same meaning as it does now or will it return to the usage it once had? We cannot know. We should not force our ideas through time, expecially when future generations will have the same issues understanding us as we do understanding the founding fathers.\n\nWhat I can't understand is why we are clinging to the past, to a group who would likely be viewed as backward racists today. We should take what we believe now and govern by those beliefs. We should update, revise, and examine our core ideas from time to time to at least make sure we still understand what they are. I am not talking about simply throwing the constitution out either. I am saying we should interpret it for today, update it, and use our revised version instead. Then both can be looked at by the next generation and adjusted as needed. It should update and change with the citizenry and the times while still being the timeless core of our laws. It would take a lot of work, a lot would change, but I believe we would be better for it. CMV\n\nMany responses seem to think I am saying scrap the whole thing and start over. No, I am saying we need an updated, reworded one that uses the meanings as we take them today.

Those are examples of what I mean but not the whole of it.\n\nTo CMV you need to show me that having an old, poorly worded document is better than a revision of it in modern terms. It would be hard to do but it would be better for the nation and easier to work with than if we left it be. CMV\n\n(also, deltas incoming for added info on the topic. Hard to delta from a phone)\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nActually, the Constitution is sacrosanct IMO. Amendments are a suitable way of dealing with that level. What I would suggest is a 10 year audit for all legislatures, state and federal, to scrub their books for laws that are antiquated, written for special interests, or otherwise inadequate/poorly conceived. There are plenty of good examples [here](http://www.dumblaws.com/laws/united-states/alabama). I didn't choose Alabama as an example, they're just the first alphabetically. However they have examples that fit my suggestion quite well, I'd say, such as \"It is illegal to sell peanuts in Lee County after sundown on Wednesday,\" \"Dominoes may not be played on Sunday,\" or \"You may not have an ice cream cone in your back pocket at any time.\"\nSecond Reply:\nYou have assertions that it is poorly worded, however your complaint seems to be it's not written in a modern dialect of english.\n\nSo we are going to rewrite it, are we going to use privileged white english, ebonics or spanglish? Maybe we should write it to the english level of a 4th grader? What about the illiterate population, it should be a video-edition because paper is so antiquated.\n\nIf it is unclear in any regard, that can be handled with amendments. Translating it risks losing meaning. You ever play that game where someone whispers something in someones ear and it get's passed in a circle and when it comes back it's a totally new word/phrase?

Womens breasts act in a manner that a evolutionary biologist would call a fitness indicator. If you've ever noticed, all mammals have mammary glands (breasts), but in nearly all cases, the mammary glands are very small until pregnancy happens. Humans are different. Human men evolved to find women with larger breasts more attractive because they tend to be more fertile. This caused sexual selection in favor of larger breasts, which benefitted women with larger breasts, allowing genes for large breasts to spread throughout the population. This is why men are attracted to large breasts, and why women have them.\n\nThen of course, you claim that they are not \"sexual organs.\" The thing is, I don't know what that means. They sure as heck aren't genitals, but they definitely are secondary sex characteristics. A secondary sex characteristic is basically a trait that one gender possesses that the other sex doesn't, yet still doesn't benefit reproduction. For example: arm, body, leg, or facial hair in men, additional muscle in men, breasts in women.\n\nActually, muscle and athletic ability act as a fitness indicator for men in a similar way as breasts do in women, so why do we only sensor women's breasts?\n\nNot trying to argue against you, just bring some extra info to the table :)\nSecond Reply:\nWomen need a certain minimum amount of body fat in order to carry a pregnancy to term and then breastfeed the child. In fact, there is a hormonal regulation mechanism that pauses the menstrual cycle and makes the woman infertile if her body fat falls below a threshold.\n\nIn the environment of adaptation, people were more likely to be malnourished than fat, hence males evolved a sexual preference to avoid investing time and effort to mate with females that looked too skinny, and females evolved to \"advertise\" their body fat by storing it in places where it is most visible in an upright position: the breasts and the buttocks. Co-evolution between male sexual preferences and female body fat distribution created a feedback loop that reinforced these characteristics.\n\nTherefore the vast majority of men are instinctively attracted to large breasts and round firm buttocks. It has nothing to do with \"over sexualization\", it's just biology. (Note that this is different than just being attracted to \"fat\" women, in fact men are generally not attracted to women with an excessive waist-to-hip ratio, which correlates with poor health).\n\nAs for the topless thing, social norms about clothing vary greatly between cultures: In some Islamic countries women often cover head to toe in large burqas, while in some Oceanian tribes people walk around almost naked, women wearing a simple skirt and men wearing only a penis sheath leaving their scrotum exposed.\n\nClearly, Western cultural norms about clothing are somewhere in between. If you want to argue for different norms then you need a stronger argument than just debating the \"sexualization\" of any given body part.\n\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I'll bullet-point for my reasoning:\n\n* More good folks are killed via firearms than are saved by them.  The vast majority of firearm deaths are via suicide, which has an incredibly high success rate compared to all other methods.  Therefore since firearms cause more deaths than they prevent, firearms pose a net-loss for society.\n\n* One major reason we believe we need firearms is the 2nd amendment.  The 2nd amendment is essentially an axiom; in order to have a moral argument as to why we should have guns, I don't think \"because the 2nd amendment says so\" is compelling.  If the 2nd amendment told us to punch babies, that wouldn't make it okay.  Therefore whether or not firearms are truly acceptable must be for a reason outside of this.\n\n* Our logical balance doesn't make sense.  To paraphrase John Oliver, one guy tried to blow up a plane with a shoe and now we all take our shoes off at security.  But so many people shoot up so many schools, and we still haven't done anything substantial about it.  On a similar note, we invest how many trillions of dollars on the war on terror, and yet the amount of Americans killed via guns exceeds the amount killed via terrorism by an extraordinary amount.\n\n* I've read Scalia's opinion in D.C. v. Heller (The most important guns case in modern times).  I don't find the appeal to history compelling.  It seems to me that times have changed so much that arguing what Thomas Jefferson was thinking and then applying it to semi-automatic and automatic weapons just doesn't make sense.  For someone who claims to be a textualist, this appears to me to be a stretch.\n\n* The 2nd amendment and it's current interpretation quashes any possibility of experimentation.  I think part of the American experiment is to allow different states to try different things.  One of the arguments for gun rights is \"what worked for Australia couldn't work for us\".  And yet one only needs to look at Chicago (the city banned some firearms, SCOTUS said that was unacceptable and ruled against Chicago's law) to see that we were never given a chance to figure out what worked.  I would normally suggest an amendment if we wanted to clarify the 2nd amendment for modern times, but it seems to me that nobody will ever be convinced guns are bad (or good!) until we have a concrete application and see whether it works or not.\n\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nFirst of all, in countries that ban firearms you see the gun violence drop, true, but you also see non-gun-related violent crime go up. Outlawing guns will only do one thing: Make it easier for bad guys to kill good guys. In days of prohibition they outlawed alcohol, yet criminals still got it and regular citizens didn't. Certain types of drugs are outlawed yet you still have people getting their hands on them. I think you'll find that even if you ban guns people will still have guns ... except they won't be the good people.\n\nPeople like Penn Jilette and Alex Cross are good when it comes to pointing out why we need guns. Penn points out that in the amendment it says that the right shall not be infringed and that it is the right of the PEOPLE to carry guns as the militia does. It doesn't say it is the right of the militia (cops) to carry a gun, rather it is the right of ordinary citizens, because the people that wrote that document in there were fighting a war against their tyrannical government that had better weapons than them. The gun rights for citizens aren't in there simply to hunt, but to protect yourself.\n\nA guy blew up people with his shoe at an airport, so we take our shoes off there; A guy shot up a school, so now school are gun-free zones and it is illegal to enter a school with a gun ... there you go. We're not going to outlaw all guns simply because they were used to kill children at a school, just like we won't outlaw all shoes because one was used to blow up a plane.\n\nIt's true that there weren't fully automatic weapons in the days our country fought it's war of independence ... but that means no one had those weapons ... The point is to arm yourself just as the government does, so if the government has fully automatic weapons, therefor to best protect yourself you might need one too. However, I disagree that we need fully automatics anyway, you can do a lot more a lot more precise with a semi automatic than you can a fully automatic.\n\nHow's this for convincing? Hitler took guns away from the Jews and only the Jews ... then the Holocaust happened. Millions of Jews murdered by their government ... imagine if they had a even a little pistol to protect themselves, that's millions of guns being fired against the Germans and would have obviously inflicted some heavy casualties on the Nazis to the point WWII might not have happened because Hitler would have been so ruined by the loss of half his army. Stalin took away his peoples guns ... murdered them. Mao took away their guns ... murdered them. Castro ... Pol Pot ... and even today in our lifetime North Korean citizens don't have guns, and their people are being raped and killed by their own military.\nSecond Reply:\nIf you believe in the right to life then you will eventually get to the point of guns being a right too. They are the best way for one to defend oneself, and defend their liberty. Either way there are more defensive uses with a gun than there are offensive uses with a gun. \n\nhttp://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/2013/06/handguns_suicides_mass_shootings_deaths_and_self_defense_findings_from_a.html\n\nYour first point is just untrue.\n\n&gt;Our logical balance doesn't make sense.\n\nWhat John Oliver said doesn't make taking our shoes off right, but just proves why we shouldn't do it anymore. It was done when people were scared, doing the same thing with guns would be just as stupid.\n\n&gt; Thomas Jefferson was thinking and then applying it to semi-automatic and automatic weapons just doesn't make sense.\n\nThey knew semi-auto was a thing, and still wouldn't care. They wanted people to be armed the same way any general military of the time would be.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girandoni_Air_Rifle\n\n&gt;The 2nd amendment and it's current interpretation quashes any possibility of experimentation.\n\nYou shouldn't be able to experiment with removing human rights. Even still DC banned handguns in the 70s and Chicago soon after, and their homicide went up and  didn't drop until decades later when the rest of the countries murder rates began dropping. The fact is those experiments have failed, even Australia's criminologists admit that their gun control did not make them safer from homicide and violent crime.\n\nhttp://www.captainsjournal.com/2012/07/23/do-gun-bans-reduce-violent-crime-ask-the-aussies-and-brits/\n\nhttp://www.ncpa.org/sub/dpd/index.php?Article_ID=17847"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Often, this requires picking a competitor who gets sabotaged.  E.g. \"One of your opponents will give up all their ingredients and have to make their tacos using just what they can recover from this day old salad bar.\"\n\nThis view is about what the best strategy for handing out a sabotage is.  I think that in the first 2 rounds, when you have a choice, you should always target whoever already has a sabotage.  So if someone gave another competitor the salad bar, and then you're handing out who has to give up all utensils for tinfoil, you should always pick the person who got the salad bar.\n\nThe reason is this: you do not win a round of CTK.  You just refrain from losing.  Having the best dish is no better than having the second or third best dish in round one.  You are best off by trying to guarantee one person fails totally.  Because then they go home.\n\nSpreading out the sabotages means its less likely that they'll be crippling (since they're tested to be doable).  If you pile them all on one person though, it becomes much more likely they'll totally fail, thus saving you.\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nWhile I agree that this is usually the best strategy, you have stated it more absolutely than is justified.\n\nFirst: there's an alternate strategy that says you should always target the person who you think would be your (personal) toughest competitor, leaving the weaker opponents to survive. Sometimes this may override the advantage that dogpiling provides. \n\nThat said... it really depends on what the sabotages are. I don't think there can really be any one perfect strategy that doesn't depend on specific situations.\n\nJust to use a contrived example (but one which I have seen occur): One of your opponents forgot to get eggs in a baking challenge. You have a sabotage that removes someone's eggs. Under no circumstances should you give your sabotage to that person, even if they already have 2 sabotages assigned to them. Dogpiling would be the worst possible strategy in that situation.\n\nThere are many similar examples, such of them more subtle, such as someone that has already lost their knives being given a second sabotage that takes away ingredients that need to be cut, and replaces them with precut ingredients of lesser quality. \n\nAlso, much of the time, the \"dogpile\" strategy doesn't really help, because very often the first sabotage equally effects all of your opponents. So at the very least, an *additional* strategy is needed beyond just \"dogpile\". And it's never helpful on the first sabotage.\nSecond Reply:\nI think its best to skip buying sabotages in the first round and save money for the later rounds. I've seen people blow their money too early and have no way to defend themselves in the later rounds. Also you help avoid revenge sabotages, the first round can be such a crap shoot and while the dogpile might ensure one person leaves, you don't know if you've dogpiled a strong chef or a weak chef and wasted money.\n\nNow in the second round I could see this working. If you and the third chef realizes that chef #2 is very strong and adaptable, dogpiling chef #2 would be a solid strategy."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In the comments, a lot of people concluded that this means that in the future, technology will keep creating more jobs than it destroys. **I disagree**. \n\nAt the moment, a five year old kid can beat a computer in a lot of things. For example, having a conversation is very hard for AI. So there are still lots of simple jobs that cannot be done by technology. \n\nAs long as our civilization does not collapse, technology and AI will keep getting better. In the near future, self-driving cars will replace a lot of jobs. This kind of stuff will keep happening until mechanical brains outperform human brains, at a similar or lower cost. When that happens, human labor will become as redundant as horse labor. **Change my view!**\n\n**[Obligatory \"Humans Need Not Apply link\"](https://youtu.be/7Pq-S557XQU?t=3m31s)**\nFirst Reply:\nI agree that most unskilled labor jobs will be made redundant. But it won't be as bad as most people think, here's why:\n\nAlmost everyone forgets about competition. There will be multiple companies in the future automating food production / delivery / sales. These companies will compete on price. As they both save costs by automating they will lower their prices (if you don't lower your prices no one will shop with you and you'll go out of business). Eventually this will drive the cost of food to almost zero. \n\nSimilar events will unfold in housing, clothing and other markets. \n\nOnce this happens it will be fairly easy for people to have their basic needs met at almost zero cost and the government will provide this for them (else they'll be riots, that's what happens when people get hungry). \n\nNow skilled labor in research and technology won't go away for a long, long time (at least until they invent real AI). There is literally infinite technology we can invent and create and almost infinite medical problems to solve. We could have all 7 billion people in the world working in technology and medicine and we still wouldn't have anywhere near enough. For anyone that wants to work and puts in the effort to get into these fields there will be an endless supply of things to do. \nSecond Reply:\nI actually agree with you, but there's a couple of things that I think might be able to prevent this for occurring.\n\nNanobot implants inserted into the brain could help cure degenerative diseases in the future. Beyond that, they could go on to boost human capabilities to machine like levels.\n\nIt's possible that humans may be able to compete with machines for jobs in the future because of this. It wouldn't be an ideal scenario, but it would maintain the status quo. That could be a dangerously powerful effect. A structure that forces people into strengthening that structure could persist long after it has become redundant. \n\n\nThe other thing is a bit simpler. The dream is that machines do all the work while humans live a life of leisure, right? But, maybe a life of leisure wouldn't be all that enjoyable. Human desire to build something for themselves or be remembered could keep people working. Maybe not in a way that you'd call \"labour\" but on personal and collaborative projects or works that they share with others."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Here's the deal, say you live in a world where it is impossible to do anything morally wrong. Then in that world there would be no reason to praise or reward someone for doing the moral thing because there is no other option. Likewise, there is no one who could possibly be punished (like sending them to hell for instance). Clearly we do not live in such a world, but religious individuals/groups who insist that something should be illegal or made nearly impossible due to religious views are trying to make our world more like the one in the scenario I suggested above where it is impossible to do anything morally wrong. Thus, forcing people to comply with the rules of your religion actually seem to make the rules less meaningful which seems like something that religious individuals would want to avoid.\n\nNote, I'm only talking about things where the main reason for believing them is religion - like beliefs about gay marriage, premarital sex, drinking alcohol, etc. Therefore, things like the belief that you should not murder people would not count as having a primarily religious nature because most people also find murder horrific in a separate sense from religion.\n\nTo phrase it differently, if all alcohol disappeared from earth tomorrow and humans somehow could no longer make it, would abstaining from drinking alcohol mean anything? I don't think so.\n\nWithout having the choice to do the 'wrong' thing, then doing the 'right' thing is meaningless.\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nI am not entirely sure what view you are attempting to have changed here. Either \"my religion states that drinking is wrong so for that reason I am fighting to make alcohol illegal\" is what you take issue with, or \"my religion states drinking is wrong, and it is more virtuous to abstain from drinking when temptation is all around you than to abstain when abstinence has been made the default legal option\".\n\nThe first one which is often tied to another topic which I don't want to start a debate about, could be construed in a few different ways. If drinking is such a reprehensible act and the ills it causes society are immeasurably horrific according to your religion, then doing everything in your power to prevent it from happening (in this case enacting legislation) could be considered moral and desirable. Further, if there are people who do not subscribe to your religion that take part in such a sinful exercise, while you may not be converting them to your religion (which is often the ultimate goal) you are at least preventing them from doing something that you view as wrong. \n\nLet's say we did live in a world where murder really was perfectly acceptable, but religion decided it isn't as great as everyone else thinks it is. If religion cannot convert everyone to that religion and their beliefs, would it not be at least a partial win for them to use \"secular\" powers for them to prevent murder? Would it not be dutiful/righteous of you and your religion to try to prevent everyone else from doing things you believe to be wrong?\n\nFor the second \"without temptation, abstinence is meaningless\" argument, people who have a religious conviction to avoid something typically put a great deal of effort into avoiding situations where they would encounter temptation. While alcohol may be freely available in some parts of the world, most people who have made a religious decision to avoid it do not keep it in the house to test their temptation. In largely religious communities/jurisdictions, it might not be commercially available, or at least you have to go out of your way to find it. They probably don't find themselves at craft beer festivals, taking winery tours, going to dollar pint night etc. all that frequently either. So while they might not be fighting for prohibition to be reenacted, they aren't actively seeking out alcohol in order to not drink it, and I doubt it would be considered good or righteous for them to be doing so. \n\nAre you suggesting that \"true believers\" would/should be testing their beliefs by regularly encountering temptation? Is that the best way to prove your faith?\n\nPersonally, I believe that if someone has a religious conviction against something then they are welcomed to believe that, but they should be accepting that others do not share their faith and thus their beliefs. That concept runs completely against most religions, as they tend to have some sort of \"share the good word\" or \"make others believe\" clause in there somewhere, but whether or not religion is a good or bad thing is not the topic of this CMV. \nSecond Reply:\nSeems to me that your position is built on the assumption that the religious view is factually incorrect, no? That seems to be the key issue here.\n\nLet's say, for example, that I have a religious belief that if you have gay sex, it will cause a drought. And therefore I think we should ban gay sex.\n\nWhat's really the important issue here. That my position is motivated by religion? Or that my position was factually inaccurate? To me, as an atheist, I actually don't care what the motivation for your belief is, whether it be religious or secular. I care about 2 things, in a very very simplified model:\n\n1) Do I agree with the goal you are trying to achieve?\n\n2) If so, do I agree that the means you advocate achieves that goal?\n\nTaking the example above, I do agree that drought is bad. So we've passed step 1. But I don't agree that banning gay sex will alleviate the drought. Whether or not your belief that doing so comes from religious or secular just doesn't seem relevant.\n\nMake sense?"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The spirit of this law is that the vote should be your own, informed choice, rather than letting someone else make the decision for you.\n\n\nPoint 1 - http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-verification-without-id-documents.aspx\nThe ncsl site details some terribly inefficient and time consuming ways to verify someone's identity without an ID. Time needs to be used to look up data and then more time needs to be spent comparing data. And then more time after that when things dont match up and you have to fix / argue your want through.\n\nPoint 2 - I have trouble understanding the argument about how requiring IDs to vote is discriminatory in a bad way. The argument is that requiring an ID would discourage poor people from voting. Even the poorest citizens engage smoking and drinking, which are activities that they probably have been asked for an ID for. I find it inconceivable that someone without an ID would be someone capable of making an informed vote. If you couldn't find the time out of all the years in your life and maybe 10 dollars to get an ID, then I believe that you are the exact type of irresponsible person who should not be voting at all.\n\nPoint 3 - There are long lines at voting and requiring IDs would cut it down. The government requires employers to pay workers while they take off to go vote. I can think of many employers who will tell you to take the whole day off rather than pay you a full day for half a day's work. This is a partially broken law which only works for full time employees. Part time employees, which generally make less money, often cannot take advantage of this. I'd make the argument that by not requiring ID's to vote, they are discriminating against people whose time is more valuable than voting. I believe the best way to encourage voting is to make voting easier and less time consuming. \n\nPoint 4 - Perhaps instead of trying to tackle enormously expensive projects like free healthcare and free college, we can start with the easy and low cost / high benefit ones like free ID cards.\nFirst Reply:\nAt the moment, in most states, the requirement to vote is to fill out a card asserting you are eligible.  It is up to the state to show that you are not eligible.  The burden of proof is on the state to prove whether you are or are not eligible.\n\nWith a mandatory voter ID, you've moved the burden of proof onto the citizen to prove that they are eligible to vote.  They have to have proof of a birth certificate, social security card, utility bill, or some other form of proof.  With elderly or poor people, they may not have these documents available, and voter ID has passed the burden of proof onto the voter.\n\nHaving or not having an ID doesn't make a significant difference in voting lines.  At least in my experience, the bottleneck is almost always the booths themselves, not the sign-in portion.  If you want to make voting more accessible, move to a 24 hour voting period.  I think that would be even better than declaring voting day a holiday - if you run elections from 7 PM to 7 PM or whatever, then even part-time workers with multiple jobs should have some time to vote.\nSecond Reply:\nYou have a major unrecognized assumption. You assume that it is as easy as going down to some place and paying $10 to get an ID. If you do not have an address (that is, very poor) it is essentially impossible to get an ID. If you don't have a birth certificate, which is more likely if you are poor, (not born in a hospital, parents didn't keep good track of it, house burned down, got robbed, etc,) it is very difficult to get one, and essentially impossible to get any other ID until you do. \n\nThese same factors are also one of the huge obstacles to escaping poverty. I have always wanted someone to film an experiment where they pretend their ID, cell phone and home don't exist, and try to get government assistance or a permanent job, because it seems largely impossible."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

If Republicans start losing big-time, the platforms of its candidates will shift.\n\nBut Republicans *are* winning elections. Republicans hold the House (by a wide margin) and the Senate.  There are way more Republican governors than Democrats. \n\nAdditionally, how people vote in election depends on a lot more than the views the candidates hold.  The overall assessment of how the country is doing, especially its economy, is a huge factor.  If everything is going well, incumbents (and the incumbent party) get a boost.  If not, incumbents (and the incumbent party) are hurt.  You can see this with the House and Senate.  During and shortly after the end of the unpopular Bush presidency, the House and Senate were solidly Democrat.  But as the economy continued to slump under Obama, they've both gone back to solidly Republican.  People's opinions didn't drastically change in that time.  It's more that the overall political climate shifted.\nSecond Reply:\nThe flaw in your thinking is that people don't change their beliefs over time.  You know all of those \"old Conservatives\" that are starting to die off?  They were bra-burning, free-loving, pot-smoking hippies in the 1960s.  They were \"young liberals.\"  \n\nIt isn't that conservatism was popular in 50 years ago and now it's been replaced with liberalism.  It's that people tend to be liberal when they're young and *become* more conservative over time.  \n\nAlso, please don't confuse Conservative with Republican.  These are very different things."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

We already have it! It\u2019s the trains! If public transport such as railways are expanded and given priority over road vehicles in infrastructure, then we can achieve the goals that the automotive industry is trying to achieve very quickly.\n\nWe should divert the resources that we spend on making smarter cars (finances and human capital) to making smarter, faster, safer, public transport and expand the rail network. If we just expand the rail network then people will automatically shift from driving a car to riding on a train as their preferred choice of daily commute.\n\nSome of the points I have against road transport for individuals.\n\n\n\u2022\tEnvironmental impact- A vast majority of cars are running on fuels that emit pollutants in the environment.\n\n\n\u2022\tSafety- Road injury was one of the top 10 causes of death in the world. According to WHO, road injury took lives of 1.3 Million people in the last decade.\n\n\n\u2022\tStress\u2013 While driving for enjoyment is really fun on your off days, daily commute hardly is. We are spending a nice chunk of our day that we can spend relaxing, reading or working to complete the last minute project on a rather stressful, and repetitive driving route facing traffic jams and asshole drivers.\n\n\n\u2022\tEnergy efficiency \u2013 A car owner takes a Ton of metal with him just to get from point A to B. Fuel efficiency of trains is superior to that of cars.\n\n\n\u2022\tMaintenance \u2013 a car requires frequent upkeep and maintenance of its parts and components.\n\n\n\u2022\tEconomy \u2013 Transportation is lot more expensive in cars.\nHere are some points that I have for expansion of public transport.\n\n\n\u2022\tBonus free time \u2013 When I\u2019m in a train I can browse my phone, read a news paper work on my presentation without the fear of killing someone. This is something driverless cars are trying to achieve and are still years away from it.\n\n\n\u2022\tPotty Breaks \u2013 trains can be modified to have them, cars don\u2019t. I\u2019d have to pause my driving, find a gas station and then resume it again, why do that when you can go on the go.\n\n\n\u2022\tFuel Efficiency.\n\n\n\u2022\tNoise reduction.\n\n\n\u2022\tSkill Transfer- People who graduate in engineering and were thinking of joining an automotive manufacturer can just as easily join a locomotive manufacturer.\n\n\nI am not arguing for an absolute ban on using cars, I just think if we focus on public transport more than we would solve a lot of problems that automotive market is trying to eliminate. Problems such as energy efficiency, pollution, and vehicle automation can be achieved with technology that we have **today.** \n\n\nFirst Reply:\nI will be addressing this situation in the US, where public transit is generally not highly regarded and there is vast infrastructure for personal vehicles. I will also try to avoid cultural biases.\nI agree with your sentiment, However I don't view the two as alternatives to one another, nor is either one a complete solution to all transportation problems.\nmost major US cities would benefit from better and cleaner public transportation. This is held back in large part by the fact that the US is heavily invested in the massive personal transport infrastructure it already has, and attempts to reform the entire system could be very disruptive to public life.\nThere are also inherent limitations to public transportation. Traditional mass transit is not a good model for the widely-spaced, diffuse populations in a lot of the middle of the country. It is also an imperfect solution for people with disabilities: a member of my family is unable to drive due to visual impairment, and cannot walk very well due to partial paralysis in the leg. Even if suburban public transit provided a direct route from our town to where she works, it would be very difficult for her to make It to and from the station. A self driving vehicle could allow for a greater degree of mobility and autonomy for handicapped people.\nSecond Reply:\nOne major point that I think you need to consider is personal preference.  Like it or not, most people prefer the freedom to leave when exactly when they want, directly from their current location, and directly to their destination.  These are things that public transportation requires compromises on, often quite significant compromises in the type of environment that most Americans live in.\n\nWith that in mind, even if you were somehow able to fund and construct the *perfect* public transportation system, I don't think you'd get anywhere near 100% adoption by the public.\n\nI live in a fairly public transportation \"friendly\" city, by most standards, and while our system is far from perfect, it is fairly extensive.  I find it personally more pleasant to take the bus when going downtown, rather than dealing with traffic.\n\nBy the way, while we have a relatively good public transit system, we have a really poor infrastructure for driving.  Everyone here complains about the traffic, and it's only continuing to get worse.  I only point this out to say that my city is probably close to a best case scenario for giving people incentive to use public transit.\n\nHowever, most people here don't make that same calculation.  Either the slight time loss waiting for the bus on both legs of a journey, or the time lost stopping to pick up passengers, or the inconvenience of buying tickets, or the loss of freedom, or something else causes most people around here to continue to drive.\n\nIf a relatively good public transit system loses out in peoples minds to a relatively poor private vehicle system, then I don't think our time is best spent making a good public transit system marginally better.\n\nThere's a parallel argument that might make this point better.  A lot of people choose to drive large trucks or SUVs either because they use the hauling capacity for work or leisure, or honestly, sometimes just because they want to.  Some environmental activists would prefer we oppose trucks at all costs, pushing everyone towards smaller and more efficient vehicles, even hybrids if we can.\n\nThe problem with that is that we've had limited success so far.  Trucks are still a hugely disproportionate part of the total auto sales in the US.\n\nWith that in mind, is it still worth the effort and trouble to continue to fight against human nature and the incentives that push people into buying trucks, or is it better to limit the impact of the trucks that are going to be sold anyway?\n\nWe've finally started to do the latter, with new trucks starting to come out with much more fuel efficient engines, lighter construction, and better aerodynamics.  It's to the point that some full size trucks are talking about getting 30 mpg in the near future, which is better than my small hatchback.\n\nI see your argument as something similar.  In ideal world, no one would buy a truck unless they actually truly *needed* it.  In an ideal world, everyone would take advantage of a perfect public transit system should we provide one.\n\nIn the real world, people just want what they want for a variety of complicated reasons.  Ignoring that leads to solutions for ideal world problems which totally fail to do anything for real world problems.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

That has set a precedent where it would be legally acceptable to issue fines to other violations without human input.\n\nIf a driver passes through toll A, then passes through toll B (10 miles away) after 5 minutes, it's possible to determine the driver's minimum speed as 120 mph. It's possible the driver went faster then paused before they crossed toll B, but it would not be possible for them to have traveled at a legal speed and still pass through toll B within that time.\n\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nDepending on the laws of a particular state, this might or might not be legal. \n\nCalifornia specifically prohibits even police officers, much less automated systems, from operating a \"speed trap\", which is defined as measuring the time it takes someone to travel between 2 fixed locations to infer their speed (and also using radar without a proper engineering study of the road showing the maximum safe speed thereupon, and a few other things). \n\nWhile this is intended to avoid the corruption and human error and bias that such measurements have always been prone to, it would still prohibit the use you're speaking of. \n\nThere's no law on the books that says you can't be ticketed for being observed running a red light, though.\nSecond Reply:\nA red light camera can not issue a citation for a moving violation. \n\nIt can only issue a fine that breaks a rule against city code.\n\nLike many other cities, Fort Worth has red light cameras, but you can't be compelled to pay them. No one pays them around here because it's toothless because the courts decided that only a live officer can issue a citation for a moving violation. \n\nBasically, as the law sees it, any automated system can not and does not have the jurisdiction to ticket anyone for anything. That is only reserved for police officers and troopers."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

My general logic is if you HAVE to sign someone up to vote, they will most likely be too lazy to take the time to read up on their candidates or what they're voting for.  I believe everybody should have the right to vote and access to voting, but when you're cajoling people into registering you're adding fluff votes based on color, party, or sensationalized issues.\nI feel like most people I've brought this up with believe I'm wrong so I just want a well constructed argument as to why.  Not here to argue at all, thanks for your time!\n\nFirst Reply:\nRegistering someone doesn't \"make\" them go to the polls and vote, it merely preserves that ability to do so if they find that they want to at the last minute.\n\nAnd that's a valuable purpose. The main purpose of democracy is not to represent all the views of all the people all the time, it's to act as a check and balance on oppression and extremely bad government. \n\nThis goal is frustrated any time there are artificial barriers in the way of people voting when they feel the need/desire to do so. Registration is exactly that kind of arbitrary artificial barrier.\n\nAs such, it tends to frustrate the actual primary purpose of democracy: people being able to object when the government does things they don't like. \nSecond Reply:\nFor a lot of the people I've asked why they don't vote, they give one of two main answers \"I don't know how/I don't have the time!\" or \"Why should politics matter to me? It's not like it affects my life.\"\n\nThe first one is easy to solve, there are people with political motives who will help you sign up, you can get registered at the DMV, you can print out the form and mail it in! It is not that hard!\n\nAnd as to the second one... most people don't like to talk about \"politics\". They don't care about what some snootty politician said to another in some long winded debate, or the fine print of some bill that just went to be voted into law. However, ask them about individual issues and they'll have plenty to say. Gay marriage, police brutality, privacy, tax laws, discrimination laws, education, pollution, etc... Helping people understand the channels they have to engage with the issues they feel strongly about and affiliate with the political parties and leaders who support their arguments is very important.

My problem is that everyone seems to agree that self harm is bad, but no one can give me a logical argument for why.\n\nSo far this is the logic I've heard again and again:\nSelf harm is bad because it is dangerous. It is dangerous because you could die, or could get an infection.\n\nThe problem I have seen with this is that you can replace \"self harm\" with so many other things and still follow the same basic structure.\n\nLacrosse is bad because it is dangerous. It is dangerous because you could get a concussion.\n\nCooking is bad because it is dangerous. You could get burned.\n\nTaking Lithium for Bipolar Disorder is bad because it is dangerous.  It is dangerous because it could give you kidney failure.\n\nSo I can not accept the false-logic of dangerous = bad. That means anything dangerous is inherently bad, and that is not true.\n\nIt is very easy to self harm without any danger.  Sterilize tools, clean and cover wounds, etcetera.\n\nOf course this can still leave permanent scars, but so can getting a tattoo or a piercing, so once again, self harm isn't inherently bad just because it leaves scars.  Lots of things leave scars, so scars aren't what's bad about it.\n\nOkay, but it's a symptom of a bigger problem.  Yes.  And the bigger problem is the thing that should be fixed.  But that *still* doesn't mean that the symptom is bad.\n\nIf you have a bacterial infection, you treat the infection.  You don't just cover any redness up with makeup to treat the symptom.  So self harm, the symptom of many mood disorders, isn't what should be treated.\n\nSo besides the ridiculously flawed \"it's dangerous\" argument, explain to me why self harm is inherently bad.\n\nTl;Dr, something being dangerous doesn't make it bad. Give me a real reason why self harm is bad.\n\n\n\nFirst Reply:\n&gt;The problem I have seen with this is that you can replace \"self harm\" with so many other things and still follow the same basic structure.\n&gt;Lacrosse is bad because it is dangerous.

It \nis dangerous because it could give you kidney failure.\n\n&gt;So I can not accept the false-logic of dangerous = bad. That means \nanything dangerous is inherently bad, and that is not true.\n\n\nThese points all do not quite fit the definition of harmful = bad. In all these situations, the activity is done where a risk of harm is present, but the practitioners try to avoid harm.\n\n\nSelf harm is more like an addiction, such as drug abuse or alcohol abuse. Where it is done as a coping mechanism to cover deeper rooted problems within a person, and can quickly become addictive to the point where a person cannot stop themselves from doing in.\n\n\nEven then, the pain and damage caused by drugs is an unintended consequence. The comedown, the shakes, the liver damage, the collapsed veins and ruined skin.  No body takes methamphetamines because they want to damage their body with them\n\n\nSelf harm is literally your damaging your body, for the sake of damaging your body. Arguably, it is the mental health equivalent of an auto immune disorder, where something has gone wrong and your body damages healthy tissue.\nSecond Reply:\nIt's not bad because it's dangerous, it's bad because it is the deliberate infliction of direct harm on yourself, and that goes directly against *normal* biological impulse.\n\nI'd say that because we have evolved to want to *avoid* harm: healthy functioning humans avoid harm; they even avoid the *risk* of harm where that risk is significant.\n\nAn individual who transgresses this instinct of avoiding harm is seen as unhealthy, and the act viewed as morally undesirable.\n\n&gt; It is very easy to self harm without any danger. Sterilize tools, clean and cover wounds, etcetera.\n\nThis may be true today, but for our entire evolutionary history this was absolutely false. Any and all wounds carried *significant* risk, so we have, as a species and in general, developed an instinctual response to avoid them.\n\nIf someone demonstrates that they *lack* that preventitive instinct by cutting themselves there's an immediate cause for moral concern because so much of our socially acceptable behaviour (ie: morality) is tied up in biological instincts: the rational desire to live, empathy, and so on.\n\nSelf-harming, even if it effects no one else, *does* call into question someone's mental state and fitness to act in a pro-social way, so I think it's fine for us to want to discourage that kind of behaviour and label it 'bad'."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It feels really fulfilling to me to make something (a bot) that does what a person couldn't do in a month's full time work.

The fact that you understand just how powerful the tools are becoming to gather and analyze data on such a massive scale should give you a pause. Yes, if used for good, it can improve a lot of stuff. But just like any super powerful thing, if used badly it can cause shitloads of damage.\n\nThe same bots and analytical tools for determining something in marketing can and most importantly ARE being used for nefarious purposes - like discovering and stopping political dissent for example. You should never trust that your government will always do good. Take a look at any history book of any country (including yours). What you will find is that again and again governments are doing shitty things and abusing their power.\n\nYou are trusting the same institution that tried to get MLK to kill himself by threatening they will expose his affairs. For what? Because he wanted rights for black people. Well, what happens when when the new MLK is born tomorrow and the government has all these powerful tools to gather all the dirt they want on them, to figure out who the supporters are and so on?\n\nLet's assume the government at the moment is not like that and are honestly doing only good with the info (which as revealed by whistleblowers is not true, but lets entertain the thought). Can you then guarantee all future governments will be so good too? Because once you give your government such powers, it's very hard to take them back. So what happens a decade or two down the line, when a bunch of assholes are in power?\n\nTo support this you need not only believe the current government do not abuse the power (which is a bit naive) but that future governments will not abuse the powers either (which is quite frankly nearly impossible).\n\nAnd for what? The number of people dying in terrorist plots is minuscule, even in 3rd world countries. If you want to save human lives at the cost of freedom so much, you'll be better off attacking the big problems, like obesity for example.\nSecond Reply:\n&gt; if the data they collect and use helps their ability to govern then I am all for it\n\nIf one could be certain that this is *solely* how the data would be used, then yes, I'd be in favor it it too, but that isn't how power works.  At least, that's not how it's ever worked throughout human history ... maybe this time will be different?  Right.\n\nIt is also arguably illegal.  So even if we wanted to do this, we'd potentially have to amend the constitution to grant the government this power.\n\nAside from abuse, there's also the fact that these data storage systems cannot be secured.  Note the recent hack of data regarding everyone that's ever had a security clearance background check.\n\nWhile I have not been directly investigated for security clearance, my name is in at least 4 security clearance files as a 'relation' some some kind.  I'm not really happy about that now, and have no confidence that the government's ability to execute such surveillance securely is competent.\n\n&gt;  I'm just glad someone is using my information to make my life and the lives of others to be better.\n\nThis is very specifically the job of the Census folks, not the NSA, and plenty of people don't even trust them either."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I think all real property taxes should be assessed based solely on the fair market value of the property.  It should not matter what the use of the property is, or who lives there.  If you own a plot with a value of $300,000, you should pay the same tax as any other owner of a plot valued at $300,000.\n\nThe most egregious example against this to me is [California prop 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_13_\\(1978\\)) which freezes property taxes when you buy a house, essentially subsidizing long-term residents at the cost of more recent arrivals.\n\nThe basic reasoning for this is twofold.  First, there's a fairness question, since the taxes you pay should be the same no matter who you are.

In the case of property taxes, they're already progressive in as much as they depend on the fair market value of an asset you own.\n\nThat's not progressive, though.  That's just linear.  Progressive would mean the amount of tax owed increases proportionately faster than the value of the property.  \"Fairness\" is a hard concept to nail down - you probably wouldn't consider a linear income tax to be fair.\n\n&gt; Second is an efficiency issue.

In my opinion \"not seeing color\" IS the attitude we should cultivate.\nIn this post I am going to be very blunt. This is because I want to show exactly how all this impacted the thinking of myself and the people around me. I was born here in the US but I am of Chinese and Thai descent. As a child I grew up not really caring at all about race, I just sort of assumed humans came is all different colors and shapes and that was normal. I didn't even know there were names for the different races and ethnicities. The only thing I was really aware of was if people actually came from a different country.\n\nAs I grew older, my classmates and I were bombarded with racial messages during school and everywhere else. We were taught that white people were somehow inherently racist. We were taught that everyone else was perfect and every bad thing they did throughout history was somehow righteous and justified. I started to see lines forming. White kids were told that they were somehow responsible for everything some people in the past did. Black kids were taught that they were owed something. I noticed kids start self-segregating. It wasn't anything dramatic, no one attributed this to the things we were being taught, but people knew they were different now. \n\nI grew older still. I started paying attention to the news and the internet,. Race was discussed alot. I learned about affirmative action and it made my blood boil. If you didn't know, Asians are hurt the most by affirmative action. I would need a MUCH higher SAT score and GPA than a black person to get into the schools of my choice. I started to resent black people for this. Why was I being hurt because an entire race was apparently performing poorly and my entire race wasn't? And if discrimination was the reason, well my race was discriminated against in the past too! This was opinion shared by my friends. It led us to think that if this was the case, black people didn't try very much and were lazy in school. Otherwise why would they need help? I was infuriated to learn that a black girl who took all level classes and wasn't even close to the top of the class was accepted into my first choice college while I was not, despite my excellent grades and test scores. When I went to college, I made sure to avoid going to black doctors and other black professionals for fear than they got their position due to unfair preferences.\n\nI learned about the black crime rate, and prison population. I started to become scared when I saw a black person on the streets. All the commentary about how this was racist merely solidified my opinion. I saw how violent black neighborhoods are, I was catcalled constantly by black men in the streets, I worked in a leasing office and saw black tenants who lived entirely off the government and complained about everything. If I hadn't heard about race my entire life I would have written all these off as \"Man those specific people suck\" rather than lump the entire race together. People address these issues as if everyone else is to blame for these peoples actions, instead of saying hey, those are just bad people. Instead they make it a race thing where those bad people are actually VICTIMS. I heard about the police shootings and the publicity around them. I heard about the riots, and the more people talked about how the senseless destruction was justified the more I distanced myself and the more scared I became. I started to involuntarily see black people as a threat. My friends all secretly talked about how they wished all these people would go back to Africa so we could all live in peace. In the past couple years after all the discussion about race I have seen SOO many non-black people become essentially racist, and so many wonderful black people become entitled and vitriolic.\n\nSo basically, I feel like if we brought our kids up to not see color and talk about Americans as Americans, rather than african-american, asian american, etc, racism would soon become a thing of the past. If we keep bringing up race in EVERYTHING, kids start drawing lines and lumping people together as their race, rather than as Americans. They start noticing and being hyper-aware of differences between races. Crying racism in every situation just annoys people and defeats the goal of ending racism. Racial and diversity programs make people resentful, and make the benefitting parties feel entitled. People should be chosen on merit alone. \"Not seeing color\" is treated as ignorant and is laughed at, but I feel that this is the best way to operate if we are ever going to solve our problems.\n\nI'd like other opinions on this because the way I see the world right now truly sickens me. I don't want to keep feeling like I am different because I am Asian, I want to feel American and be okay with the way people talk about race. I want to feel okay with the way we as Americans are dealing with these issues. I also want to understand why \"not seeing color\" is ridiculed.\nFirst Reply:\nMost people who have some privilege (whether that be class, race, gender ect.) grow up in a bubble to some degree or another. We think that the world is in basically good shape, and that since we don't have obvious problems like Jim Crow or men stoning their wives, social justice has basically prevailed to the most reasonable extent.\n\nIf you're a women, it doesn't take long for that bubble to be popped. You will probably feel that you're systematically treated differently from men, and in many cases, treated worse. If you're black, you'll probably feel that you're treated differently than other races, often times much worst. If you're poor, -and so on. In your case, it was obvious that that asians are treated differently than other people. It's a cruel perversion of reasoning when the stereotype that \"asians are smart\" is used to disenfranchise them.\n\nThese bubbles don't pop all at once though, what if your on the other end of one of the many inequalities society presents? What if you happen to be middle class, or white, or cis or male? A lot of times it's the same thing. We come out of childhood and realise that \"Oh shit, society is still kinda fucked. We should probably do something about this.\" And, that's uncomfortable, but kind of necessary.\n\nOur default reaction to questioning the way we live is usually, anger, annoyance, or disbelief. We don't want to think about fact that the lifestyle we've been living all our lives *might* be contributing to massive social harm. We're scared of being a bad person. Which is understandable. In the bubble, we believe we're a good normal person.\n\nYou can be a good person outside of the bubble. Even if you're going to involuntarily profit off of some parts of a broken system for the rest of your life, you can still define yourself by your actions and not the circumstances of your birth. But that takes some seriously uncomfortable internal debate. You have to seriously think about what is not okay in the world, and what you're going to do about it. It's a lot easier to say fuck you to who ever brought all this up and stay in your bubble.\n\nExample, few people like to think about whether eating meat is wrong. We just say, meat is NORMAL, why are we even TALKING ABOUT THIS? It's not like it's impossible to have a debate about whether eating animals is okay, and still come out of that thinking meat is fine to eat, or at least, that you're not necessarily a bad person for doing so. But we'd rather not even entertain the possibility.\n\nSo if we all stay in our bubbles and indeed school our children to do so, is institutionalized racism against asians ever really going to end? If we can't even debate whether or not things like racism exist in the world, how can we hope to be on the right side of it?\n\nIf this reasoning helped at all, it's mostly paraphrased from [Why Are You So Angry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExEHuNrC8yU). The video is a lot more eloquent than I am.\n\nAs one last note on the topic of affirmative action, and reverse racism generally. It's possible for a black privilege and a white privilege to exist simultaneously. That doesn't somehow mean the scales are balanced. It just means the world is complicated and there's even more to consider now.\nSecond Reply:\nWhile disappointing, I cannot say your view is unique here on reddit or anywhere else in the country, so I'm glad you're here on CMV.\n\n&gt; &gt; As I grew older, my classmates and I were bombarded with racial messages during school and everywhere else. We were taught that white people were somehow inherently racist. We were taught that everyone else was perfect and every bad thing they did throughout history was somehow righteous and justified. I started to see lines forming. White kids were told that they were somehow responsible for everything some people in the past did. Black kids were taught that they were owed something. I noticed kids start self-segregating. It wasn't anything dramatic, no one attributed this to the things we were being taught, but people knew they were different now.\n&gt; &gt; \n\nCould you provide examples of this? As someone who is black, I was never taught that I was \"owed\" anything. I was also never taught that all white people are responsible for the hideous injustices of the past.\n\n&gt; I grew older still. I started paying attention to the news and the internet,. Race was discussed alot. I learned about affirmative action and it made my blood boil. If you didn't know, Asians are hurt the most by affirmative action. I would need a MUCH higher SAT score and GPA than a black person to get into the schools of my choice. I started to resent black people for this. Why was I being hurt because an entire race was apparently performing poorly and my entire race wasn't?\n\nWhile I am not a supporter of AA, it is often a misunderstood policy.\n\nPretend you have 2 little league football coaches:\n\nCoach 1 takes over a team that was 2-12, and at the end of the season has a score of 8-6\n\nCoach 2 takes over a team that was 7-7, and at the end of the season that is 10-4\n\nI want to hire the most qualified coach. If I just look at what their current seasons were, I would have to go with Coach 2. Coach 2 clearly has a superior record to Coach 1. However, is Coach 2 really more qualified? \n\nCoach 1 obviously had to begin with a *much* worse team than Coach 2. If I honestly want the best coach, it would be foolish not to take that into account.\n\nThe idea behind AA is that we take into account peoples starting positions. This is where the confusion is. If an average white kid gets a score of 1980 on the SAT, and an average black kid gets a score of 1800, the argument isn't that the less qualified black person should get the spot. The argument is that the black student ***is*** the more qualified student. The idea is that we can't just look at the test scores in a vacuum, and that if the black student was raised in the same circumstance, they would have scored much higher.\n\nThe reason to not support AA isn't because it hurts the students getting passed over, but because it often hurts the students being let in. Even if we concede that a black kid being raised by a single mom working 2 jobs is at a supreme disadvantage, if we let that kid into an advanced school, it still doesn't change the fact that they don't have the skillset to be able to perform in that environment. Being a good student is learned behavior, and it is very unlikely this kid was taught how to be a good student. They simply won't be able to perform, no matter how smart they are, due to their upbringing.\n\n\n&gt; And if discrimination was the reason, well my race was discriminated against in the past too! This was opinion shared by my friends. It led us to think that if this was the case, black people didn't try very much and were lazy in school. Otherwise why would they need help? I was infuriated to learn that a black girl who took all level classes and wasn't even close to the top of the class was accepted into my first choice college while I was not, despite my excellent grades and test scores. When I went to college, I made sure to avoid going to black doctors and other black professionals for fear than they got their position due to unfair preferences.\n\nAsians certainly delt with discrimination in the US. However, the discrimination faced was far less severe and couldn't have as large an effect on their population. This is due to most Asian Americans voluntarily coming here, meaning you have a *very* significant selection factor going on. To put it bluntly, most asians already came here with marketable skills(otherwise they would never have made it here). When you have marketable skills, discrimination is far less effective a means to harm people. Here is a good video explaining this:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Eu_bKJ11O0M?t=3m23s\n\n\nIf you no longer want to go to black professionals because of this, that's your business. But I feel the need to remind you that getting into the college doesn't net you a degree. You still need to pass the classes and graduate, and black students don't get AA while professors are grading their exams.\n\n&gt; I learned about the black crime rate, and prison population. I started to become scared when I saw a black person on the streets.\n\nYou need to be careful with how you interpret statistics. The reason that most people will charge people who cite these statistics racist is because they are usually trying to cite them to present a narrative of the black thug, and do very little to interpret any statistic honestly. Here is a related example.\n\nImagine you have a small asian town in California that kidnaps people that pass by and cannibalizes them. They do this for an entire year, kidnapping around 50 people.\n\nWhen they're caught, and then convicted of this heinous act, later that year I release a headline:\n\n**98% of all cannibalism cases committed by asians**.\n\nThis would be a true statement statistically. Since cannibalism is a very rare crime, this town would responsible for almost 100 percent of the cannibalism cases. However, this is disingenuous to say the least. Me presenting the headline in that manner suggests that asians everywhere are to be feared. Seeing an asian in Vermont might cause people to be cautious that that person would eat them. By printing it I would *knowingly* be spreading misinformation, while technically not telling a single lie.\n\nAs for the black crime rate, most of it is concentrated in very specific high crime areas. You could look at the murder rate the same way we looked at cannibalism. It is, when dealing with a country of 330 million, a rare crime. In 2013 there were about 14,000 murders total. If half of those were black males, that is *still* only 7000. If we are **generous** and say all those murders were committed by unique individuals, we still have 7000 males out of how many millions? This means that 99.9% of black people you  meet have never killed anyone, and will never kill anyone. Sure, you could say that for other races it is 99.99, or 99.999, but 0.01 is still an infinitesimal amount of people no matter how you slice it. To top it off the bulk of these murders can again be traced back to about a dozen or so places. Most of them dealing with drugs. The idea that black people are just running around killing everyone is a myth. To make it more personal, has any black person ever put their hands on you? Assaulted you? Murdered someone you know? My guess is no, and it will probably never happen.\n\nAnother common misconception seen on reddit is \"black people kill white people like 10 bajilliion times more than white people kill black people.\" Technically true, but misleading. Let's leave out the fact that gross population differences will screw with these numbers, as this post is long enough as is, and just stick with the same line of reasoning as before. In 2013, the amount of whites murdered by blacks was around 350. Not 350,000, not 3500....350. If you're white in this country the chances of a black person killing you is essentially zero percent. You're 10 times more likely to die of food poisoning, and how often are you worried about that?\n\n&gt; So basically, I feel like if we brought our kids up to not see color and talk about Americans as Americans, rather than african-american, asian american, etc, racism would soon become a thing of the past\n\nIt's odd that you say this, while admitting earlier that you're a racist. Racism cannot be solved by simply ignoring it. If you think it can, then indulge me with examples of *any* problem with society that was changed through people ignoring the problem. I'd be surprised if you could give me a singe example."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Research also indicated that such a temperature difference makes a massive difference in the amount of time needed for said coffee to cause burns and therefore the dangers associated with the drink.\n\nSuch a difference between McDonald's coffee and other coffee in the city means that a customer has a reasonable expectation for coffee at any given restaurant to be in a similar range of temperature.

I agree with this wholeheartedly, as the discipline has become central to civic and economic literacy in the 21st century.  But to argue, as some have, that this should *replace* the traditional \"algebra to calculus\" high school math sequence makes about as much sense to me as arguing that history should replace English.  While the two undoubtedly share some skills and mechanics, they are fundamentally different disciplines with fundamentally different roles in the curriculum, and both are necessary for a complete education.\n\n\nAlthough the underlying mechanics of statistics are undoubtedly mathematical, increasingly it is becoming recognized as a discipline in its own right, with its own methodology and best practices distinct from those of pure mathematics, and the structure of high school should reflect this divergence.  At the high school level, the focus of statistics pedagogy should be on core concepts, the appropriate use of technology, and interpretation-- you are teaching a student to turn data into an accurate, precise probablistic statement, and to have an intuitive understanding of the probability concepts underlying the meaning of that statement.  These are important skills, but they aren't really *mathematical* skills in the traditional sense; you are reasoning in a different mode.  \n\n\nIn a well-taught algebra, geometry, or calculus class, by contrast, students learn to reason deductively rather than inductively, learn the theory underlying core mathematical notions such as function and equivalence, solve non-routine problems, and use mathematics of all types to analyze real-world phenomena.  None of these skills except arguably the last play any role in an elementary statistics curriculum.  \n\n\nYou can argue that a deep facility with \"abstract\" math has little importance in the \"real world,\" but increasingly the 21st century economy *does* reward individuals who have a high capacity for abstraction and problem-solving, even if you are never directly using specific skills (the classic \"when will I ever need the quadratic formula in real life\" bugbear).  Finally, learning these mathematical concepts is a necessary prerequisite for any further study in STEM fields, which statistics training will not replace.  Thus, BOTH statistics and math, as separate disciplines, should have a role in the high school curriculum.\n\n\nAs a final note, I should mention that I am here presupposing that both statistics and pure math can are taught *well.*  Obviously, a well-taught statistics class is much more useful than a poorly-taught math class, and vice-versa.  I'm well aware that bad mathematics teaching (and bad statistics teaching, for that matter) is rampant in the U.S., so I'd prefer to keep the horror stories along those lines out of this particular discussion and stay focused on the best-case possibilities of both subjects.\n\n\n\n\n**To those of you more interested in debating the logistical nuts and bolts (concerns about burdensome mandates on schools, etc.):** thank you also for your participation in the conversation.  Some have made arguments that all state mandates on school curriculum are unnecessarily burdensome or will cost too much; I believe this premise has empirically denied, so these arguments are not convincing to me.  Others have made the point that, in the event that states are unwilling to add new credit hours to their diploma requirements, we risk adding statistics at the expense of electives or core courses.  This is a more compelling argument, but ultimately a risk I am willing to take, since I believe that in most if not all states there is room in the existing credit structure to responsibly add statistics in place of at least one course.  As a separate issue, I think increasing credit hour minimums and extended school days are serious proposals that should be given consideration as possibilities, though it is not my intent to make a full argument in favor of them here.  Unless you have something substantially different to offer than the above two arguments, I doubt I will be convinced by further discussion along these lines.\n\n\nThank you again to all who responded.\n\nFirst Reply:\nThere was a [related thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3eqdj5/cmv_a_statistics_course_should_be_required_as/) about a month back. I think [what I said then](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3eqdj5/cmv_a_statistics_course_should_be_required_as/cthkp5o) applies here: if we have to chose, discrete math is more valuable than statistics.\n\nThis is mostly going to be an argument that discrete math should replace something in the calculus-track curriculum. However, many introductory discrete math courses spend a fair amount of time covering statistics, and I think that's very valuable for many of the same reasons you've covered. I think that discrete math courses typically paint a very coherent story up to statistics -- much more so than jumping straight into statistics. You talk about deductive reasoning, set theory, combinatorics, and probability before getting to statistics. I think learning and understanding all of those things helps frame statistics in a more intuitive way. For example, Bayes' Theorem (which is, in my experience, a topic in most introductory statistics courses) is much better understood with a firm understanding of deductive reasoning, set theory, and probability.\n\nYou say this about calculus-track curricula: \n\n&gt; In a well-taught algebra, geometry, or calculus class, by contrast, students learn to reason deductively rather than inductively, learn the theory underlying core mathematical notions such as function and equivalence, solve non-routine problems, and use mathematics of all types to analyze real-world phenomena.\n\nI fervently agree that learning to reason deductively is important. Wouldn't you say that a better way to learn deductive reasoning is to teach it directly? \n\n&gt; You can argue that a deep facility with \"abstract\" math has little importance in the \"real world,\" but increasingly the 21st century economy does reward individuals who have a high capacity for abstraction and problem-solving, even if you are never directly using specific skills (the classic \"when will I ever need the quadratic formula in real life\" bugbear). Finally, learning these mathematical concepts is a necessary prerequisite for any further study in STEM fields, which statistics training will not replace. Thus, BOTH statistics and math, as separate disciplines, should have a role in the high school curriculum.\n\nAgain -- totally agree abstract reasoning is important. I just don't think calculus or algebra are the best topics to teach this skill to the average student. Too often they devolve into rote application of formula or theorems that have no meaning to the student. Teaching deductive reasoning directly generally doesn't suffer from this problem, because the theorems that do exist are incredibly intuitive.\n\nIn closing, I'd propose that a better change to high school math curriculum would be:\n\n1. For the general population, teach discrete math instead of (pre-)calculus. Topics should include deductive reasoning, set theory, probability, and statistics.\n2. For more advanced students, offer followup courses in both statistics and calculus.  (I guess this is probably already the case at most good schools).\nSecond Reply:\nI haven't really seen this point brought up here, so I may as well: you seem to be assuming the typical algebra/trig/precalc/calc track is representative of pure math. Many would disagree with that. Calculus and the classes leading up to it are a notoriously horrible representation of pure mathematics and, while I don't really have a great argument against putting statistics into standard high school educations (apart from the lack-of-resources argument others have mentioned), I can at least argue that, whether or not statistics is thrown in, calculus should probably be thrown out.\n\nI'm just going to preemptively say, though - Lockhart did a much better job articulating it than I can in his short paper [A Mathematician's Lament](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf). I don't mean to pass the debating on to someone else, but if you've got time I'd really recommend reading it.\n\nThe main point is that calculus and the courses leading up to it are far too rooted in applications - they're treated as though they're going to be useful to students later in life, because in the minds of administrators, that's how putting them in the curriculum is justified. Because of that, teachers and students alike end up perpetuating the myth that math is, at its core, supposed to be useful and applicable. That's entirely the wrong idea, though. There is math that's useful, but applications aren't the reason we practice math, nor the reason we're interested in it. The real value of math is that it's beautiful, interesting, and most of all personally enriching. It helps develop important parts of our minds, from articulating ideas to critical thinking to problem solving. Calculus is the centerpiece of the high school math education not because it's beautiful or enriching but because it's perceived to be useful, and that's harmful to students (who, generally speaking, waste time learning it without ever using it) and to the general population (who, generally speaking, regard math as a tedious object to be wielded only for the purposes of science).\n\nSo, if the people creating high school curricula wanted to put in a \"math\" class that's actually useful, statistics would be a much better choice, I'm sure. I believe many more people would find themselves being able to apply it to their daily lives. I would hope the world doesn't forget what math actually is, though, and I would hope that, whether statistics is added or not, calculus is either replaced (by something that's actually done for its own value) or dropped entirely.

Or at the very least, various 'Normal' states to make up a 'Normal' human being.\n\nAnything that is in the majority is a 'Normal' state. So, the 'Normal' human being is a Cisgendered, Heterosexual, Chinese man.\n\nThis means that states such as Transgender, Homosexual, Autistic etc. are not 'Normal'. They are in fact 'different'. and we desperately need to stop acting as if they are normal. They are different.\n\nThis does not mean they are worse, undesirable or negative. Nor does it mean they are better, desirable or positive. They are simply different.\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nI would say there's too many variables at play to designate one type of person as normal as then too many people are outliers.\n\nTake, for example, ethnicity. While the largest ethnicity group is Chinese, there are more non-Chinese as a whole, so how can an overall (in the scale of the global population) minority be considered 'normal'?\n\nThen, when you add in other factors, gender, handedness, hair colour, eye colour etc. There actually very few 'normal' people which pretty much defeats the purpose.\nSecond Reply:\nYou are looking at in on the wrong scale, across hundereds of animal species it is normal to find a small percentage of homosexual individuals, thus it is perfectly normal to find that a small pefcentage of humans are homosexual.\n\n\n\nHomosexual people do make up a small but significant percentage of humans, and when people say that it is not normal they do not mean it is not the norm, they mean it is not normative (as in the common and correct way of going about things).\n\n\n\nThere are combinations of hair and eye colour that are less common then homosexuality, there is never any question of whether or not these are normal, normality only comes up when it is accompanied by a value judgement.\n\n\n\nEven if there were no distiction of normal vs normative then you are left having to find a demarcation for what percentage of a population does something have to be for it to be concidered normal or not, and unless you have that clearly defined point and do not move it around to suit your value judgments, then you have no basis for throwing normal or abnormal around."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The West Bank and Gaza strip together have 6,000 square kilometers of land. The North Sinai Governorate alone has 27,000 square Kilometers of land, that's more land than even Isreal has (22,000 sq km).\n\n[Here is what a State of Palestine could look like on a map, either with only the Northern part or the full peninsula.](http://sinaimaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/governorates-sinai-egypt.jpg)\n\nOne could argue that the Sinai Peninsula is mostly desert and unfit for people to live in, but Israel was mostly desert when they began immigrating to the region too. Irrigation, agriculture, forestry, and artificial canals have been known to combat or reverse desertification.\n\nThe people already residing there can be promised equal citizenship rights in the new state of Palestine. Egypt could even allow for the people there to have duel citizenship, so that they can choose to either stay in the new state or easily move to inland Egypt. If necessary, Egypt could offer incentives for Sinai people to move inland prior to the establishment of the state.\n\nIf a \"buffer\" line/zone were felt to be necessary, it could be jointly run by Israel and Egypt stationed outside the borders without much issue from the Palestinians. The U.N. Security council could send peacekeepers to the peninsula to monitor the region's development. There would be very little reason for any of the Security members to veto this decision if Egypt, Israel, and Palestine all agreed to this.\n\nAlbeit, it's extremely unlikely this will ever happen, but I think it would be a good solution. Which is why I'm here, what is wrong with this plan?\n\nFirst Reply:\nOne basic way of refuting this idea is by simply looking at the current situation in the Sinai Peninsula. \n\n\n\nFirst, the region has always been populated by people. The native bedouin people have lived in that region far longer than you seem to be giving them credit for. Most of them migrated there between 1300 and 1700. Quite a long time for a place that so inhospitable. \n\nAlso, Israel might have been \"mostly dessert\" but the whole reason we need a Palestine state is because of the millions of people the Israel state forced into refugee status by making them leave. It might have been mostly dessert, but damn, it was home to a lot of people. \n\nEgypt certainly could offer the things you mentioned to the Bedouin people. Egypt has abjectly refused to do so, and has created a terrible caste system whereby terrorist groups have thrived in the region, so I do not see this happening anytime soon. But sure, in a perfect world, that could theoretically happen. (Are you familiar at all with what is going on in this region??, are we talking about the same Egypt, the northern Africa country that has gone through three leaders in the past five years? The one with the pyramids?)\n\nI'm not even sure I want to talk about a buffer zone right now. Its late, and the current buffer zone is being executed so terribly and horrendously right now that I do not think that term should be uttered in geopolitical conversations concerning this region. \n\nI guess more than anything I am confused by your view prompt. Are you saying that if the things you mentioned happened that a Palestine state could thrive? \n\nI mean if the planets align and ponies sprout wings with rainbows coming out their butts, then yea sure this might happen. I would rather you suggest Utah as a solution, or maybe suggest building an island in the middle of the ocean out of old two litter bottles of soda. At least then, there is a more realistic possibility. \nSecond Reply:\n1) What do you propose is done with the West Bank?\n\n2) Even ignoring the difficulty of actually growing crops in the Sinai, Israeli efforts to reduce desertification were possible only due to large amounts of foreign funds and resources that poured into the state after its foundation. The Palestinian diaspora has no such source of funding, hence it is doubtful that they would be able to actually water in a climate that is even more harsh than Israel's is, on average.\n\n3) Israel is generally thought of as being one of the most over-populated areas in the world, relative to it's carrying capacity. It is possible that global warming will exacerbate the issue along with the changing climate, and this would also likely apply to the Palestinian Sinai.\n\n4) Egypt won't sign on to it because it weakens their hold over the Suez Canal by putting a foreign nation on the other bank pretty close to the canal.\n\n5) Palestine won't sign on to it because, let's face it, they just won't. You're implicitly saying that the Palestinians should be forced to move out of their present lands for no reason other than their own ethnicity.\n\n6) Israel won't sign on to it because lately the Israeli government has been against the establishment of any Arab Palestinian government in the region."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Despite having surgery, having that mindset and having hormone treatment, I can't feel fully comfortable referring to them as a woman - just from a technical standpoint. I feel as though I'm lying to myself.\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nI am not homophobic or anything of the sort. I completely agree with people doing what they want to do and I completely believe people can be 'trapped' in the body of the opposite gender.\nFirst Reply:\n&gt;I feel as though I'm lying to myself.\n\nWhy? And what 'technical standpoint' are you referring to? Gender is mostly a surface level set of assumptions we make about other people to orient which social norms we should apply when interacting with them. Sure, biology has some influence and in a *very* few realms, might be a concern, but in terms of how we treat people in a day-to-day environment there's no reason trans people are not their gender.\nSecond Reply:\nTrans people are not uniformly the same as their supposed pre-transition sex. There are *biological* differences between trans people and their pre-trans sex. These include genetic differences, and differences in the brain.\n\n**Genetic differences found only in trans individuals:**\n\nMtF Trans individuals have been found to have genetic differences that cause their biology to bind testosterone differently than males.\n\n&gt;The androgen receptor (AR), also known as NR3C4, is activated by the binding of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone, where it plays a critical role in the forming of primary and secondary male sex characteristics. Hare et al. found that male-to-female transsexuals were found to have longer repetitions of the gene, which reduced its effectiveness at binding testosterone.\n\n**Brain structure differences found only in trans individuals:**\n\n&gt;Zhou et al. (1995) found that in a region of the brain called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc), a region known for sex and anxiety responses, MTF transsexuals have a female-normal size while FTM transsexuals have a male-normal size. While the transsexuals studied had taken hormones, this was accounted for by including non-transsexual male and female controls who, for a variety of medical reasons, had experienced hormone reversal. The controls still retained sizes typical for their gender.\n\nand\n\n&gt;The interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3), part of the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus. The same method of controlling for hormone usage was used as in Zhou et al. (1995) and Kruijver et al. (2000). The differences were even more pronounced than with BSTc; control males averaged 1.9 times the volume and 2.3 times the neurons as control females, yet once again, regardless of hormone exposure, MTF transsexuals lay within the female range and the FTM transsexual within the male range.\n\n**Prenatal androgen exposure:**\n\n&gt;Prenatal androgen exposure, the lack thereof, or poor sensitivity to prenatal androgens are commonly cited mechanisms to explain the above discoveries. Schneider, Pickel, and Stalla (2006) found a correlation between digit ratio (a generally accepted marker for prenatal androgen exposure) and male to female transsexualism. MTF transsexuals were found to have a higher digit ratio than control males, but one that was comparable to control females\n\nSo no, they were not \"technically their own original gender\", because their original biological characteristics did not conform to a typical member of their supposed previous sex in the first place.\n\nDoes this help change your view?\n\n[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_transsexualism)"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I do make an exception for diets which are unsustainable and will eventually cause either malnutrition or an eating disorder etc\u2026 but some diets, such as gluten free or dairy free, do not cause this issue, and the individuals feel great when they do it, whether or not it is a placebo or a result of other factors is irrelevant. I see a lot of hate on people who follow these diets on the internet and in person and I don\u2019t really understand why. If the individuals is an adult and chooses to practice this lifestyle we should respect it as much as we respect individuals who practice their religions. In both cases I agree that if they shove it in people\u2019s faces and try to convert people they know, it is annoying, but if they keep to themselves and understand that it is not for everyone, I don't see a reason for all the hate on people who follow these lifestyles.\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nThe key difference is that religion is an important social and family custom that people cannot easily discard.  People are raised in their religion.  Their families adhere to it and bond over it.  They go home for the high holy days or break the ramadan fast together. \n\nPeople find deep solace and meaning in religion as well.  For many people, it has helped them through dark or difficult times, and religious scriptures may have been what they fell back on when nothing else was looking good for them.\n\nNone of that is the case for a fad diet.\nSecond Reply:\nI agree it's bad to make fun of a person's diet, but it's not as bad as making fun of their religion.\n\nWhen you make fun of a person's religion, you're making fun of an important part of their identity, and you're making fun of their community, and people they respect, and their family, and all of their ancestors.\n\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In a world where people are starving this is in my opinion morally not justifiable. \n* Most importantly: They produce greenhouse gases - and quite a lot of them!

Or, demonstrating why the Golden Rule is flawed as a premise in the first place.\n\nI invite you to CMV.\n\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nThese are good rules of thumb for \"civil behaviour\" i.e. an etiquette, a how-to-act when in society, but they are not at the core or morality. How we treat each others is a secondary concern/consequence - how we treat ourselves is primary - it has existential primacy, which means it is more fundamental. (This primacy of how we treat ourselves is implied by the gold and silver rules, but not the platinum). \n\nThe core of morality is that the individual has the capacity to choose, and all choices have different consequences that one choice is better and of greater value than another. To deliberately choose a greater value over the lesser is the core of morality, and to choose the bad over the good is the core of immorality.\n\nThe Gold and Silver rules are only as good as this more fundamental aspect of morality, how you treat yourself. Even Robinson Crusoe, alone on an island, has choices to make that make him either a virtuous man who works hard and struggles to do the right things to survive, or an immoral man who ignores his circumstances and chooses to laze on the beach wishing vainly for the coconuts to fall.\n\nThere are thousands of virtues (and vices) that have nothing to do with others, but that require a sustained effort of moral/righteous choices to attain *such as*: self-honesty, integrity, clarity of mind, industry, productiveness, rationality, creativity, focus/concentration, imagination, pride, courage, determination, knowing when to reward/punish yourself, knowing when to push on or rest etc etc!\n\nThe Golden and Silver rules are only as useful to society as the virtues you have yourself! (The platinum sounds like a nightmare of second-guessing other people's thoughts...I'm a bit iffy on that one).\nSecond Reply:\nThe Golden rule is obviously deeply flawed, because people want very different things.  The Platinum rule gets around this, but there are more than a few problems with it.\n\n1. Uncertainty.  It is often hard to know what others want.  It's a nice idea to treat others they want to be treated, but in practice that's hard to do.\n\n2. What a person wants may require you doing an immoral act.  If a heroin addict wants you to give them heroin, does that mean it is moral to do so?\n\n3. Conflict.  Often the wants of one person may be in conflict with another.  A person may not want to be put in prison, but if they are killing people, it is moral to put them there for the protection of others.

Countries should have a 'no confidence' vote in elections if they want to increase turnout, while achieving a better understanding of the public's perception of the political climate.\nIn New Zealand between the last two elections there was a significant increase in funding pushing for a better voting turnout. For many years now they have made it compulsory to register, however measures such as these seem to be highly ineffective globally at getting an increased turnout in elections, not just NZ. There was less than a 5% increase in voting in the last election despite it being a far more prominent election due to the kim dot com saga. National, our right wing party won so promisingly they were able to not form a coalition with other groups (this is almost unheard of in NZ). Many of my peers did not vote, nor did I as we believed that john key was a poor choice for a leader, but there was a lack of any leader that appealed to this group of 10 of us. We all agreed at the time that if there was a vote that had no significance in the election other than to measure those people who do not believe we have any valid current person running for prime minister we would not only have a higher turnout at the election with little effort, but we'd also have a better idea of what the general perception was on the stability of the political scene. This would help us to build a better political scene long term and involve the voter, ultimately resulting in higher voting turnout at a fraction of the cost or social effort and would result in a better turnout. This would theoretically apply globally too, as in countries such as the US it could be used to show many things, not just the (lack of) confidence in either leader, but also other things.

If none, I think it won't have much effect.\n\nThe US state of Nevada has had a choice called [\"none of these candidates\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None_of_These_Candidates) since 1975, but it lacks any force, and even if it gets more votes than any other choice, the actual person who got the most votes is elected.\n\nIn the last Presidential election, [Nevada had slightly lower than average turnout.](http://www.electproject.org/2012g)\nSecond Reply:\nWhat would the purpose of this vote be? I mean, you can't just elect nobody?\n\nWhen there is an election, somehow, a decision has to be made. And in a democracy, it is normally the people deciding which one from the list of candidates they want to choose. However, electing nobody is not a choice. Therefore I think adding a \"no confidence\" would only encourage the average voter to distance himself from every candidate and refuse his vote.\nIf someone is really unhappy about the way politics work, he should be able to participate himself as a politician.

I'm not saying we would be at world peace thereafter, but we could have taken advantage of that unity to seriously reduce international conflict.\n\nClimate change. Need I say more? The Bush years saw inaction on global climate change that has endangered every country on earth.\n\nImperialism. The expansion of the War on Terror to Iraq and other groups was correlated with a rise of police militarization (in the US) and espionage (globally) and led to the installation of treasonous quisling governments around Europe.\n\nEconomic instability. The 2008 housing bubble (heavily concentrated in, you guessed it, Florida) triggered a global financial crisis that the world has yet to recover from. The progress that the world's 99%, overwhelmingly located in developing countries like China and India, made during the 2000s has almost completely been [reversed](http://blogs-images.forbes.com/timworstall/files/2015/01/oxfam1.jpg) by this fucking crisis. Global equity markets are now [as US-centric](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-the-map-of-the-world-if-size-was-determined-by-market-cap-2015-08-12) as they've ever been since at least the Eighties, meaning that \"the rise of the rest\" has been an utter illusion.\n\nErosion in quality of living. In addition to the phony \"development\" of countries like China and India, Western countries have seen a large absolute drop in well-being due to the financial crisis of the Bush years, a drop which treaties like TPP and TTIP may well enshrine into law.\n\nTL;DR: If the world is a dystopia in 2200, George W. Bush will be (rightfully or not) blamed.\n\n\nFirst Reply:\n&gt; The much disputed election in Florida was a huge challenge to the world's second-largest democracy. Having the Supreme Court effectively appoint a president upon party lines significantly hurt faith in the US political process and led to the polarization that has led to the Do-Nothing Congresses of 2006-2008 and 2010-.\n\nDifferent methods of counting ballots led to different results.  The methods originally used by the state of Florida, the one proposed by Al Gore's campaign in his lawsuit, and the one used by the Supreme Court all tallied GWB as victor.  The one proposed by the Florida State Supreme Court had Al Gore winning.  I think a newspaper-sponsored recount after the fact (with another, different set of standards) also found that Al Gore got more votes.\n\nBasically, it was a tie, and it turns out in that case the Supreme Court is the tiebreaker.\n\n&gt; Bush's decision to go to war in Iraq eroded the brief period of global consensus that saw countries from Iran to Russia united in sympathy with the USA against Al-Qaeda. I'm not saying we would be at world peace thereafter, but we could have taken advantage of that unity to seriously reduce international conflict.\n\nHow?  When has something like that ever happened?  In reality, there was a large body of international opinion that the US should not even go into Afghanistan after Al Queda.  Many foreign governments were on board with it, but their peoples weren't.  If we'd never gone into Iraq all the same people would still hate us.\n\n&gt; Climate change. Need I say more? The Bush years saw inaction on global climate change that has endangered every country on earth.\n\nDo you seriously think Obama has made any serious progress on global climate change? How about Clinton?  If the US quit using coal tomorrow it would have no practical effect on climate change.  You need an international consensus and, obviously, electing Obama had no effect on that.\n\n&gt; Imperialism. The expansion of the War on Terror to Iraq and other groups was correlated with a rise of police militarization (in the US) and espionage (globally) \n\nCorrelation is not causation.  And if our espionage had been better we would never have gone to war in Iraq in the first place.\n\n&gt; and led to the installation of **treasonous quisling governments** around Europe.\n\n... What in the world are you talking about?\n\n&gt; Economic instability. The 2008 housing bubble (heavily concentrated in, you guessed it, Florida) triggered a global financial crisis that the world has yet to recover from. \n\nGuess who forced mortgage giants to start using subprime mortgages in the first place?  Guess who kept Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from being audited in 2005?  Guess who's decided to still keep them alive today?  In all three cases, it was democrats, not GWB.\n\n&gt; The progress that the world's 99%, overwhelmingly located in developing countries like China and India, made during the 2000s has almost completely been reversed by this fucking crisis.\n\nI don't understand how \"share of global wealth\" is a good way to look at well-being.  A better measure is how many people worldwide are actually living in poverty, and [there are fewer and fewer of them](http://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/world-poverty/).\nSecond Reply:\nFirst, let me say that I believe Bush was a horrible president, and the country is considerably the worse due to his \"leadership\".  But, I think you are way overstating his influence.\n\n**Bush v. Gore**\nYes, I think the Supremes blew it.  But it was in some ways a testament to our democracy that everyone accepted the process.  The peaceful transition of power, particularly in an unsatisfying way (and whichever way it went, half the country was going to be unsatisfied) is still relatively rare in the world.  I'm far more concerned about Citizens United or gutting the Voting Rights Act, which I think we have a much greater impact on elections and the governance than the Bush v. Gore where I can at least understand the votes.\n\n**Squandered Opportunity for peace**  Agreed, we dropped the ball on this one.  But it wouldn't have stopped Russia's love of imperialism.  It wouldn't have stopped Muslim extremism in the Middle East.  Maybe an FDR could have forged something out of it - but Gore wasn't talented enough of a politician to create a coalition of nations dedicated to wiping out the poverty and ignorance that leads to extremism.  And it was early enough in his term that he wouldn't have the skills, relationships or staff capable of helping him accomplish this.\n\n**Climate change** Congress was not going to pass legislation that would hobble the US economy for the sake of the future.  The threat isn't immediate enough (or perceived as certain enough by most people) for people to support the sort of extreme action that would be required.  Yes, Gore would have worked to reduce our speed in that direction, but he alone couldn't have made a significant enough difference.  He wasn't charismatic enough.  Plus, post 9/11, people would have had other priorities.\n\n**Imperialism**.  Americans were scared shitless after 9/11.  Gore would have been forced to respond.  Likely, as a democrat, he's be under huge pressure to not \"be soft\" on terrorism.  I don't think he would have invaded Iraq, but probably would have done so in Afghanistan.  He would have also taken similar steps on domestic spying.  Remember, this is a guy whose wife lead the \"parental advisory warning on CD's\" movement - not a huge civil libertarian.\n\n**Economic Instability** This can't all be pinned on Bush by a long shot.  [NPR did a great series](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/355/the-giant-pool-of-money) on how the global economic boom created this unprecedented pile of money that needed to be invested somewhere, which lead to the popularity of \"mortgage-backed securities\", which lead to stupid loans, which lead to the global economic collapse.\n\nThere's no question that the amount of [disposable income in countries like China](http://money.cnn.com/2012/06/26/news/economy/china-middle-class/) has increased dramatically, and poverty has decreased.\n\nYes, the distribution of wealth is still screwed, but there is vastly more wealth, which is benefiting many poorer countries.\n\n**TL;DR: it was a time of missed opportunities, and some screw ups, but I don't think it was a tipping point as you suggest, and that even had Gore been elected, things wouldn't have been dramatically different.**"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

An individual can be completely nice towards everyone except one group of people and that could be because of what he/she was taught by their family or learnt from the society they grew up in.\n\nI don't believe that people hate just for the sake of hating, there are always reasons behind the way you feel towards some one/group and they are usually 'case-by-case'\nSecond Reply:\n&gt;willingness to hate other groups of people they have never met or gotten to know\n\nUnfortunately that is just a very human, universal bias.

Logical, rational people can overcome this bias.\n\nIf anything, Ex-homophobes has demonstrated this ability, so you know they are capable of logically defeating their own bias.\n\nOn the other hand if you are looking for people who don't have any biases at all, you are probably excluding the entire humanity."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

From our forefathers throwing tea into the Boston harbor to Rosa Parks refusing to give up her bus seat, people who have wanted to enact change have accepted that non-violent protest - even when in violation of the law - is sometimes required.\n\nSo long as the people who violate those laws are willing to suffer the consequences of that violation in exchange for the benefit that those violations may bring, then it is a tool in the toolbox for those who want change."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Many businesses take advantage of such people to save costs, and treat their illegal immigrant workers unfairly. \n\nC) The people coming in negatively effect the community by committing crime. According to USA Today, [they represent just 3.5% of the U.S. population, undocumented immigrants represented 7% of federal prison sentences following convictions on charges of sexual abuse, 9% of murders, 12% of assaults and 30% of kidnappings in 2013.\n](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/07/16/voices-gomez-undocumented-immigrant-crime-san-francisco-shooting/30159479/) \n\n\"There's no evidence that immigrants are either more or less likely to commit crimes than anyone else in the population,\" Janice Kephart, a CIS researcher, said last week on the PBS NewsHour.\n\n\nD) Most importantly, by not having a tough stance on illegal immigration, it further encourages illegal immigration. There is always going to be motivation for illegal immigration, so as a country, we should do our best to discourage that behavior. By not actively discouraging illegal immigration, people would be stupid not to try to illegally immigrate.\n\n\nMy view has changed in the sense that I no longer believe that all illegal immigrants should be deported as soon as possible, and you can see my post [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3gt76g/cmv_illegal_immigrants_should_be_deported_and_not/cu1b3o9)\n\nFirst Reply:\n&gt; Let me start off by saying that I am not against legal immigration in anyway, and am only against illegal immigration.

There are legal ways to immigrate into the US, and just because it is harder to do so does not mean you can ignore the law when it is convenient.\n\nThis strikes me as, and I'm going to be honest here, unbearably naive and simplistic.\n\nFirst of all , \"They broke the law and should be punished.\"\n\nOk, but you haven't explained why that punishment *has* to be deportation. Not only is it going to cost the US billions of dollars tracking down and deporting 11 million people, it leaves off the table other methods of punishment. Punishments that could include:\n\nPaying a large fine to the taxpayers\n\nCommunity service\n\nLarger amount of paycheck going to payroll taxes (social security)\n\nLower on the tier list for government job prospects\n\nJust deporting them all isn't good for the country. Certainly not as good a deal as having them pay us money. This also doesn't deal with the problem that most of the jobs they do Americans don't wan to do anyway. And this:\n\n&gt; There are legal ways to immigrate into the US, and just because it is harder to do so does not mean you can ignore the law when it is convenient.\n\nI mean, come on. I hate calling people out but this is just textbook \"American not realizing how good they have it.\"\n\nIf a guy has a hungry family, he isn't just breaking the law because it is \"convenient.\" He's not shoplifting his favorite pair of sneakers. They are taking a **huge** risk coming here, and working a tremendous amount (I believe the average work week for an illegal immigrant is well over 50 hours..close to 60) in order to **not starve.** Honestly, if I was in their position I would do the same thing. Do you really expect people to just say, \"Oh, since it is against the law for me to climb that fence, me and my family are just gonna starve.\" Fuck that. Sending them back because they \"broke a law\" is just flat out immoral. They had to be pretty desperate to take all those risks, uproot themselves from their homes, and move their whole family to a foreign country where they don't even speak the language.\n\n&gt; B) Illegal immigration depresses wages and lowers working conditions. They are willing to work for less, and are much less likely to complain when they are abused. Many businesses take advantage of such people to save costs, and treat their illegal immigrant workers unfairly.\n\nIronically, these problems would all be solved if they were given amnesty.\n\nAs for your crime stats, I'm pretty sure those are misleading / cherrypicked, but I'm not sure so I cannot dispute it. However, it is silly to deport *all* illegals. Just deport the ones caught committing crimes. Much easier, cheaper, and more effective than checking everyones papers whos name is Jose.\nSecond Reply:\nThe 300 pound elephant in the room, and that's kind of a small elephant, but still, is that we need illegals. They work in certain jobs that traditional Americans don't. \n\nAlso, no matter what laws we place, we will never defeat the massive amount of economic incentive for people to come over here. If Americans could make far, far, far more moving to Canada we would make the trip legal or not. \n\nSo the fact that we have job sectors that require illegal work and they will simply come over anyway because of economic incentive, what we need is a much stronger guest worker program.  \n\nThere are people who would love to work the season an then go back to their home countries. Our current laws make this impossible. Once you're here you stay. \n\nIf we had a solid guest worker program it would solve a fair amount of problems. \n\nMore laws are simply going to run into a lot of economic incentive. It is very difficult to counter economic incentive just by laws. "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The problem with no other options available is that prostitution is not as easy as other jobs. Certainly it may be easy to please most Johns, that's not the issue, the issue is that it's not an easy call. Can you imagine yourself working for the sex industry and being required to do a certain amount of dirty things with whoever shows up, as your only option for survival? \n\nYes, it is better than being homeless but it's troubling that people need to provide sex services to survive. It's not easy. I actually have a friend who worked in escorting - The payment is great so it was overall a good experience, but she described as being harsh specially on the psychological side because it's not easy to have sex with strangers and do most things they require\n\n&gt;If I argued that minimum wage jobs should be illegalized because \"Desperate people might feel obligated to work them\", would that make sense?

Being a man myself, I don't like having sex with strangers and I prefer to be committed first - It's a preference (before you ask, no I'm not religious). For most people, having sex with anyone who asks for it is not an easy task.\n\n\nI am divided on prostitution - But I believe it should be decriminalized at least. My problem with regulating fully is that there's no evidence that it does solve the issues it promises to solve. \n\nIf you are open to changing your mind, read this \n\nhttp://www.embracedignity.org/uploads/10Reasons.pdf\n\nRegardless of who wrote it and which websites host that paper you should take a look. Most of all, my problem is that street prostitution, pimping, abuse and trafficking have not disappeared. Yes, health wise things are improving, but don't you think it's curious that a significant part of Amsterdam's prostitutes are foreigners/immigrants? Do you think it's ok that the majority of prostitutes according to many studies start before the age of 18? Do you think legalizing and regulating will erase issues? I'm not exactly concerned about bodily autonomy or stigmas, but with the workers themselves. The fact you need to do something to survive doesn't mean that activity is good for you. \nSecond Reply:\nI agree that sex work should be legal, but your methods don't seem like they would be sufficient for harm reduction. Because of the high up front cost of running and regulating a brothel, you'd see them institute a robust hiring process that would screen out many current sex workers for a variety of reasons, perhaps most commonly the fact that they arE homeless, undocumented, or simply  won't look \"good\" enough to attract brothel customers. So you'll still have a thriving trade of street based sex work etc. that will actually provide exactly zero extra protection for the sex workers who will still be a exactly as much risk of being thrown in jail as they were before legalization."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

This can have positive effects like a sense of belonging, cooperation and division of burdens. However, to make a group, each member has to have something in common, other than just being human. It could be gender, race, a common vision or belief. You get the idea.\n\nSo by uniting based on common characteristics, we automatically exclude those who don't fit the mould. Thus creating every kind of discrimination you can think of.\n\nThe worst part is, if you look at groups of people looking to reduce discrimination, they're as much as part of the problem as the original perpetrators. One example of this in action is the reporter who was kicked out of a Black Lives event in CSU. African Americans have a long history of mistreatment in the US and many have the right to be furious. But the problem is that they see all \"whites\" as being the perpetrators of this mistreatment and exacerbate the \"white vs black\" dichotomy. \n\nMy opinion on how to solve these issues is this: I've been told that to solve problems as a couple, you mustn't make it \"you\" vs \"partner\", you have to make it \"both of you as a couple\" vs \"the problem\". So I think we should apply the same logic to racism and sexism. Women vs men and whites vs blacks (only two of the uncountable amount of dichotomies that exist) can't be solved by separating and pointing fingers at the other group, it can only be solved by uniting. There is no Us vs Them, only Us.\n\nPerhaps you've suffered discrimination first hand (as I have) and disagree with my opinion because you want justice above all. In which case, please explain your opinion.\n\nFirst Reply:\nI think you're overlooking the fact that most of the progress that we've made so far (racism, sexism, etc.) has been because members of both groups have united against the problem. For example, when women finally achieved the right to vote it wasn't simply because all women wanted to vote, while all men didn't want this; members of both groups united and tackled the problem.\n\nBut there's always blowback because not everyone wants to join, not everyone is as progressive as you think they are. Your view is (slightly) naive because it doesn't take into account that there are those people who accept (an out of balance) status quo and are willing to defend it. A simple example on Reddit is TRP. Feminists welcome men and women to work for the equality of women, but this doesn't go down too well with everyone so there are counter-movements. TRP is an example of a lot of stupid people who aren't comfortable with change because they don't understand it or because they feel that it's going too far.\nSecond Reply:\n&gt; Women vs men and whites vs blacks (only two of the uncountable amount of dichotomies that exist) can't be solved by separating and pointing fingers at the other group, it can only be solved by uniting.\n\nThis sounds great on the surface, but fails horribly in practice. Most racism and sexism happens subconsciously. A white man is going to want to hire other white men. It's not that he's racist; it's just that we like people that are like us. Unless you point out this behavior and make him conscious of it, it will continue on forever.\n\nLikewise, a police department may arrest black people at a higher proportion than white people. It's not that they are racist, but the arrest records show that black people are more likely to be criminals; a connection is made in your mind. Making it a visible topic, you get the chance to consider whether black people really *are* more likely to be criminals, or if it is a self-perpetuating bias."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

People who believe that someone is selfish for committing or wanting to commit suicide just because it makes those around them sad then they are actually the ones who are selfish because they'd rather someone suffer than have them end their misery and be forced to grieve their death. I think there are instances where suicide is selfish (people who have children that still rely on them) but if you have no responsibilities such as that then it could be your reasons are actually very selfless. Furthermore I think that calling people who struggle with suicidal thoughts \"selfish\" is extremely insensitive and misguided as I'd tend to believe that most people who off themselves are doing it for reasons they perceive to be for the greater good. CMV!\nFirst Reply:\nSelfish means lacking in consideration of others. *The suicide person might not be thinking of others. The person whos calling the suicider selfish though is probably thinking of other people who will be harmed by this. \n\nNow if it was only a family of 2 though and 1 sister wanted to commit suicide I can see how both would be selfish but that usually isnt the case.\n\nSo, whether or not someone is selfish is really about whether or not their actions/advice only benefit themselves. *Suicide people might be only thinking about themselves and therefore might be selfish.\n\nEDIT: I realized while in discussion I cant assume the majority of suicide peoples motives. Therefore, I will simply stick with the accuser's, who are more reliable.\nSecond Reply:\nI would say that both are correct. The person who commits suicide and the person who expects someone who wants to commit suicide not to do it are both thinking about themselves and their own values. More importantly, their actions are chosen.\n\nI personally think that everything people consciously choose to do is inherently selfish as they are carrying out their own whims, regardless of how their actions may or may not affect others. Because when it's all said and done even if what they did helped others and inconvenienced them it was still what they wanted to do so they were still just satisfying their own desires. And that to me is selfish, which consequently makes those who commit and those who oppose suicide selfish."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

You're wearing some pretty expensive clothes (lets say 500 pounds) that will no doubt be ruined if you jump into the river. Saving this child doesn't put you in danger as you can stand in this river while the child being smaller cannot. Do you jump into that river to save that child? \n\nLet's say you encounter that same river with a different child in it the next day while wearing your rolex watch. Do you jump into that river to save the child? \n\nNow lets look at the real world. More than 1.3 billion people live in extreme poverty (less than 80p a day) and 7.6 million children are estimated to have died before their 5th birthday in 2010. Many of these are from poverty, preventable diseases and illnesses. Money can help provide infrastructure for schools, hospitals, sanitation facilities, vaccinations etc which no doubt will help reduce child mortality rates. Once you look at the world through this lens then it is easy enough to look at the world in terms of opportunity cost. This iphone or 100 life saving vaccinations. An expensive house or cheap government housing and a new well providing water for a village. One may argue that there is a difference between the example and this and that is distance. These children are much further away but I don't see how that dilutes your moral responsibility to them. Therefore, it seems that any money that you keep must be worth a child's life, education etc or be allocated to some other duty such as child rearing where you have a responsibility to give time and money (for schools, healthcare etc) to make sure that your child grows up to be a socially productive member of society. I know that sounds like a very cold perspective on what parenting is about but i couldn't think of another way to phrase it haha.\n\nI will assume that most people think that you should save the child but this specifically is why I would save the child. I'm looking at this from the stance of virtue ethics (Aquinas) and I believe that by allowing this child to die shows a lack of charity and isn't positively building character. I can't justify losing a life in exchange for 500 pounds.\n\nBut,  I think even taken from the stance of consequentialism (believing that consequences should inform your moral thinking) or deontological ethics (believing that laws inform your moral stance) you would still reach the eventual conclusion that you must jump into that river:\n\nConsequentialism (i.e. Utilitarianism):\nYou would have to argue that having 500 pounds will lead to greater pleasure/happiness than that life and I don't think you can justify that.\n\nDeontological ethics (i.e. Kant):\nI only really understand Kant so he's the one that I will briefly (very briefly) talk about but allowing that child to die breaks the categorical imperative as if you allowed that act to become universal you would be devaluing human life by saying that it has a price tag.\n\nI've only briefly talked about why I think the child should be saved as I take it as a assumption that most people would save the child but I will be willing to discuss my ethical stance more thoroughly if anyone asks me about it but i didn't want my post to only appeal to those who have studied philosophy.\n\nThanks for your answers!\n\nFirst Reply:\nYou could literally spend a lifetime reading the different philosophical responses that come up to this challenge, so rather than trying to formulate the argument that I think is the most convicing, I might jsut ask you which of the following arguments you think sounds most likely to convince you, and then give a basic summary of the kind of argument that ususally entails.\n\nAdditionally, I really don't think you sufficiently dealt with Kantian ethics at all (I wasn't convinced by your account of the categorical imperative, and you ignored the other components of Kantian ethics, which I actually think make a stronger case for you, specifically the second formulation), and it seems like you misunderstood virtue ethics: it isn't about maximising behaviour that conforms with a particular virtue, it's about cultivating the virtue itself. Virtue ethics demands that you are a charitable person, not that you perform maximally charitable actions. Under an Aristotelean framework (which is essentially what Aquinas operates under), it's very easy to be *too* charitable, as well, which I think is worth considering. \n\nRegardless though, some common critiques of the view your espousing would be:\n\n- It's impossible to accurately quantify 'happiness' in such a way that would allow you to make the assumptions you're making\n\n- Ethics isn't the highest thing we should aspire to\n\n- You have unique ethical responsibilities to people who are closer to you (i.e. that space is morally relevant)\n\n- Utilitarianism is heavily flawed, and your argument doesn't really work for any other major school of ethics\n\n- This position contradicts common-sense morality, which is what all moral systems aspire to emulate\n\nDo any of those sound like they could maybe change your view?\n\nSecond Reply:\nYour argument is based on the notion that money can fix all of the problems that impoverished people face.  This is simply not true.  Sure, money can build a school, but it won't change the fact that millions of people live in a place that can barely produce food (and is losing even that ability with a changing climate).  It doesn't change the fact that the politics of many of these regions are such that any resources sent there will immediately be confiscated by warlords.\n\nSure, my $25 could help feed someone...if the food was actually able to get to them.

After the war, our country has suffered multiple economic depressions, and famines due to the incompetence of our liberally named Communist Party. Granted the South Vietnam government wasn't any better, but what the U.S wanted for Vietnam was for the best.  \n  \nI understand that, technically the US did not wage war with our people, but stood against the spread of communism in Asia, and with our strategic location, a battle surely followed. The US did not deliberately invaded our country. And look at what they did to the world. ~~Defeated the Nazis and fascist countries~~, uplifted South Korea, Japan (which were both smaller and less resourceful than my country) to their respectable position on the world map today. And what had the sole communist party in my country done? Nothing but left our people in the struggle of a third-world country. And China is still brazenly harassing our borders and seas to this very day, just because our army is incapable of standing up for themselves.  \n  \n~~Please tell me if I was wrong and why the North won was a good idea.~~  \n  \nFirst Reply:\n1) Do you know how brutal, corrupt, and undemocratic South Vietnam is? Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m isn't democratically elected, instead he was assumed the presidency by the American to a country largely make up by the remnant of French imperialism (a puppet state). He's also not popular either, remember Vietnam supposed to be unified in 1954 after \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7, and supposed to hold democratic election in 1956 as a result of the Geneva Accord... Guess who would have won that if it is actually held? That's right, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh had the overwhelming support of the nation. Not because he is a communist/socialist figure, but rather a NATIONALIST one\n\nBack to the period of Diem's rule, the government is largely consist of his family members holding key positions (gia d\u00ecnh tr). Also, there are huge oppression toward the Bhuddism commnunity, led to the self-immolation of some certain Bhuddist monk that you should know. Also, there were many wrongful incarceration/execution of people who are suspected to be Communists or spy from the North. Likewise, villagers are force to move into camps/fortresses to avert any uprising... These policies causing lots of oppositions from the people and thus Diem was murdered.. What happened after that was a two-year spans of political instability, and the country couldn't even control itself... Hence, the Americans forces had to involve, which coincide with Nguyen Van Thieu's rule (and he's merely a puppet in a gov't whose policies were largely dictated by the Americans)...\n\nMy point is that how could a government that unstable could actually controlled Vietnam. Lacking of integrity from the interior and strength to cope with outside forces... The result of the War largely reflects the nature of South Vietnam, a mere puppet state which shouldn't be there at first place \n\n2) You think that the American wanted the best for us? Well, do you understand the nature of the Cold War, a global-scale tension which Vietnam was reluctantly dragged into. Most Vietnamese couldn't associated their War within the Cold War concept, virtually because we're from the \"hottest\" spot, which overshadowed the Cold War itself. My point is the US had their own interest to stop the power of the USSR, thus they called \"spread of Communism\", and they went radical about it. Many democratic elected  socialist leaders were overthrow by the US army and replaced by anti-communism despot, most notably in [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) or [Guatemala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat). (Different circumstance but don't forget [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Chung-hee)). Vietnam War shared the same nature with these but much more intensify because of the [Domino Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_theory)\n\n3) About OP &amp; Vietnam: ~~You're part of the bandwagon who want to gaze war with China to demand the islands back. How ignorance you are!~~ This is not XII century when you could easily declare war upon one another. If we do attack China, not will we suffer their reprimand, but will receive criticism around the world. Diplomacy is the key, stronger collaboration between ASEAN and the US forces would keep the Chinese in the current place. \n\nI can't believe you despise the Vietnamese gov't because of Communism. It's a fail economic model that Vietnam got rid of in 1986. The party retain the name for historical reason, and more importantly, its nature is NATIONALIST, and a political platform for all people. [One-party system is totally democratic if you keep different opinions among its memebers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOsjSKKPWMc). If you think multi-party platform could work in Vietnam, then consider what happen in South Vietnam during the war, and how they set up a dictatorship after. \n\nYou should remember that Vietnam is war-free in 1989, so its economy has short time to recover and develop. Compare Vietnam economy to Korea's and Japan's one disregard circumstances is just compare apple to orange. Remember that the war would be completely averted in [1945](http://www.archives.gov/historical-docs/todays-doc/?dod-date=228) and [1954](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conference_%281954%29).

So I don't think you're alone, but I think perhaps you're assuming that had the American backed South won, these problems would be fixed. I know you said the North was corrupt, but the South was every bit as corrupt. They probably wouldn't have been able to support the economy any better, and depressions and famine may have ensued anyway, albeit they may get support from the US. Remember that a significant number of Vietcong in the South were southerners who were disillusioned with the corruption of the government. So they in effect fueled quite a lot of backlash against themselves. I'd also point out that the government was rather unstable, as seen in the assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem. If there was that much turnover, there could potentially be wars in the future over other rival factions or even communist resurgence or a probable and continual insurgency. So there's a significant potential that more Vietnamese would die in the coming years than the already horrible toll paid. Also, if the DRVN won the war, I highly doubt they'd be able to solve the border dispute between Vietnam and China considering those countries have been at odds for centuries if I'm not mistaken. My point here is that unfortunately the choice between a good government and a bad government appears to have been an illusion, and while unfortunately the current government isn't good, I guess you might say it's \"the devil you know\", considering things could have gone worse."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I would find this argument much more convincing if Uber weren't exempt from almost every rule and regulation by which the TLC governs traditional taxi services, on dubious legal grounds.  Yellow (and green) cabs in NYC must comply with many rules, including car safety inspections, emissions checks and other environmental regulations, and driver background checks.  Whether you agree with these rules or not (and I certainly have some questions about some of them), the fact remains that they are expensive to follow and that cost is of course passed on to the consumer by the cabs.  \n\n\nUber is not competing in a free market at all, in the sense of operating more efficiently to offer a lower price-- they're just gouging their competition by flouting the law.  If Uber (or anyone else) disagrees with these laws (such as the regulation of fares), they can of course use the political process to try to get them changed, but in that case they should be changed for regular cabs also.  There should never be a situation where there is one set of rules and regulations for regular cabs and a separate set for Uber.  \n\n\nUber is not and should not be above the law, no matter how cool and \"disruptive\" they might think they are.\n\n\n**TO BE CLEAR: I am not arguing for or against any particular regulation.**  My argument is that, whatever the level of regulation you favor, Uber and yellow/green cabs should be held to the same standard.\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nTaxi's ability to be hailed from the street is what usually separates them from other services, such as, black car services.

This cap does nothing except produce economic rents for those who own medallions, and is fundamentally unfair.\n\nVehicles which have passed safety inspections, have licensed drivers, and have accurate fare systems should be allowed to pick up passengers.  Right now they are not unless they have a special permit from the government that you can't get because they stopped issuing new ones in the 30s.\n\nThe medallion system is stupid and Uber is morally right to flout it.

The amount of debris relative to the size of the area is not that much... not even taking into account that it isn't happening on a plane but in 3-D space.\n\nWhy is this wrong with this? I guess this doesn't take into account gravity (the gravitational pull of a satellite may be substantial at orbit - making collision highly likely). Or perhaps the scale of damage even a bolt could have.. but these to me seem so remote....\n\nOver the next, 20 years we will launch a lot more satellites - but only/maybe then they may become an issue - but at the present time it's like talking about not getting in your car because you are worried about drunk drivers - it may be acceptable but it is not rational\n\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nThere are a few things which are concerning with orbital debris.\n\nFirst though, a little primer on orbital mechanics.\n\nYour velocity and your orbit are the same thing.  If you give me the velocity (that is speed+direction) and location of a spacecraft at a single point, I can tell you its orbital path.^1\n\nSecond, there are certain orbital \"sweet spots\" which are beneficial for various reasons.  One of the most beneficial (and most crowded) is geostationary orbit.  Geostationary orbit is where your orbit matches Earth's rotation such that the satellite appears to always be at the same place in the sky.  It's great for communication satellites.\n\nGeostationary orbit is a single circular ring around Earth.  It's at the equator, about 36000 km from Earth's surface.  It's not a plane, or a 3-dimensional space, it's a single line.\n\nOk, so why is this a concern:\n\nFirst, things in orbit move very, very fast.  When I said that velocity tells me your orbit, I didn't give an idea of how fast these velocities are.  The Space Station for instance is travelling at about 27,600 kph relative to Earth's surface.  That's crazy fast.  If you were listening to the song [about walking 1000 miles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ4Ib-7fJqY) on the ISS, you would have traveled a thousand miles by the end.^2\n\nAt those speeds, an impact is absolutely devastating.  We're talking multiple times faster than speeding bullets.  \n\nAlso, orbits need constant maintenance.  Due to the gravity of the Sun and Moon, anything in orbit is constantly being tugged around and pushed to different orbital paths.  This means that debris which can no longer be controlled will not just stay put, but possibly come intersect with orbits we want to use.\n\nSatellites in active use are tweaking their orbits constantly to keep where they need to be.  When they get to the end of their useful life, they're generally either sent to burn up in Earth's atmosphere, or to a very high orbit to be out of the way.\n\nThe nightmare scenario is a single impact between two larger objects causing a lot of uncontrolled debris though.  It would be too small to see where it is, or predict where it will go, but yes, a bolt or a scrap of solar panel can completely wreck a large spacecraft.  \n\n\n\n-----\n\n^1 I'll probably use a computer though because I'm lazy.  \n\n^2 [Source](https://what-if.xkcd.com/58/)\nSecond Reply:\nI think the issue is that 1) Satellites orbit at a specific altitude, and 2) space debris covers a much larger area/volume than you'd expect, seeing as tiny particles whizzing around at incredible speeds can do a lot of damage to delicate instruments.\n\nCheck out [this](http://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2012/oct/04/astronomy-space) article for more information. It uses the ISS as an example; the ISS has had to make maneuvers to dodge space debris. When objects in space are hit by debris, they themselves shatter into debris, causing a chain reaction. It is very feasible that with enough debris in a particular altitude zone above our planet, we will no longer be able to launch rockets/probes to other planets, and we will have much less room for satellites (assuming they can only orbit at specific heights)."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Compared to O'Malley's page, Sanders has a lot of work to do.\"\n\nYou hear these complaints all. The. Time. In newspapers, on blogs, on TV news, in debates, etc. Candidate X offers no details, they're evasive in answering questions, they're canny, they give bland lip service to a problem and make happy talk about solutions, but they never *actually say what it is they're going to do if elected*. It's like the default setting of oppo research, a ready-made criticism to hurl at a candidate if you don't have any meatier, muddier dirt to fling their way. \n\nBut the thing is, there are very good reasons for candidates to be evasive. For one thing, if they were to offer actual policy details during a campaign, then they'd spend the entire rest of the campaign defending and arguing about those details. If someone found an error or mistake or potential pitfall, they might have to revise their plan -- revise a policy that doesn't even exist yet! Political opponents hire specialists in opposition research, and the more material those specialists have, the more they'll be able to distract and distort your candidate's plan in order to make them look bad. Giving them an entire piece of draft legislation, or an entire detailed budget document showing cuts and spending, etc. would be like a godsend to the oppo research people. And all for what? For an imaginary policy that doesn't even exist yet. No candidate in their right mind would open up so many vulnerabilities all for the sake of a policy that doesn't even exist outside of the candidate's website. \n\nSecondly, no political candidate is running for the office of dictator. Whether someone is running for President, Senate, Congress, Governor, state legislator, dog catcher, etc., the important thing to remember is that politicians have to work with other politicians, and agencies, bureaucracies, other constituents, etc. They have to work with other people to get anything accomplished. So if you get elected to office with a complete, massively detailed economic stimulus package combined with spending cuts and tax cuts, don't expect every other member of Congress to just roll over and rubber stamp your policy. Politics isn't beanbag, and you'd get crucified by the players in Washington (or any other capital). Oh, you promised you were going to cut the F-22 fighter? Well guess what, that's going to throw 60,000 people out of work in my district. And you want me to just vote for it because *your* supporters voted for you? How about f--k you?\" \n\nIf you got elected with a detailed policy proposal, everyone in the government responsible for putting your policy into motion would have you over a barrel. Every change they make to your policy would threaten to make you a \"liar,\" a judas, a traitor, etc. to the people who supported you, as well of course as your political enemies. Your policy details would become a millstone around your neck and a gun to your head. Your friends and enemies alike would be able to use all of your detailed promises on the campaign trail in order to wrap you around their fingers.\n\nSo that's my view: politicians would be insane to offer detailed policy answers to any given question, and they are wise to stick to vague generalities, advertising language, happy talk, etc. Can you think of a good reason for politicians to spell out their promises in detail? \n\n\n\nFirst Reply:\n&gt; \"So and so says he's going to reduce the budget, but so far he hasn't offered any specifics.\"\n\nThe problem here is that without details, these promises don't mean anything.  Anyone with half a brain can figure out how to reduce the budget (simply by cutting services). But a candidate who wants to reduce the budget by cutting military spending is a much different candidate than one who wants to reduce the budget by cutting education spending.\n\nLook, everyone wants lower taxes.  Pretty much every candidate I've ever seen in my entire life has promised to lower taxes in some way.  Frankly, I'm not interested in such a meaningless promise.   Unless you can explain, on at least a basic level, how you plan on lowering my taxes, I can't take you seriously.  Maybe you want to cut the military, maybe you want to cut education, maybe you want to raise the corporate taxes.  Until you give me some indication on how you plan on doing it, and at least some basic figures to back them up, I can't tell if I support you as a candidate or not.\n\nFor me, I want to understand the basic tenets of a politician's plan.  I'm not expecting them to necessarily implement it exactly as presented, but at least I understand the road map they are working from.\nSecond Reply:\nThe government is run on taxes from the people. The people essentially loan them the money in order for the government to operate and provide services back to the people. \n\nCan you imagine if I walked into the bank today to get a loan for a new business venture and I didn't give any details on how I planned on getting the business to work, what I would do if certain aspects failed, how I planned on paying that money back to the people (the equivalent of the government putting money back into social services)? I'd be laughed out of the bank.\n\n If professional financial institutions don't give out money without a clear plan and direction, why should the people under a government expect any less?"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I honestly wouldn't care if they abolished all public decency laws and everyone walked around naked. However, that doesn't change the fact that the laws exist, and are the basis of my argument. For the people who do get uncomfortable around nude breasts, a single father with his adolescent daughter, or a mother with a teenage son, or even some old stick in the mud curmudgeon, I don't think it's too much to ask to handle such things in private. Whether pumping milk, or nursing at home, there are ways of handling these things. No one else is obligated to accommodate \npublic nudity. If it's not \"convenient\" for them, that's all part of the sacrifice of parenthood.\n__\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nWhat is indecent about it?\n\nYou say you're basing your view on the law, but [\"Twenty-nine states exempt breastfeeding from public indecency laws.\"](http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/breastfeeding-state-laws.aspx) So in over 50% of the US, breast feeding is *not* considered \"indecent exposure.\" \n\nDoes your CMV only apply to the 21 states that don't have the exemption? Even in those states: \"Forty-nine states have laws that specifically allow women to breastfeed in any public or private location.\" So really if you're saying \"I don't believe this is indecent but there are laws against indecent exposure so breastfeeding should be banned along with anything else in those laws\" that doesn't apply because the laws specifically exempt breast feeding from them and breast feeding in public is specifically allowed in all but one state. \nSecond Reply:\nLet's take the first part of the California Indecent exposure law:\n\n&gt;Every person who willfully and lewdly, either:\n\n\n&gt;    1. Exposes his person, or the private parts thereof, in any\npublic place, or in any place where there are present other persons\nto be offended or annoyed thereby; or,\n\nPay careful attention to the first sentence, because it's the most important. Breastfeeding is not typically done \"lewdly\". Basically every indecent exposure law has this kind of requirement.\n\nA woman that \"breastfed\" in the manner of a striptease in public might well be violating indecent exposure laws. Doing so normally is not, because it's not lewd. "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

You can't legally force someone to allow themselves and their families to die/suffer badly even if it means saving others lives\n\nobligatory \"obligatory wow gold?\" \n\nFirst Reply:\nSo I'm going to answer this in three aspects - \n\nFirst, legally. The Germans surrendered unconditionally. That means the Allies were free to try the Germans in whatever manner the Allies desired. The ground rules for the Nurember trials wer set down in the [London Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Charter), which prohibited \"I was only following orders\" as a defense. (The Germans decided to use it as their defense anyway). I'd also like to point out that the British prosecutor at Nuremberg, Hartley Shawcross, went to great lengths to show that the trials were not a case of post hoc justice. That is, the Germans on trial at Nuremberg were guilty of many crimes under both German and international law predating the War. \n\nSecond, as other people have said, the Germans on trial at Nuremberg were the top surviving leaders of Germany. \n\nThird, even if they were not high ranking, \"I was only following orders\" is not a legal defense for soldiers *at any level*, from the lowliest private to the highest ranking general. Soldiers have a duty to disobey illegal orders. \n\n&gt; You can't legally force someone to allow themselves and their families to die/suffer badly even if it means saving others lives\n\nIt's a shitty position to be in, but yes, we absolutely can expect that. If not, nobody would ever be guilty of anything. \nSecond Reply:\nThose put on trial at Nuremberg were not rank and file soldiers; they were high-ranking officers. At that level, they were the ones giving the orders. No one was press-ganged into high-ranking positions in the SS. It was a largely volunteer force that that always had its pick of the most fanatical recruits. No one on trial at Nuremberg held the rank they held against their will."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians, women and children. People with real lives, they were emotional sentient beings; not a statistical number. There had to be some other way than decimating two civilian cities just because we want to end a war quickly.\n\n2.

Army is a different thing. A soldier agrees to the dangers of war and hardship for the protection of their nation. They agree to the fact that they may not return alive from a war. A civilian is a different case, their involvement in a war is very remote. To slaughter innocent civilians just because it will hasten the end of a war seems unjustified. Many people hold the viewpoint that the US bombing was in retaliation of Pearl Harbour. But the Japanese attacked a naval base, they did not bomb a hospital or a school did they?

The argument of USA that the bombing saved more lives compared to Operation Downfall, in the long term, is wrong. Because at least the lives of innocent civilians would have been spared. How do we even know the outcome of Operation Downfall? Moreover Japan was nearly close to surrendering anyway as the Secretary Of War, Henry Louis Stimson agreed: \n\n\u201cJapan had no allies; its navy was almost destroyed; its islands were under a naval blockade; and its cities were undergoing concentrated air attacks.\u201d\n\n\nWe erased two cities and its people from history.

Because at least the lives of innocent civilians would have been spared.\n\nYou have no way of knowing that civilians would have been spared, they could just have easily have been conscripted to fight.\n\nThe Japanese had time and again shown that they *would not* surrender. [That they would candidly fight to the death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Iwo_Jima), in Saipan [civilians killed themselves to avoid capture.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Saipan#Civilian_casualties)\n\n&gt; \u201cJapan had no allies; its navy was almost destroyed; its islands were under a naval blockade; and its cities were undergoing concentrated air attacks.\u201d\n\nAnd despite all that, they still refused to surrender.

You're objection is also rather interesting, because you seem to be hung up on the use of nuclear weapons, when that's not even the worst thing that was done:\n\nHiroshima had 100,000 dead. Nagasaki is around 80,000.\n\nFirebombing of Tokyo, using conventional weapons: 120,000.\n\nBattle of Berlin: 200,000 dead, of which 22,000 were civilians, but where a massive number of the \"soldiers\" were actually conscripted elderly men and young boys.\n\nBattle of Stalingrad: 1,700,000 to 2,000,000 casualties, 40,000 of which were civilians that fell to Luftwaffe air raids *in the first week.*\n\nRape of Nanking: Unknown, on the order of 100,000 to 300,000.\n\nBattle of Okinawa: 120,000 soldiers killed, and 150,000 civilians killed or committed suicide, amounting to 1/4 of the local population. **Bear in mind that this happened immediately prior to the bombings, and were used as a case study as to what could happen if the US invaded the Japanese mainland.**\n\nIn addition, by this point in the war, 20,000 Chinese were dying every week under the Japanese occupation of China, which was still ongoing despite the disastrous nature of the Pacific campaign for Japan.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Operation Downfall was something the US military wanted to avoid, particularly in the wake of Okinawa, where the civilians themselves fought off the US forces or committed mass suicide. The Japanese casualty figures for a mainland invasion were a direct extrapolation of what happened on Okinawa.\n\nAll told, 60,000,000 people (at least) died in World War II. There was significant evidence at the time that an invasion of Japan would have tacked on another 10,000,000 to 15,000,000.\n\nIn addition, the Japanese weren't going to surrender to the terms that the Allies demanded (which themselves were terms that were meant to prevent *another* world war from ever occurring). Ultimately, the bombings were a necessary event that brought an end to probably the most horrific decade our species has ever seen.\n\nThe comparison to 9/11 is also not appropriate, because the bombings were between two countries in a declared state of war, and where actual military targets were identified, and also in an era where civilian casualties were much more acceptable. In all likelihood, if we hadn't nuked the two cities, we would have obliterated them with conventional weapons. 9/11, on the other hand, was a direct attack against a target that was entirely civilian in nature, and against another target that was staffed almost entirely by civilians, and in the modern era where civilian casualties are no longer acceptable (largely due to the horrors of WWII, as well as Vietnam and Korea)."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Part of the reason I joined reddit was because I couldn't share my political opinions anywhere with my name attached.

I go to a ~20% LGBT population High School (from a poll of the Freshman Class) which is incredibly SJW heavy.

If I said I hated the special snowflake attitude that Tumblr a very small portion of actual LGBT people would be upset. They know I support Gay Rights and I'm not a terrible person.

Creating Worker Co-ops\n\nFrankly, I'm not sure what, legally would be required for this - whether the department of labor alone can get this done, or he'd need help from Congress.\n\n* 4.

It's also something that I think has some limitations at the Federal level, since a lot of it is governed at the state.\n\n* 5. Raising the Minimum Wage\n\nDefinitely needs Congress.\n\n* 6. Pay Equity for Women Workers\n\nI believe that there are already laws on the books that he could choose to enforce more vigorously.

Making College Affordable for All\n\nObama has made some strides here.  I don't know how much more he can do without Congress.\n\n* 9. Taking on Wall Street\n\nAgain, there's a lot more stringent enforcement of laws, investigations into trading, etc that the executive branch can do, but they certainly can't \"break up the banks\" without Congress.\n\n* 10.

Interestingly enough, O'Malley began to better flush out his policy on criminal just after he was interrupted by BLM protesters.\n\nForcing his hand in making his stances on racial justice more public and more thorough is the best way to make it a bigger campaign issue, and is the best possible result for the BLM movement at large.\n\nFirst Reply:\nSo, it's hard to actually know for sure how this will all play out. That's actually part of the reason this is bad - no one from any of the groups involved actually knows how this is going to affect his chances at a nomination, which means that at very least, this was reckless.\n\nFrom a tactical point of view, their attack on one of their staunchest supporters potentially removes legitimacy from both them *and* him. If they were truly reasonable, why not just ask him to let them speak? If he was truly a supporter, then why would the group attack him? What else does he purport to support that he actually doesn't?\n\nWhen people don't know his name well enough to instantly associate it with his views, attacks like this make it look like he doesn't support the things that he claims to. Without name recognition, a lot of people won't know that it's a double Shyamalan, and he actually does support civil rights.\n\nIt also makes him appear weak to the general public. Instead of standing firm, he's seen being bullied out by the very interests he supposedly serves. It's easy to say someone bows down to corporate interests or special interests, but it's far more visceral to actually *see* someone back down from a special interest group on a stage in front of a crowd.\nSecond Reply:\nThe problem is that they are getting and will get plenty of backlash for what happened. Sanders is the largest supporter of their movement currently running and they decided to attack his rally. This doesn't paint them in the best of light and marginalizes a lot of the things they are trying to say.\n\nIt would have served them better to attack another candidate with a much lesser position as it would do exactly what you said, force that issue to the front of their campaign. This doesn't work as well for Sanders because we know what his plans are and he has support for it, but this would have been great against Hillary or Trump as they haven't put much focus on the issue and their response to it could sway many people's opinions on their campaigns."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

While that is not a majority by quite a margin, it is a significant amount. Additionally, the popularity and accessibility of tattoos are steadily increasing year by year leading to a greater acceptance amongst a younger crowd. The point here is that because of their widespread nature, tattoos are no longer seen as a sign of rebellion simply because they are so commonplace. \n\nFurthermore, most colleges prefer to accept or deny students based on their applications alone, rather than on interviews. Unlike a job interview, in which personal image can make or break someone\u2019s chances of getting employment, colleges tend to focus more on scholastic and athletic merit, test scores, and lifetime achievements first. Personal image is last on the docket for a school good enough to conduct personal interviews, if even considered at all. \n\nThe previous two points also assume that a college will know about this tattoo, whereas that may not even be the case. In an interview process, there is no chance that the tattoo will be exposed in formal clothing. If the tattoo is exposed after acceptance, then there is no risk of a college retroactively denying admission based on that alone. \nThis third point is also the keystone argument when it comes to employment. For the sake of this argument, I will assume that if an employer knows about any sort of tattoo, it will result in immediately being passed over for the job. This is not consistent with reality and the first two points I make concerning college can be applied to employment as well; tattoos are slowly gaining acceptance in the workforce as the 38% of college students with tattoos graduate and seek employment, and that employers will seek to hire the most qualified candidate with less emphasis placed on personal image. But even discarding these arguments, the possibility of an employer finding out about a tattoo covered by conservative formal clothing in professional situations is nil. \n\n(As some of you may have guessed, I have posted this because I am considering getting a tattoo and want to make an informed decision before doing so. I think I have carefully considered most ways that a tattoo could impact my life, but I wanted to hear some opposing arguments I may have overlooked and figured Reddit could help me out here) \n\n\nFirst Reply:\nWell I can think of a couple of situations where your tattoo could hurt your chances for employment if it is particularly offensive or obscene.\n\nFor one, you sometimes get job offers at weird places. For instance I met a member of an accounting firm (I'm an accounting major) at a baseball game and got offered an interview. There was also a \"meet the firms\" night at a restaurant near campus that I accidentally stumbled upon and met many job prospects there.\nAlso, during my internship, we participated in some outdoor activities after work, like playing kickball with the employees, which helped you meet other people at your firm and helped make a good impression. \n\nMy point is that you can't always rely on covering up a tattoo because sometimes you run into job opportunities or situations unexpectedly. Of course this only really applies if your tattoo is obscene or offensive, because most employers could care less if you have a tattoo as long as it isn't like, on your face or something.\nSecond Reply:\nSome firms don't like their employees having tattoos and they do discriminate. You say you don't think an employer will find out if you dress professionally. So clearly you think a tattoo puts you at a disadvantage. While for most good jobs employers will tend to go for the applicant with the best qualifications and experience. You should remember that usually there is no clear best candidate so a tattoo can make a difference. Its also worth remembering that many companies are involved in events such as charity fund raising or trade exhibitions where you may be required to wear a corporate t-shirt."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Why did they think it helps their cause? \nFirst Reply:\nI am going to start with the caveat that I am not trying to change your overall opinion. I am ONLY trying change your opinion on this particular segment of your reasoning: \"...this was wrong to do, *because he has fought for civil rights before and his economic platform greatly fights for the poor and working class, in which black people are disproportionately represented*.\" I totally agree that Bernie Sanders has one of the better records on civil rights among the candidates who are running. However, that makes him a better target, not a worse one. It would be completely pointless to show up at a Donald Trump rally and say something about Black Lives Matter (or any racial issue). Donald Trump is a clear and overt racist. There is nothing that can be done to make Donald Trump a good candidate on race. Bernie Sanders is a relatively good candidate on race, but many people who have race as the primary political issue that they care about believe that he could be better. By targeting Sanders, who is already a relatively good candidate on race, people can put pressure on him to make race a primary element of his campaign and to refine his opinions on policies regarding racism and social justice. \n\nI don't know what the motivations of these women necessarily were (their message was VERY muddied by a lot of factors) and I don't think their actions were appropriate or helpful at this time. But I think the idea that Bernie Sanders should be free of criticism on racial issues specifically because he has a decent history on them is silly. If people who are not satisfied with his record at this time criticize him and he steps up to the plate, they might have a candidate they actually want to vote for.\nSecond Reply:\nI got lunch today with a group of friends who range from liberals focused issues facing the black community to more radical Black liberation politics. They saw the issue as a matter of access, it was an easy soap box to stand on. You have to understand among some strongly liberal black activists there is a deep mistrust of white led Progressivism. \n\nThe example that Bernie Sanders voted to extradite Assata Shakur was brought up a lot as an example of a progressive politician using civil rights when it's convenient but avoiding more controversial issues that many Black activist see as important. That even when \"meeting half way\" on controversial issues, \"half way\" is  only defined by the White parties. That in the long run even progressive politicians with a good civil rights record still need to be put under pressure so Black Progressive Activism isn't swept to the side.\n\nNot that I agree that it's a good strategy or not but just trying to provide some perspective "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Harry Truman did not know what would have happened if he didn't act. But if this means dropping the bombs \"can't be justified\", then couldn't you say the same if he hadn't dropped the bombs? If he hadn't gave the order, and even more hundreds of thousands of lives were lost, couldn't you just as easily say that his decision to *not* drop the bombs \"can't be justified\" because he didn't know what would happen?\n\nThis is just a fundamental problem of making decisions with limited information. And unfortunately, making those sorts of decisions is literally what the president's job is.\n\nSo the questions I would ask when evaluating such an action involve imagining what other people (myself included) would do in his situation. And to really think about that, you have to put yourself in his position. You are responsible for the lives of millions of Americans. There's a war going on right now with people fighting and dying, and you don't know how its going to end. You don't know how many more of your people are going to fight and die and suffer because of your decisions. And now you are given the opportunity to end it all, but not without a cost. You don't know what will happen, but you kind of just have to do the math based on your best assessment of the situation. I don't think it was a decision that was made lightly. We'll never know if it was \"right\", but I think given the situation at the time, it was reasonable. I don't know if that counts as \"being justified\" to you, but its enough for me not to condemn Harry Truman as a mass murderer."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Often times, the animal is unprovoked. But sometimes an animal's instincts will overtake it, and it will perceive a hiker as a potential threat to either it or its offspring. Whenever an attack on a human happens, park officials from wherever the incident occurred place traps to catch and euthanize the animal.\n\nI don't think that animals that attack hikers should be killed. I love the National Park System, and everything they do, but I just don't think that it is appropriate. The NPS was created for the purpose of being preserved. With that preservation comes the opportunity for us as humans to enjoy them in their uttermost beauty, but that doesn't mean we should start altering them for our convenience. \n\nYes, wild bears can be dangerous. They're BEARS for heaven's sake! But their habitat isn't ours to make our own.

The fact is that we value the life of a human over the life of an animal. When an animal attacks, even if provoked, there is a significant chance that it will attack again. The risk of someone else being harmed or killed is too great to favour the life of that animal.\n\nIf you disagree with this concept, as is your right, you may also want to reconsider where the meat you buy comes from or how the milk you put in your cereal is collected (assuming you are not already a vegan)"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I also don't have the same knee-jerk association of unions and criminal gangs that seems to prevail in discussions I've watched americans have. \n\n---\nThat said, let's move into the meat of the disscusion. \n1) a libertarian economy is not interfered with by the goverment. You want to force people to sign slavery contracts? it's allowed. By the same token however, there are no laws preventing people from forming unions, or those unions taking action to promote the interest of their members. If [the industry can maintain blacklists](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/27/on-the-blacklist-building-firms-secret-information-on-workers), so can the unions. If ]a company decides to close stores to punish union members](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/walmart-accused-of-closing-stores-in-retaliation-for-workers-demanding-better-pay-and-conditions-10193668.html?origin=internalSearch), they run the risk of a rival firm that will work with unions taking the bulk of the sales in that area.\n\nAn antagonistic culture between unions and corporations is not the only option of course, and companies with forms that favour longer term thinking (like walmart, ironically) but also Waitrose in the uk (employee owned) might thrive when others get bogged down in strikes and penalties.\n\n2) unions get more and more effective the larger they get. At heart, they are simply rebalancing the power between a huge corporation and a single worker. The largest unions appeared in nationalised industries - the largest conglomerates of the day. There is a strong selection pressure for small unions themselves to form alliances, or even full unions with each other to increase their bargining power. An ineffective union will loose members to a more effective one and the market will deliver :)\n\n3) the unions themselves suffer the problem of free-riders. People who do not join but benefit from the union driving up minimum working standards and safety. If providing things like out-of-work support costs the union (and thus the corporations they work with) then companies that manage to avoid using union workforce will face a slight advatnage. As such, for strong unions, it is wise to agitate for political change, so that all workplaces have to conform to those same standards, that union type out of work support have to be applied to the entire workforce to prevent more predatory models from gaining a competitive advantage.\nThis also has the advantage, especially at the minimum level of starvation, slavery and loss of limb I've seen, of being a moral thing to do. \n\n4) Some people may have a very high risk tolerance (for whatever reason), and want to do without the safety nets and complain at the cost or inconvenience it puts on them as an employer, employee or as a tax payer. They will continue to complain, but when their individual demands conflict with organised forces, whether as a corporation, worker's union, or an insurance company, they will loose.\nFirst Reply:\nUnions wouldn't exist at all because of free rider and collective action problems.  There are no laws that make unions illegal in right-to-work states in the US, and unions generally can't survive there because not enough people pay dues/join if they aren't forced to do so.   Also, it would be far too risky for an individual employee or small group to attempt to organize a union--the employer would just fire all of the organizers.  The only reason employees can organize unions now is because labor laws prohibit firing workers for union activity.\nSecond Reply:\n&gt; unions get more and more effective the larger they get. At heart, they are simply rebalancing the power between a huge corporation and a single worker. \n\nYour thesis is a little all over the place, but this statement,in particular, is idealistic. Recently, Unions in LA demanded the right to negotiate for less than minimum wage for their workers? Why? Because they are losing members and by having union workers paid less, they would be more likely to have union people hired, and thus, union membership rolls would swell, and unions would earn more money. In other words, they were incentivized to act like the profit making organization they claimed to be fighting against.\n\nIn any case, Libertarians don't have a problem with private sector unions. But they tend to dislike laws that force people to pay union dues, even if those said people don't feel like the union is representing them in any meaningful way."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I believe that it is not or that if it is then it is necessary.  This \" forcing ideals on others\" is an argument I hear often and I just want to understand it better. I believe that a fetus is a human being. I confess, that is my view, not everyone's view. I believe an abortion is the murder of that child. This is still my view. Not everyone's. United States law entitles all humans to life. Passing legislation opposing abortion is simply following that idea in my way. I am not forcing anyone to agree with me. I am simply making sure the law is followed as I read it. \n\nFor a hypothetical:\n\nIt's 1870 and there is a white who believes that black people are subhuman (not so uncommon at the time). If I say no they are not subhuman. They are human beings and I will prosecute you if you kill them am I \" forcing my ideals on them\" or am I simply protecting what I believe to be human life. And even if I am \"forcing my ideals\" on the man isn't it necessary to do so?  \n\nThe abortion debate is a matter of whether the fetus is indeed entitled to the rights of a living human. It has nothing to do with a group forcing it's ideas on another and such statements are only used to unjustly vilify the pro-life movement.\nFirst Reply:\nI think it is forcing your view on others.  \n\nSometimes that's ok.  For instance, it is my view that violent assault is morally wrong, and I believe it is appropriate to force that belief on others via the government.  So I support the criminalization of violent assault.\n\nThere are things which I think are morally wrong which I do not think should be criminal.  For instance, psychic readers are charlatans who part vulnerable people from their money with bogus and emotionally manipulative parlor tricks.  Being a psychic as a profession is fundamentally evil.\n\nHowever, because the principles of free speech are so important, I am not ok with the idea of using government force to imprison people for doing this act.\n\nYou are holding two views:\n\n1.  Abortion is morally wrong.\n\n2.  Abortion is the type of moral wrong which the government should use force to ban.\n\nIt is possible to hold both of these views, or just number 1, or neither 1 nor 2.  I don't think you could hold 2 but not 1.\n\nIn any case, as to the example you gave about murdering a black person - yes, that is forcing your ideas on others.  But sometimes that's okay.  I won't go after whether or not you should think abortion to be morally wrong.  I won't even go after whether you think it should be banned by law.  But when you say something should be banned by law, you are forcing your ideas onto others, or at least trying to.  \nSecond Reply:\n1. Can you cite an actual law guaranteeing all humans life? \n\n2. Abortion does not end a life, it stops a mass of cells from developing into a person. That's my belief, and I have actual science to back up my belief. Why should YOUR belief supersede mine? Especially when it comes to my right to make choices about MY life and MY body?\n\n3. When you harass women outside of clinics, when you try to pass legislation dictating what they can do with their own bodies, when you try to pass legislation that endangers their lives, you are not just \"forcing your ideals\" on them, you're saying that you know better than them what is right for them. You don't. You're free to believe whatever you want to believe about when a fetus becomes a person, PERSON being the real key here, but you're not free to impose those beliefs on anyone's life but your own, nor should you EVER be free to do so. \n\n4. Unless you're going to care for that unwanted child you want to force some girl to carry in her body, risking her life and health for, for the rest of its life once its born, stop calling yourself \"pro-life\" and admit that you're actually only pro-birth. \n\n5. You ask \"am I forcing my ideals on others or am I simply protecting what I believe to be human life\"? The answer is yes. Both. You may well believe a fetus is a person from conception. You'd be wrong, but you can believe it. But here's the thing: by trying to pass legislation based on that belief, you're forcing your ideals on others. And in this case, that is not okay. \n\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

A lack of serious committments and changes is indicative of this.\n\n\nI believe that we are on the brink of a number of tipping points, if we haven't already passed them:\n\n\n* The melting of the polar ice caps (including rain at polar areas and the landslide effect of snowmelt destabilizing ice sheets causing them to break up plunge into the ocean well before they would even melt) meaning that the sheets which used to reflect sunlight away from the Earth will be gone. Along with that is the albedo flip where as the ice melts and pools of water accumulate on the top of ice sheets, they become a sort of heatsink, absorbing solar energy and causing nearby ice to melt, creating further pools of water. The melting of frozen methane escaping into the atmosphere is a similar effect which will cause another feedback loop as methane is a much more effective greenhouse gas, in orders of magnitude (is it 40x?) above carbon dioxide.\n\n\n* Oceanic acdification threatening to grind not only oxygen production to a virtual standstill but also threatening to destroy the very foundation of oceanic life by removing the ability for the cornerstone of the oceanic foodchain, phytoplankton, to form. If this happens, then the natural cycle of nutrients from the oceans to the waterways back to the land will come to a grinding halt, meaning that the once rich and fertile liminal lands along coastlines will become barren and waterways will end up eutrophying and becoming undrinkable.\n\n\n* The destruction of peat bogs and/or the reduction of the capacity of peat bogs to keep the carbon they contain sequestered.\n\n\n* Runaway forest fires causing feedback loops as the hotter and drier the world gets, the more likely severe forest fires will be which will in turn increase the carbon in the atmosphere.\n\n\n* The potential for rainforest ecosystems to collapse thereby increas\u00ecng atmospheric carbon while ceasing to function as carbon sinks.\n\n\n* Desertification rapidly increasing due to increased temperatures and reduced/erratic rainfall thereby reducing plant life and the ability for ecosystems to absorb carbon dioxide.\n\n\n* The potential for climate change to affect the ability of cloud formation and water vapor to reflect sunlight.\n\n\nBut the biggest factor in all of this, and the one tipping point which we have already passed is this one &amp;mdash; the social tipping point. (Granted this is hypothetical and I admit that it's difficult to argue against speculation and prognostication.) \n\nWhat I see as the social tipping point is the part where people stop caring because they feel entirely powerless to affect any change, where governments choose not to act for leverage (political/financial etc.), where governments and corporations choose not to act in order to preserve/increase profits, where the food supply gets put under more pressure due changes in climate (extremes, predictability, rainfall etc.) and so people will be less interested in eating locally or sustainably and more interested in just trying to get enough food, where electricity usage will skyrocket as people try to maintain a comfortable temperature indoors while it's either baking or freezing outside, where we will be faced with increasingly severe humanitarian crises (water shortages, coastal flooding, islands being submerged, famines etc.), where wars over resources will only increase, and the sum of these social feedback loops will cripple our ability to focus on ways to address runaway climate change because we will be dealing with other more urgent issues that cannot be ignored.\n\nThe reason that I believe we have passed this so-called social tipping point is because collectively we have not only failed to halt carbon emissions, but instead we have only been increasing them. If there were hope for us to achieve serious change in order to avert catastrophic climate change, it would be indicated by the countries of the world rallying to make carbon emissions simply plateau. But we can't even do that. So I believe that it's too late for the world to not only stop the increase of carbon emissions, but that it's too late to be able to bring about the dramatic changes in lifestyles/living standards etc. required to avoid either increasing carbon emissions (which is a catastrophe) or simply halting carbon emissions where they are right now (which is a catastrophe).\n\n\nAnd I think that as we have surpassed this social tipping point, it will cause feedback loops in society as well as in the environment which will push us increasingly faster down a path of catastrophic climate change.\n\n\nN.B.: I'm not saying that humans are fundamentally incapable of changing the way they live their lives and their environmental impact. I'm not saying that life will be extinguished altogether, in fact I'm not even saying that humans as a species won't survive, but I'm saying that our societies and our progress almost certainly will not survive. I'm not saying that if we all pulled together and put *everything* we had into averting catastrophic climate change we couldn't stop it. I'm not saying that a revolution that sweeps the globe and changes the fundamental nature of the way society organizes itself around production, consumption, and our relation to the environment couldn't stop this. And I'm not saying that there won't be the potential for some miracle techno-fix that will save everything in the eleventh hour. I'm saying that for us to have anything more than the most infinitesimally small chance that we might be able to save ourselves from climate change somehow that we would need to have already made big strides on this front, and the way that the world is geared means that we are effectively stuck barrelling towards catastrophic climate change in an ever-accelerating manner and that this is demonstrated by us not being able to put the brakes on now, and that's without even trying to put it into reverse (to overstretch the metaphor).\n\nPlease, please change my view.\n\n\n\n[This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3gb6h1/cmv_i_believe_that_it_is_too_late_for_humans_to/ctwso7w) made me realize that big changes could be brought about through a number of ways without the climate getting so bad that we'd need to be neck deep in seawater.\n\n\nI'm still skeptical that we'll be able to pull it off, and I still think that there are a ton of hazards that our current economic system presents us with which we will need to address, but if the circumstances were right (e.g. strong carbon taxes, ratifying the Kyoto treaty, a functional emissions trading market etc.) we really *could* reduce carbon emissions as well as atmospheric carbon in a practical and realistic way that would avert catastrophic climate change.\n\nIn another comment there's a link to a recent /r/science AMA on climate change which addressed how I was buying into alarmism when the reality doesn't actually seem quite so dire when you look at the evidence. At least not yet anyway.\n\n Between those two comments in particular, my view has been changed.\nFirst Reply:\nI don't think catastrophic climate change is for certain. Let me spin you a pollyanna story. I'm not saying it will happen, but it might ....  \n\nThe main environmental problem of our time is the use of fossil fuels (coal, petroleum and natural gas) for *energy*. About half of our energy use is via electricity, coal (the worse offender in terms of global warming) is mainly used for electricity generation. Petroleum is used mainly for transportation. [Chart](https://www.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/field/image/28228_flowcharthighres.png) \n\nFirst, let's assume the cost of wind and solar energy keeps on dropping at [10 to 15% per year](http://cleantechnica.com/2014/04/16/solars-dramatic-cost-fall-may-herald-energy-price-deflation/). On the profit principle alone, companies stop building new fossil fuel electricity generation plants; within the next ten years, they start decommissioning old fossil fuel power plants because it's cheaper to produce using wind and solar. By 2050, almost all the fossil fuel power plants are gone, and no one burns coal (the dirtiest fuel) anymore.  \n\nSecond, suppose the [drop in production costs for lithium-ion batteries accelerates](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/energy_resources_materials/battery_technology_charges_ahead). Over the next 5 years, costs drop by more than half. This makes it cheaper to build a electric car than a petrol-fueled car. Manufacturers and consumers shift over to electric cars en masse, since powering an electric car is so much cheaper than buying petrol for a normal car. The cheaper rechargeable batteries also solve the problem of how to smooth-out the variability of power generation from a wind-and-solar-based grid. Almost everyone has something like a [Tesla Powerwall](http://rt.com/business/256521-tesla-battery-big-business/) hanging in their garage, and hooked up to their mains.\n\nThird, and this is the most iffy, sometime in the next 10 years, all major countries ratify the [Kyoto accord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol) and start taking it seriously. They increase taxes on fossil fuels and impose punitive duties on imports from countries that do not abide by the accord. The cost of using coal and petroleum rise. Because of taxes, coal becomes too expensive to use compared to cheaper alternatives, and coal mines shut down. Petroleum use gradually declines, as companies and consumers find cheaper alternatives. \n\nBy 2050, electricity production no longer uses fossil fuels, and electric cars have largely taken over the roads. Petroleum is mainly used for aviation and shipping. However, increasing taxation and continued progress on biofuels gradually wean these industries from petroleum, and [airlines and ships move over to using biofuels](https://www.iata.org/pressroom/facts_figures/fact_sheets/pages/alt-fuels.aspx). The US military enthusiatically embraces biofuels, as the supply is less vulnerable to disruption. \n\nBy 2060, the world has largely stopped using fosil fuels. Air pollution is a thing of the past, and urban emphysema and lung cancer rates drop. World population [peaks at 8 billion in 2050, and stabilizes.](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/04/130404072923.htm) Increased agricultural productivity, higher GDP, and a stabilizing world population, allows countries to put environmental issues on the fron burner. Climate change increases rainfall over sub-saharan Africa, leading to the greening of the Sahara. In regions where climate change reduced rainfall, [new desalination technologies mitigate the worst effects.](http://e360.yale.edu/feature/new_desalination_technologies_spur_growth_in_recycling_water/2770/) Economic development moves people to urban areas, forests regrow, and mankind becomes carbon-negative for the first time since the industrial revolution. \n\nSecond Reply:\nI do share some of your fears, but you also need to trust in advances in science and engineering to solve many of the problems. Renewable energy is increasingly competitive and a lot of money and research is going into making it the default option. As fossil fuels become more scarce they will become more expensive, which will further tip the equation in favour of renewables. I also believe that increasingly, advances in science that reverse some of the effects of climate change are not beyond our reach.\n\nI also believe that when whole societies start to feel the financial downsides of climate change they will start to act. It's somewhat depressing that people in comfortable Westernised societies aren't moved by melting ice-caps or displaced groups of poor people on the far side of the world, but are when home insurance premiums go up every year because of regular flooding of coastal or low-lying areas. Either way, as I believe that as people start to witness tangible impacts, funding for scientific research will increase, people will accept more legislation to e.g. impose heavy taxes on carbon-heavy things, and so on. \n\nThe bit I can't offer you much comfort over is the effect on marine life - yes, it may be that we are doing untold damage there, and coupled with over-fishing it paints a bleak picture. We are already living through one of the world's great extinctions, which again is largely down to mankind's effect on the planet.\n\nMy great hope is that as the people of the world get to know each other better they will work together better. The internet, primarily, is changing the world for the better - people around the world are connected in ways they never were, and a lot of the traditional divisions between socieities - religions, nationality, language etc - are breaking down, meaning that people are able to come together to make things happen in new ways. I would hope that before too long the whole world can come together to plan how to run this planet properly - we are now powerful enough to destroy ourselves and everything else on this planet if we don't learn some kind of husbandry on a planetary level, so sooner or later we'll have to start working together to shape the planet we want, including how we re-build animal and plant life to a level that benefits mankind.\n\nAnd one final thought to cheer you up: my parents' generation were genuinely terrified of nuclear war, terrified that they would get a 4-minute warning to hide under their desks before they were turned into a ball of fire. So firstly, be grateful that climate change being our biggest threat at least doesn't mean you're going to be turned into a ball of fire in your own home, but also see recent nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation treaties as evidence that mankind, however much we may disagree, is eventually able to recognise such threats and work together to step back from the brink."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

They are major proponents of multiculturalism. They tend to view human social behavior as being socially constructed, and the result of the environment, and are often hostile towards evolutionary psychology. They are more focused on equality of outcome than equality of opportunity. Mainstream feminists fall into this category. They are also more likely to support gun control than the second faction. They have more female members compared to the second faction, and are more likely to be religious.\nExamples of liberals in this faction include: Hillary Clinton, Laci Green, Mike Rugnetta, Trace Dominguez, PZ Myers, and Jen McCreight.\n\nThe second faction is liberal socially and economically, i.e. on abortion, gay marriage, drug liberalization, health care, etc., but is vehemently against the political correctness that the first faction espouses. They are also more averse to multiculturalism than the first faction. They tend to seek biological explanations for human behavior, and are more accepting of evolutionary psychology. They are more focused on equality of opportunity than equality of outcome. Almost all of the members of this faction are atheists. This faction is much more heavily male dominated than the first faction. They are also more likely to support gun rights compared to members of the first faction. They also tend to be more likely to criticize mainstream democrats, such as Barack Obama. Examples of liberals in this faction include: Richard Dawkins, George Carlin, TJ Kirk, Phil Mason, and Carl Benjamin.\nFirst Reply:\nIt sounds like you're describing young liberals on the internet; I recognize the dichotomy you describe, and I would only object that it oversimplifies, but I'd also say you're missing out on a huge portion of liberals:\n\n* Business liberals, who lean towards classic liberalism but still with leftist tendencies; basically center-left business people. A media example is the Economist.\n* Radical leftists, who essentially reject capitalism and are deeply concerned with international issues, viewing most western diplomacy as imperialist or neocolonialist. A media example is Al Jazeera English.\n* Unions and Labor. They draw from a long left-leaning tradition, even though their members are often socially conservative.\n* The silent majority, who mostly favor liberal policies but would be very confused if you talked to them about how you thought evo psych was a defining schism issue in liberal politics.\n\nAlso, I'd point out that evolutionary psychology doesn't make normative prescriptions. For instance, we can accept the evo psych explanation for overconsumption of greasy and sugary foods and still acknowledge that a person's life benefits from a balanced diet. The same applies to any argument from evolutionary psychology.\nSecond Reply:\nI'm not sure how exactly you can distinguish b/w these two \"factions\" based on the considerations you've provided. In my experience, members of the first faction are also socially and economically liberal on matters of abortion, gay marriage, health care, drug liberalization, and they do support multiculturalism. There's so much overlap that your theory doesn't make a whole lot of sense. \n\nIt seems to me that you've just separated them based primarily on gender, not issues. Is that accurate?\n\nAlso, can you provide proof of Obama's atheism? I'd love to see it. He has said that he isn't very religious, but never said that he rejects god. I've never heard it.\n\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I guess you know where I stand. This anti-vax hullabaloo is a bunch of nonsense, and is only present in developed countries. Parents have forgotten what Polio and Rubella do to children, or they wouldn't be so cocksure when denying their children vaccinations. I really don't care how someone raises their child (religion, homeschooling, etc.) but not vaccinating them is plain stupidity. Not malice, just ignorance.\n\nIf you want, I can debunk just about any conspiracy theory you could bring up regarding vaccines, but I don't think it'll be necessary. I'll just deal with the most pernicious point first, ask me for more if you need to. \n\nOne of the biggest reasons for this panic is because people think that vaccines cause autism. They don't. The Lancet paper that started that has been thoroughly debunked. In the meantime, there have been multiple controlled studies that have demonstrated that there is no link b/w vaccines and autism: [Study](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003140) and [an overview with even more available studies](http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p4026.pdf)\nSecond Reply:\nWhat are the main heath concerns that you have with vaccines? Are they worse than the potential medical issues that could arise from people not being vaccinated?\n\nAside from that, there are some people who can't get vaccinated because of certain medical issues. These people rely on heard immunity to protect themselves from the diseases that vaccinations are supposed to prevent. If more people who can get vaccinated don't, it puts those who can't get vaccinated at a greater risk to develop some of the issues that vaccines can prevent. If everyone who can get vaccinated does, it makes it much less likely that these medical issues develop on a large scale. "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Also, the player is less able to aim in small increments. These are non-issues issue at 1080p+ resolutions. \n* UI elements (note especially the map and kill feed in the linked photo) are measured in pixels, and so obscure a HUGE percentage of available vision. This is greatly reduced by having more pixels on the screen.\n* Horizontal FOV (at a given level of distortion) suffers because of the narrower 4:3 aspect ratio.

Not that they can't run it at max settings, but lower resolution would remove precious nanoseconds to any action they performed. As well, in your pic for example, the black border may help the player focus better. I have a cluttered desk,  and sometimes the visual 'busyness' of the desk distracts me  when game play action happens near the edge of the screen. \nSecond Reply:\nThe fovea of your eye is a small part right in the center of your retina and field of vision. You have the clearest vision there, and it slowly deteriorates the farther you get away from there. If you want to have the best vision, you want to concentrate as much important information as possible directly into that spot. A smaller resolution allows for the entire game's field of vision to be in that small part of your eye that sees best."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Often my idea of bad appropriation was the Christianizing of many pagan holidays/traditions by the church to get the pagans of europe joining up with them. \n\nBut my particular case seems a lot different. Yes I am a dominant race type (being white) and I am seriously considering getting a tattoo based upon textiles and patterns used by the Incan Civilization during their peak. Specifically, it would be a sleeve only representing the vibrant colors and geometry that the Inca use. I'm getting it for a few reasons:\n\n* Aesthetically it is very pleasing to me\n\n* I hold a lot of respect for what their civilization accomplished, and would like to \"advertise\" them more through body art\n\n* I may possibly incorporate their symbols for the sun, their main focus of focus worship. Although nonreligious myself, I respect that worshiping the material sun and nature around us is an important trait more of us should take note of. \n\nThis still seems to be textbook cultural appropriation, but is it immoral for me to do so? If I believed this could truly degenerate the Incan culture or offend many rational minds, then there is no way I'd go through with this plan (that just isn't the type of person I am). So, please, change my view if there is something I may be missing here. \n\n\nFirst Reply:\nUsually cultural appropriation is harmful when people choose to utilize, or \"appropriate\", positive elements while ignoring or leaving behind more unpleasant elements. For example, white suburban kids listening to Gansta Rap and wearing do-rags while not having ever (or will ever) experience the specific circumstances that led to those becoming relevant icons in the Black community. Or, more recently, white people wearing headdresses to music festivals (or getting them tattooed on them). Headdresses are, in many Native American cultures, a very sacred and symbolic motif used for specific practices and people. White people who wear them are choosing to ignore the negative parts of Native life and cherry-pick aesthetics. I can go more in depth but that's not the point.\n\nYou are interested in \"appropriating\" from a culture that hasn't had a lot of presence since the 16th century. Though I'm sure you could find an Incan descendent somewhere with an issue there, I doubt you will run into many of them. However, I wanted to address two points:\n\n1. Aesthetics\n\nThis is the primary argument used by people who want to utilize symbols or costumes from other cultures. You understand this is not generally considered a way of \"honoring\" the culture, but picking pieces you think are \"pretty\" with very little regard for their weight or history? Usually, when discussing cultural appropriation in an academic string, this has no weight.\n\n2. \"I may possibly incorporate their symbols for the sun, their main focus of focus worship. Although nonreligious myself, I respect that worshiping the material sun and nature around us is an important trait more of us should take note of.\"\n\nLet's say it wasn't the Incan culture, and it was Hindu. You admit to not being religious, but like certain aspects of their religion, which they probably take very seriously and personally. Do you see how this could be seen as trivializing, white-washing, and \"appropriating\" something that you admittedly don't follow in your own life? It's like saying \"Native Americans worship nature\". \n\n3. I hold a lot of respect for what their civilization accomplished, and would like to \"advertise\" them more through body art\n\nDo you think people don't know about the Incan civilization? Or are you attempting to create solidarity between you and those of Incan descent? Sorry, I don't really understand this point. \nSecond Reply:\nIf you are taking the specific images from a different culture that you have no direct ties to, (Academic curiosity is not a direct tie.) you are claiming those ties. \n\nIf, however, you are inspired by those designs and incorporate some of the aesthetics and styles into your sleeve that is different. Then you are only saying \"Hey, I like this aesthetic style\". \n\nMohawks are a perfect study of this. Yes, there is a Mohawk tribe of Iroquois. But the strip of hair down the center of the head with clean shaven sides is not specific to that culture, or even common within it. It just became synonymous with that tribes name because white people choose to ignore inconvenient things like \"facts\" when creating style and entertainment. \n\nSo now we're stuck with the name along with lumping all of the native tribes in the Americas together as \"Indians\", the Irish drunk stereotype along with countless other examples or inappropriate appropriation and misleading but interesting factoids. \n\nSo for things already in the general public's consciousness.. yeah. There is a whole lot of appropriation that is going on that we actually know is wrong.. but people are loathe to change their terminology etc. and it's generally fairly neutral compared to other issues facing an appropriated community. Neutral in terms of direct impact. Still not necessarily right... but tolerable. Sometimes... it's a really really grey area that anybody can justify whatever they want inside of to be honest. \n\nSo into that broiling frothing mix you want an Incan Tattoo. Not ignorantly, like a kid who hasn't been taught about WW2 saying they want a tattoo like their Jewish great grandmothers. But willfully and knowingly. \n\nIf you are Incan, have Incan Anscestry or had the tattoo offered by an Incan tribe as a sign of repect and thanks... that would be fine. \n\nBut you really just like the look. \n\nSo make the aesthetics your own without co-opting the meaning behind them. Think about the things that are important to you and use your own designs and interpretations to express your life. Where you have been, where you are, and where you are going.

I have torrented rarely for probably 5 years, but I would consider myself on the bottom end of piracy. I subscribe to Netflix, Amazon prime and Spotify, and usually buy my games on steam. Because of these services I never pirate music or games ever, and I usually do not pirate Television or Movies either.\n\nAs an aspiring filmmaker myself, it feels hypocritical to steal someone else's hard work, and so if at all possible I do not do that. I am more than willing to pay 3-5 dollars to rent a movie I want to watch. But this is not the internet we live in. While some movies are available on youtube, itunes and amazon instant for rental, many are either only available to buy or not available at all. On top of that, these services tend to have a charge to rent the \"HD\" version of the film, a practice I believe to be archaic and stupid in an age where everyone has HD monitors and/or TVs. \n\nIn my mind, if there were a service that made a huge selection of films available for a one-time viewing for $5 easily and at full quality -- with options for downloading if need be -- I personally would never pirate films or TV. \n\nHowever, this may not represent the consumer base as a whole and may not be enough to save the companies afraid of the internet. \n\n(WARNING: I AM GOING OFF WHAT I HAVE READ IN THIS SECTION -- I DO NOT HAVE SOURCES FOR MY CLAIMS YET) \n\nWhile Spotify does seem mitigate piracy, it also does not give much money to artists as a rule. But, at the same time, most artists make their money from touring and not from album sales, as the record label would end up taking most of the money from itunes/CD sales anyways. So part of me thinks that in this open age that perhaps it is the companies that should fail, if they cannot accept the internet's existence, freeing the artists to receive more money for sales directly from services such as Spotify and iTunes. The same applies to movies, television (which Netflix has helped a lot, I think) and games (I don't know many people who pirate games, since they are readily available on Steam and GOG.com as a rule) as well.\n\nTL;DR -- I think the companies fighting piracy should give up and try to mitigate it instead -- adapt rather than fight. \n\nWhat do you think? Change my view!\n\nFirst Reply:\nYou are free to make your own show's, music and movies and publish them to youtube for everyone to watch, free of charge. Unlikely to be able to feed yourself.\n\nI suppose you could put advertising, interstitials every X minutes and overlaid ad's and product placement, but ad's only make money if they get impressions.\n\nSo now you need to market your product, damn shame you already starved during the production, but if you didn't, without financing you'd be dead in the water.\n\nThe making of shows is a business where investors expect returns, those investors aren't just financial moguls, they are the people that spent their time making the production, they are actors, directors, production engineers, cinematographers, artists of many senses of the word.\n\nTop talent doesn't just \"work for free\", but you are free to make your own youtube sitcoms, and if you think you can beat the man doing it, I applaud your efforts.\nSecond Reply:\nYou're trading analog dollars for digital pennies though.  \n\nLike these companies built huge businesses up on scarcity.  And music excluded piracy is still too much of a hassle for the average person.     I teach elementary school and like my colleagues would find the process of ripping off tv shows and movies to be far more of a hassle than it's worth, especially in light of the time economy and average broadband speeds where you might have to wait a good bit before you can watch your show.   \n\nIt's a business decision to extract the most money out of a piece of media by subjecting it to windowing.   That is first get the money out of the people who will pay 11 dollars to watch it one time.  Then get the 20 dollars out of the people who will buy the blu-ray.    Then get money from HBO or similar, then eventually it ends up for rent on iTunes&amp; Amazon.   \n\nYes eventually we might end up at a place where a model like the one you suggest makes sense, but today is not that day.   Piracy might eventually be easier and faster, the money graphs may switch where people are making more off of their direct businesses but until that day happens people are still going to want to get as many bites at the apple as they can before they go to the LCD business model.   \n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Hear me out - I'm not here to make a dig at hunters. I don't eat meat myself but I actually believe hunting game as a source of meat is much more ethical than eating mass produced factory farmed animals. Game animals have at least had a natural life without chemicals, genetic engineering and is the ultimate in animal welfare. You can't beat having the life nature dictates. So I'm in conflict with what is actually involved in hunting. \nLets take an example of a hunting a deer. A healthy meat with a plentiful population to chose from. So you go out into its habitat, learn its habits, track it and then finally you see it. Quietly in its happily eating some food. Minding its own business. Full of life and so majestic in its natural habitat. This stunning beast is a pleasure to see.  I believe many hunters genuinely have a lot of respect for the animals they hunt. But then full of all that respect BOOM! They take its life. Just like that. All that effort to understand it, follow it and watch it they extinguished  in a second.  Cold hard logic can indeed justify why the animal is killed but deep down the pleasure hunters feel when they've killed an animal doesn't make sense to me. \nFirst Reply:\nI'm just starting out hunting, and I've taken some small game, but I don't do it just to see something die, and I hope I never do. I do it because I like the food, I like being outdoors, I like knowing my meat was harvested as painlessly as possible, and in the U.S. it helps prevent habitat destruction by both funding conservation and managing populations that have had their natural predators removed by human intrusion and poor hunting practices prior to the current system. I want future generations to see whitetail deer, water fowl, and wild turkeys, and  can help preserve them by hunting responsibly, while getting some free range organic food out of it. \nEdit: I want to add that when I pull the trigger, I feel a mix of emotions. Seeing something die by your own hands is unpleasant, and I don't get a single bit of pleasure for the act of killing. At the same time, the feeling of accomplishment after spending hours scouting and tracking is a huge rush. I know a lot of hunters say a prayer over their kill, and while I am not religious, I do pause to reflect and respect an animal's passing\nSecond Reply:\nI applaud deer hunters in my area because we have way too many deer. Car/deer interactions are high in my former state. I know. I've hit one. Deer populations are out of wack because we removed alpha predators. There are too many of them and the health of the herd is affected. \n\nHunters either kill deer or deer populations grow to the point where they starve to death. Nature doesn't really mess around. \n\nI would much rather a deer died from a clean bullet wound than from a slow death of starvation or the aftermath of a car strike. "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

We should all be able to overcome our issues and not project them unto other people.\n\n\n\nThank you all! :)\n\n----\n\nIn 7th and 8th grade I was a snob. This was probably because I am the youngest of five siblings and was fairly better looking than my classmates (before the acne, bad eyesight and crooked teeth kicked in) among other things. \n\n\nI realised this because of the way my classmates talked about me and treated me and I took the summer of 8th grade to transform into somebody else. I do not recall how exactly I did it but I did. Everybody was surprised, myself included, that the transformation was permanent and genuine.\n\nSadly, I was no longer a bitch but a pushover instead. I was bullied shortly after and had a horrible 8 or so years until I graduated from university. During those 8 or so years, my first love died in a car crash, my parents had a terrible accident leaving my mother unable to walk for a year, of course I picked up smoking, I started to serial-date guys and their treatment to me kept getting progressively worse all while I tried to do well at university because it was getting too expensive for my parents to pay for and getting a job wasn't enough for me to sustain myself.\n\nAdd to the above a religious struggle between myself, my society and my own mother who didn't talk to me for three months while I lived in the same house as her because of my religious and romantic choices (I was dating a black guy), and you get a fairly broken person.\n\nI didn't trust anyone, I was naive, nervous, insecure, a people pleaser, somewhat promiscuous and a smoker. I did things I never thought I'd do and was put in situations I never wanted to be placed in.\n\n\nI was even ashamed of my own psychologist whom I never went back to visit after a couple of sessions because of how fucked up I was.\n\nMy issues seem trivial but these are just the things that I haven't blocked out. My view does apply to individuals who have gone through everything but EXTREME trauma. \n\nMy POINT is: How can I, and so many people who have gone through worse, emerge as functional if not even better people than we were because of what we went through by using our own logic and reasoning, the help of others, counselling and other resources, while others simply act as if life is supposed to be somehow tailored for them and that whatever 'triggers' them by making them actually have to THINK about what they went through should somehow be erased from their lives?\n\n\nTl;dr: Shit happens in life and people should wade through the pile of crap and come out as functional human beings via their own logic rather than project their issues unto others and claim that whatever 'triggers' them to think about their problems must somehow be banished or banned. \n\n\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nI have PTSD from severe childhood trauma. \n\nThere are half a hundred things that will get my heart racing and send me into spiralling anxiety, if not outright terror, which are reasonably commonplace. But I don't say to people \"you slamming doors triggers me\". In fact, I don't tell people what tirggers me at all unless they are very close to me or it's necessary because *that's ammunition to use against me* if you want to psychologically terrorize me. I'm not saying that many people would, but it would only take one or two people to make me fall to pieces if they knew about my vulnerability and started using them against me systematically.\n\nWhat does this have to do with trigger warnings? Well, when I'm in a good place I can deal with all sorts of things. But if I've had a bad day/week and I've been struggling to cope with the symptoms of PTSD then reading graphic details of violence, or worse yet, watching movies that have rape scenes or that depict abuse can be enough to tip me over the edge into a pit of terror and despair that it takes weeks to recover from.\n\nI can keep my shit together more or less. I can use what resources I have to bring myself down from the extremes. But if I find myself indavertantly exposed to stuff that is retraumatizing it can really mess with me if I'm not prepared for it or I'm not in a good place. I'm not saying that people can't say or do as they like, or that media has to censor itself just for my sake. All I want to know is whether or not what I'm about to be exposed to may cause me to relive trauma. It doesn't have to be 100%. Just the most graphic and extreme stuff. Why? So I can make an informed choice on whether or not I can deal with whatever it is before I'm exposed to it and so I can take responsibility for my own reactions.\nSecond Reply:\nSome people are stronger than others, some trauma happens very quickly, like a rape, other stuff like abuse over years takes years. \n\nTriggers are real, but VERY rare, it usually happens after a rape, a war or after a childhood abuse. Trigger warnings don't really harm anyone, they are just a courtesy, we have them for everything. Movies (R, PG-13, PG, G, NC-17. And it always says why) video games (M, T, E10, E, EC, AO, and it always says why) TV (TVMA, TV14, TVPG, Y7, Y, G) and it always says why. \n\nThey are a courtesy, obviously they should be there so people don't accidentally take their kids to see a dirty movie. When it comes to trauma triggers, most therapists help people either get adjusted or identify triggers, but an extra warning never hurts.\n\n**Edit: \"Stronger\" was a bad choice of words, some people are less effected.**"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The speed limit in the most used highway where I live is 70. I usually go at around that speed (give or take 3-5 miles). Now, I have noticed that an alarming amount of people that are driving behind me get impatient and just speed on ahead of me (which is perfect, if there is no danger of crashing). I usually notice that these people are going at at *least* 90+ mph, and they don't slow down.\n\nThis just angers me so much, I feel like I'm constantly being put at risk by boneheads that are too impatient to drive on the speed limit.\n\nI commented this to a lot of friends and most of them tell me that I'm wrong, because \"nobody follows the speed limit\", and I'm going too slow. They say it's perfectly fine to drive at 90+ miles on a highway which indicates to drive at 20 miles less. I don't know anymore. Am I wrong? Should I start speeding too?\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nTraffic is generally safer when going slower. Traffic is also generally safer when there is little variance in speed, ie everyone is going about the same speed.\n\nIt seems intuitive to me that a larger variance in speed of different drivers would contribute to more accidents than a slower speed. Ie, if everyone was going 90 +/-5, there would be less accidents than 80 +/- 15. I have no stats to back that up and I very well might be wrong, but from my experience I believe this to be the case.\n\nIf that is correct, in order for the population to have the safest possible driving, people should drive as close to the average as possible. Driving too far under will cause more accidents. If that average happened to be high, as it seems in your case, you might be able to reduce variance and in effect reduce accidents by going faster.\nSecond Reply:\nDepends on the type of freeway really. In some places I'd be wary of cutting over to the leftmost lane to pass some people if it is 3+ lanes. In my anecdotal experience that's when you have to watch out for those guys the most. In all cases, I find it best to let the fastest drivers pass you, since (as others have noted) it is the safest thing to do as it deters tailgating and it reduces the chance you'll get pulled over for speeding yourself (even if you are already going well over)."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I believe that some of the social welfare programs in the United States could be reformed to give jobs, education, and training to low-to-none income individuals and families as opposed to handing out checks. I believe that this would be beneficial because:\n\n1. Living off a free welfare check sometimes decreases an individual's drive to work and better themselves; and by extension to increase their standard of living\n\n2. Providing job training and/or an education to underprivileged individuals allows for the betterment of the individual - increasing ambition, social ability, financial stability, and other benefits\n\n3. Providing job training and/or an education to underprivileged individuals allows for the betterment of the society - increasing the education of American society as a whole, decreasing unemployment and crime rates\n\n4. I believe that there is enough money (read: safety net programs budget in the US; http://www.cbpp.org/research/policy-basics-where-do-our-federal-tax-dollars-go) that will be freed up in order to allow this reform\n\n\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nLiterally no one is going to disagree that programs that give people jobs will be better at finding people jobs than programs which don't focus on finding people jobs. It's a tautology. The reason we have safety net programs is because we want the right people in the right jobs.\n\nThe types of jobs that publicize position vacancies to programs that focus on job placement are usually minimum wage and temp positions, bottom of the barrel type jobs where the employer isn't concerned so much with finding the right person for the position as a body to fill a hole.\n\nIf an accomplished accountant has a really unfortunate layoff when his company goes belly up, and can't find a comparable job for some time, it makes a hell of a lot more sense to give him a little cash to hold him over until he does find an equivalent position than to place him in meal assembly at Burger King where his skills will be completely wasted. \n\nAlso, if safety net programs were defunded to provide for job placement and education programs, what would the really unfortunate people who don't have a cent to there name do to feed and house themselves and their families while attending daily classes or waiting for job placement?\nSecond Reply:\nThere's a perception that you can live \"comfortably\" on welfare, which would naturally decrease someone's drive to work.  It's really not true.  The welfare state as it exists now makes it incredibly difficult to live a satisfying life without a source of income.\n\nI'll give you an example.  Let's say you're a single person who is unable to work consistently because of a mental illness; not something that totally cripples you and makes you unable to leave the house every day, but something that causes you to suffer months-long bouts of depression or anxiety that make holding down a long-term job or building a career impossible.  Your resume is really bad because you've tried and failed to hold down a job for several years, which means it's hard for you to find work outside of a place like WalMart that will hire anyone with a pulse.\n\nSo, you apply for \"welfare.\"  It varies a bit based on where you are, but what you can expect to get if you apply for the whole package is:  \n- Food stamps, on the order of about $100 a month that can only be spent on unprepared food  \n- Housing assistance, which means cheaper rent (not no rent) if you agree to live in a neighborhood where people get robbed and assaulted on a regular basis and everyone is selling drugs  \n- Medical insurance, which will make your doctor's visits free but which will refuse to cover most non-generic prescriptions (remember, you're dealing with a mental illness that could kill you if you aren't medicated)  \n- Cash assistance, which is exceedingly difficult to qualify for and can go as high as $200 in some states, but averages more like $85.  Usually these require that you're on SSI to get.  \n\nYou're disabled, so you can also apply for Social Security Disability Insurance, right?  Well, you can, but you'll get denied.  You have to pay a certain amount into Social Security to qualify for the disability insurance, and if you've been mentally ill since you were a teenager there's no way you've held down a job that long.  What you qualify for is SSI.  SSI tops out at roughly $750 a month, and they will reduce that dollar for dollar with any unearned income you get, like if, say, your parents are allowing you to live rent free or buying you the occasional fridge full of groceries.  If you do manage to temporarily find work, that amount will be reduced by fifty cents for every dollar you earn, after a couple of small deductions.\n\nAdd on to this that every single one of these programs is separate.  There is no monolithic \"welfare.\"  These guys, and the food shelf, and any charity you work with will all want records and updates and details on your life.  If you do decide to make a try of un-fucking your life and get work, you will have to obtain and send out a half-dozen copies of your pay stubs to a half-dozen different offices, and a three-paycheck month or a single bonus check can devastate you.  These benefits take months to apply for, and if you lose them because you made too much money in one thirty-day period or saved up more than two grand (which can easily be wiped out by a single car repair bill) it can take as much as 90 days to get your benefits back.  During that time your already low income is cut.  You're eating one meal a day, you're letting your bills pile up, you're calling in favors and borrowing money from people who are already sick of you asking them for things.  Your friendships and family relationships get strained.  Your stepmother makes snide comments about how some people have to work for a living every time she sees you.  You get really stressed out and start having panic attacks, and lose your job because you're so stressed out from not eating.\n\nThen the cycle starts all over again.\n\nNobody would ever choose to live like that.  You get no luxuries, you get no rest.  People who can't get out of the system aren't rejoicing because they get a free ride.  They're spending every day staring at people driving new cars, going out to eat and buying each other video game consoles for Christmas, and going crazy with envy.  They want that.  They want kids, they want a career, they want a real life.  But they can never have it.\n\nIf they could do real work for a real wage, they would do it."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

If we're using the usual justification of animal rights - they can feel pain/have a life - then letting them lead a safe and happy life in captivity seems to be more moral than the dangers of the wild.\n\n* This is a less quantifiable good, but zoos let citizens see animals which they otherwise not, leading them to consider them - and the environment - when creating/voting on policies.\n\nWhile I guess the best way to C my V would be to provide overwhelming evidence that zoos provide lower quality of life for the animals than life in the wild and that there are more effective means of conserving/promoting endanger species, I'm mostly interested in values/premises I haven't considered. \n\nChange my view! :)\n\nFirst Reply:\nI actually agree with you, and could add many more reasons why zoos can be ethical, but that's not the point here so :\n\n  - endangered animals can be cared for : It's true but it's only a very small portions of endangered animals that the public find cute or know about that will be protected this way. The reasons why some animals are protected in the wild or in a zoo are wildly irrational.\n\n  - Most of these animals are 'exotic' and you concern has very little chance of changing things in these animals former countries. Also there are many other ways to attract attention to these animals than enslave them and put them in a cage. We actually did that at the World Expo in Brussels with Congolese tribesmen. And I can conclusively confirm that it wasn't really conductive to intercultural understanding and enlightenment. It was another freak show, and the exploitation of living beings for financial purposes.\n\nSo yes, zoo can be ethical but it has never been their vocation. They are not actual non-profit organizations.\nSecond Reply:\n&gt;  The animals - especially endangered ones - can be cared for\n\nThis is true and useful.  But only a tiny percentage of animals in zoos are endangered.  Also, *keeping them in zoos* renders them unable to live in the wild.  A far more effective, long term method of preserving endangered species is to protect the wildlife in which they live.\n\n&gt; either to preserve the species or ultimately release into the wild. \n\nAnimals who are born, raised or otherwise spend long periods of time in zoos are no longer able to survive in the wild.  It's actually considered immoral to release them into the wild because they will die long before their ability to mate.  \n\n\n&gt; zoos let citizens see animals which they otherwise not, leading them to consider them - and the environment - when creating/voting on policies.\n\n\nIt is true that zoos bring animals closer to humans, but there isn't any evidence to show that humans are more caring of the wildlife environment as a result.  \n\n\n\nThough, mostly zoo life for animals is a lot like prison life for humans.  No one would argue that a human in prison is alive.  Or that it's not cared for.  Humans have food, shelter, entertainment and social structure.  But all of the things that make life worth living are gone.  The ability to build a family.  The option to find a mate.  The ability to build the things in our lives which we each assign value to.  Animals are not so different.  They might mate with another because they are incited to.  But they often have ideas of who they like or don't.  They cannot hunt their food in spite of an evolutionary drive to do so.  Also, often, the topic of animal depression is discussed in zoos where it would be nearly nonexistant in the wild.\n\nIt is the guarantee of *life* which is more than the wild offers.

Sexuality is strongly tied to identity.  \n\nImagine all of the cues that society gives a person who is sexual sexual. Everything from who they are having sex with (IE disparities in attractiveness, age, race, etc) is scrutinized.  Also the kinds of sex that you are open about having strictly helps to categorize you somewhere in the system.  Almost everything about sex is in some public sense taboo.  \n\nEven without sex, there's a lot of bonding among men and women (separately or together) regarding sexuality.  Just looking at an attractive person passing you by and nodding to your buddy.  Or discussing events, celebrations or just making up.  Sex is a common topic of discussion.\n\nThen there's the media.  Sexuality drives us to buy everything from beer to gym memberships.  It's a tool which is used because it works.  If it didn't work on you, you would find it more than just superfluous, it would be frustrating to be exposed to it regularly.\n\n\nIt is a factor of identity which is deeply ingrained in society and ubiquitous in daily life.  If a person does not feel a sex drive, everything from social bonding, to reactions to commercials to meeting social expectations would be impacted.\nSecond Reply:\nBeing asexual is definitely not a choice. While some kids may \"try on\" asexuality just like some kids experiment with bisexual or gay relationships in their early years, it's something that wears on you over time. If there is one solid expectation of you in society, it's that everyone wants to get laid. Sex is such an integral part of our relationships and our perceived value in relationships. Can you think of the last time you got aroused? Can you imagine *never* having been aroused? Isn't it such a strange thought?\n\nThat's how many asexuals feel about the idea of sexual attraction. It's *strange* and foreign. And because we have that powerful disconnect from something which is a strong underlying motivation for the human existence, we're constantly being judged in our relationships--from friendships, to family, and of course our partners as well. \n\nMany asexuals find the right person for them, but the relationship isn't viable because a sexual connection is very important for most people. Even if an asexual is willing to have sex, it's never going to be that powerful \"perfect fit\" sex that partners with good chemistry have. \n\nPeople are extremely uncomfortable at the idea of asexuality. It's definitely not something you can choose.\n\n\n####*personal anecdote follows*\n\n\nI'm 30 years old and asexual. This is a throwaway. I've come to strongly resent my asexuality at this point in my life. Maybe because I spent most of my life trying to ignore it, then trying to fix it, and then ultimately concluding that I am stuck with it.\n\nI've went my entire life and felt no physical attraction to another human being, and it's a really hard concept for a lot of people to understand. I've actually had my mother tell me \"I wish you were gay just so I could understand!\" and that's difficult to hear because that's right up there with being a satanist for her (conservative roots here).\n\nI think there is definitely some people that participate in sexual \"trends\" per se as they are growing older and finding their sexual identity. It's just a natural part of experimenting and finding out about your own body and what you like. Or, maybe people think because they've never been laid that they must clearly be asexual because that seems like a better club to be in than undesirable.\n\nYou really start noticing a gap between you and your friends very quickly, though. There's different shades of asexuality, but I remember so clearly being that weird kid who was completely uninterested in sex but that many people found very attractive. Emotionally, I can connect to other people like anyone else. While I didn't desire sex, I desired to make an emotional connection. So I dated... and dated, and dated. When I was young, I had the excuse that (being in a conservative area), I was waiting for marriage even though I wasn't religious at all. As you can imagine, though, this gets pretty old with young kids wanting to rut everywhere. I got talked about a lot, and not in a good way. \n\nAs an adult, I didn't really have any excuses anymore. I went to see sex therapists, regular therapists, doctors, and anyone else who would listen trying to fix myself. Medically, there's nothing wrong with me.\n\nI stopped dating for a long time. I came to realize that for most other people, sex was a necessary part of a relationship and that they couldn't feel connected without it. That thought was as alien to me as my lack of sexuality was to my boyfriends.\n\nI've been dating my fiance for three years now. Emotionally, we have a really powerful bond but physically I struggle. We do have sex, sometimes. It's tedious and unpleasant for me but I try to make it nice for him. I like cuddling afterwards because I feel like I've endured something that has brought us closer together. We both struggle with my asexuality because it's really hard for a partner to understand that there's nothing they can do to change it but it doesn't mean I don't love him. "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

But again, I don't care if all hate subreddits are banned.

The difference between, say Coontown, and Shitredditsays is light and day, and anyone who says different needs to walk a mile in other peoples shoes. \n\nThe final argument against seems to be that the banning of coontown was for reasons of brigading, and that this was wrong.

Change my view!\nFirst Reply:\nIn a vacuum, getting rid of CoonTown is undeniably a good thing.\n\n*However*, nothing occurs in a vacuum. CoonTown played by reddit's rules. They were obviously on a short leash, but the reddit admins could never find a \"legitimate\" reason to ban them or their associated subs that was in line with the existing policies (i.e. no harassment). Ultimately, they were banned for their content, and that makes quite a few people uncomfortable. In effect, no one knows what the rules concerning acceptable content are anymore. More troublingly, it marks an immense change in reddit's policy; just a few years ago, during spez's last time in charge, he unequivocally stated that content would never be banned. Now? That's quite obviously changed.\n\nMost redditors concerned with speech issues are on a hair-trigger at the moment. They're not going to leave just because CoonTown was banned, but the way in which they were banned is making quite a few of us uncomfortable about the future of this site.\n\nreddit is dead. Long live Reddit.\nSecond Reply:\nI don't want to change your mind, but I do want to change this assumption:\n\n&gt; the main response to it from neutral people has been that it sets a bad precedent\n\nI think there are quite a few such people, and very vocal, on reddit. But the vast, vast majority of people see coontown and similar things as horrible and don't even think about any \"bad precedent\" aspect to this topic. They are happy its gone, even if their happiness is pretty minor because they mostly just don't care.\n\nMost people on reddit don't comment on topics like the banning of coontown. Hundreds of millions of people use reddit, but only a few hundred, perhaps, talk about a \"bad precedent\".\n\nSo I think you're right to be happy that coontown was banned, but wrong in that most people probably agree with you.\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It doesn't mean freedom from consequences from everyone else\". If it's on the internet it is equally likely that this [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1357/) will be shown. This does seem at first to be a reasonable point of view. However, I believe it is flawed for several related reasons.\n\nThe first reason is that underestimates the power of the public. Just because the state is not infringing your right does not mean others cannot. With other rights this is accepted as part of the system. For instance, if a company refused to serve or allow access to black people that would be considered a violation of their rights despite it not being the government. In the same way, you couldn't claim a country has gender equality if women can't be get a job, despite there being no law against hiring women. Unless freedom of speech can be distinguished from those other rights, which I believe it cannot, there can be no distinction between private agents and the state in terms of freedom of speech.\n\nSecondly, the right to free speech includes the right to unimpeded free speech, if that makes sense. It is not enough to be allowed to say what you want, you have to be allowed to communicate to who you want. It makes more tense in terms of letters. Freedom of speech is not fulfilled by allowing me to write letters, it is only fulfilled by allowing their delivery. Using the example from the comic, continually showing someone the door is the same as standing by the pillar box and shredding the letters as I post them.\n\nThe final reason is that extreme reactions to someone's use of free speech can restrict it by effectively punishing them for exercising their right. If I punched someone for suggesting marmite was a valid option for toast, would I not be restricting their right to free speech? Equally, if I was sacked for making a racist reddit post, am I not being punished for exercising my right to freedom of speech? I'm not entirely convinced on this point because it might restrict someone else's freedom of speech to criticise or their freedom of association to not have to put up with me, but I would still say there is some validity to this point.\n\nJust to be clear, I don't think freedom of speech should never be restricted but I do think those restrictions should be acknowledged which the phrase \"freedom of speech, not freedom from consequences\" does not. \n\n\nSome people seem to be confused about what I mean by a private entity. I simply mean someone who isn't the state or acting as an agent of the state. I never meant to imply that I would start talking shit in your living room. Freedom of speech doesn't make crimes less illegal do to be clear I'm not advocating that in the slightest.\n\n\nA lot of the comments have struggled with what the view is, despite it being repeated multiple times. I'm not interested in acting as reading adviser. If your comment doesn't address the view, I'm not going to bother responding.\n\n/u/Vordreller found this bastardised version of the [comic](http://sealedabstract.com/rants/re-xkcd-1357-free-speech/), and from John Stuart Mill onwards, I agree with the sentiments the creator expresses. If you want to see my argument in comic form, you couldn't get much closer than that.\n\nFirst Reply:\n if I was sacked for making a racist reddit post, am I not being punished for exercising my right to freedom of speech?\n\nThis is why people struggle with free speech. \n\nThe short answer is no. You can say whatever you want. You can't however say what you want and expect others not to react to your words. I can't go to my friends house and say that his wife is a cunt and expect to be invited over next week. I can't tell my employer that I feel that black people are inferior to whites and then expect to represent my boss by wearing his company's name badge to work. \n\nYou are asking for speech with no consequences. That has never been protected and never will. \n\nA company can remove you for saying racist comments. An online company doesn't have to provide a platform for all types of speech. edit a word\nSecond Reply:\n&gt;  if a company refused to serve or allow access to black people that would be considered a violation of their rights despite it not being the government. In the same way, you couldn't claim a country has gender equality if women can't be get a job, despite there being no law against hiring women. Unless freedom of speech can be distinguished from those other rights, which I believe it cannot, there can be no distinction between private agents and the state in terms of freedom of speech.\n\nThe major distinction I see here is that race, gender, sexuality, etc., those are all things that a person can't control those things about themselves. You can't decide not to be black or a woman or gay or whatever for a while because you're around people who don't like those types of people. You can try and hide it or downplay that part of you, but (at least for race and gender) those are characteristics about you that are immediately visible, permanent, and part of you. \n\nSpeech is different. You don't ever *have* to speak. If you believe strongly that the Holocaust didn't happen, that doesn't mean that whenever you walk by a synagogue you automatically and uncontrollably start spewing out anti-Semitic comments. Speech is an action, whereas race or gender are not actions but qualities of a person which they can't reasonably change. \n\nThat's why you can't ban someone for being black but you can ban them from shouting racial slurs in your restaurant. They can't control what race they are, but they can control what they can say. That's a fundamental difference."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

So I thought, why would a police officer even use firearms (I mean the guns that can kill, I'm not sure since it's not my native language) if he/she doesn't intend to kill? I have seen the tranquilizer guns making animals unable to even move, so wouldn't they be quite useful? Thanks to this, they could've shoot the suspect without worrying about killing him/her, and accidents where the innocent people are dying wouldn't happen. Plus, even if the suspect is really guilty, a police officer shouldn't kill him/ her, right? And if something happens like in the scenes we see in the movies, where the criminal takes a hostage and police officers can't shoot because they are afraid of hurting the hostage, wouldn't this make everything easier? They could've just shoot without worrying about anything, and make both the hostage and the criminal collapse?\n\nFirst Reply:\nThat is a terrible idea, tranquilizers can easily be lethal, or cause permanent damage if not properly administered. Their effectiveness is extremely affected by characteristics an officer would not be able to know, primarily weight. \n\nFurthermore we already have a perfectly acquit non-lethal weapon for police to use, taser guns. The can quickly disable the target without death or long term injury. \nSecond Reply:\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n\"Tranquillizer darts are not generally included in military or police less-than-lethal arsenals because no drug is yet known that would be quickly and reliably effective on humans without the risks of side effects or an overdose. This means that effective use requires an estimate of the weight of the target to be able to determine how many darts (if any) can be used. Shooting too few would result in no effect whatsoever, while too many can kill the target. According to James Butts, Santa Monica, CA Chief of Police, \"Tranquilizing agents don't affect everyone uniformly. Therefore you cannot predict whether or not you have a sufficient dose to tranquilize the individual. Second, any tranquillizer will take time to enter the bloodstream and sedate the individual. If someone is advancing on you with a deadly weapon or a threatening object, there's no way a tranquillizer would take effect in the two to three seconds it would take someone to seriously injure you.\"[6]\"\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tranquillizer_gun#Military_and_police_use"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

My mother has lived in Canada for almost twenty years now and she still has trouble sometimes. My view is that all immigrants should strive for at the very least an [intermediate](http://www.londonschool.com/level-scale/) mastery. \n\n* My one exception would be if an immigrant does not have the financial capability to pay for lessons in the language of the country they've moved to. However, in Canada at least, free English lessons are offered to new immigrants, so I wouldn't see any reason to not learn the language here. \n\nNot learning the primary language of the country they've moved to encourages segregation and often leads to racial or cultural tension. By refusing to learn the primary language to an acceptable extent, they're showing a blatant refusal to adapt even a little to their new country's culture. Even if you're living in an area where you could live your entire life speaking your mother tongue, it doesn't make sense to not at least do the bare minimum to adapt. What's the point of coming all the way to another country if you're not going to respect it? Multiculturalism is wonderful and should be valued, but refusing to learn the country's language and creating enclaves is *preventing* multiculturalism. \n\nFirst Reply:\nI don't know much about the Canadian immigrant experience, but I can talk about America, which I think applies.\n\nFirst of all,  for the past 200 years, older people immigrating have very often kept their original language.\n\nNow, virtually all of their children became fluent English speakers.  And many of these are the most \"patriotic\" (whatever that means) people, who no doubt respect their country.\n\nBut their parents formed enclaves - Little Italy, Chinatown, the Lower East Side, and on and on.  Today, in Minnesota, we have groups of Somali and Hmong where all of the kids (at least those who have been here a while) are fluent in English, but the older community members still speak their native language.\n\nThey learn about the country, pay taxes, are thankful to be here.  But it's damned hard to up and move to a new place.  The food, customs, living spaces, jobs- all different.  Now, of course the first ones to come need to learn the language, because they don't yet have a community.  But the rest tend to go where there are others already like them.\n\nWhy add the burden of learning a new language (which is difficult at an older age)?  Their kids will know it, and can help them when translations are needed.\n\nConsidering that this was the case for centuries, are you really arguing that Italians, Jews, Germans, Chinese, Japanese, Russians, etc,etc never became part of the culture?  That we haven't swirled their customs into the melting pot?\nSecond Reply:\nI can understand how it appears this way, but I think you are misunderstanding people's intentions and realities. I grew up among immigrant communities in Queens, NYC and worked a decent amount providing social services to immigrants.\n\nThe immigrants that you're talking about, that don't learn English, generally don't move to America because they love American culture and want multiculturalism. They do it for practical and survival-oriented reasons. They keep their heads down and work hard and try to make money so that they can help their children have a less crappy life, or so that they can send money to their impoverished families. Or, they flee here because shit is godawful in their home country and they just want to mind their own business and live with a modicum of stability and do better.\n\nA lot of these people are really poor. Sometimes, they have degrees from their home countries that don't count for anything in America. So they work long hours 6 days a week in entry-level shitty paying jobs in restaurants or nail salons or driving cabs. They are often financially exploited. After all that work, they just get by paying expensive rent and try to save enough to send money to their families. Some community-based organizations and libraries do offer English language classes. But when would they squeeze that in? They are busy working and scraping by - they often don't have the time or the energy to take classes. If you ask if they want to learn English, many of them will say yes. They may insist that their children learn English and worry that their kids won't speak perfect English. But I think Maslow's hierarchy of needs applies here. If they are living in an enclave where English isn't part of the essential skills necessary for success, and they are working hard to keep afloat, English is going to drop by the wayside. It's not about respect; it's about survival."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

No hypocrisy. All because someone has the title of a law enforcer doesn't mean that they shouldn't follow the same legal process as a citizen would. I mean, what if an officer showed up to the scene of a shooting (in which the shooter called 911 for help) and the shooter was there with the weapon and openly admitted to killing the victim in self-defense (which upon observation it was blatantly obvious it wad self-defense)? Surely the officer would draw his/ her weapon at the murderer and scream to get down. They would proceed to cuff them and bring them to the station for booking/ questioning. If an officer called in for back-up after killing someone (even if was obviously out of self defense) they would be approached with \"hey are you okay?\" and \"Let's get the paperwork out of the way so you can have your paid leave.\" That to me is hypocritical. Take away the uniform and you have a person who just killed another person.\n\n2. It would make officers think twice before drawing. If they knew they would be processed and charged with murder, I would argue that there would a significant decline in police shootings.\n\n3. It gives the victim a fair chance at their side. Even if they are dead, treating an officer like a criminal discredits any story they come up with giving a better chance for the true series of events to surface. We have seen A LOT of cops make up shit that \"justifies\" the killing when later proved wrong by cameras. If people could just make up stories and be believed 100%, I could go outside right now, shoot someone in the head while no one is looking, plant a knife, claim they came at me with a knife, and get away with 2nd degree murder.\n\nEven if an officer witnessed another officer kill a person when it was blatantly self-defense (eg the person had a gun pointed at the officer) they should still be cuffed and taken in. Just apply the same situation to 2 citizens, surely the one who lives would be charged with murder and only the results of an investigation would set them free.\n\nI'm just frustrated with all the bull shit I hear about cops and would like to hear the logic of the other side because I feel I'm blinded from it. So CMV.\n\nFirst Reply:\nThe problem is that people want to make the jobs of police officers impossible and that is what you are doing. This of it this way. If you were a police officer and they made your idea into law would you continue to be a police officer? Hell no. \n\nIf police were held to the same laws as other citizens while they were working the job would actually be impossible and no sane person would sign up to do it. How would you suggest a police officer give a speeding ticket without speeding to catch the guy? It would be impossible. Now extend this to a police officer that is called for a possible armed robbery. How could the police officer defuse the situation and possibly save someones life if they were worried about getting arrested for murder?\n\nI'm not saying there isn't a problem with police in this country but there is clearly also a problem with the way this countries citizens view the law. People view the law as suggestions and often ignore them. In so many of these high profile police cases the citizen is blatantly refusing to cooperate this the officer. This is an issue on both sides of the law there. There is mistrust for the government and usually the officer uses too much force or is racially biased. Both things need to change.\n\nThe most famous case of police misuse of force (Michael Brown) still really bugs me. People got up in arms because the officer didn't get put in prison for murder. The thing is there clearly wasn't enough evidence to convict that officer of murder. It was always obvious. That officer went on trial for murder and a bunch of people filed conflicting police reports on what happened so any eye witness account was put into question. The people that filed police reports when they didn't know what they were doing fucked up that case and might have got a guilty man set free. THE CIZITIZENS NEED TO CHANGE MORE THAN THE POLICE\nSecond Reply:\nThe first thing you need to recognize is that a police officer isn't just another citizen. They have specialized training because their job puts them in a level of danger that other people don't face. The only comparable group is the military, and that justifies a special set of rules. If all you see is a few cases of unjustified homicide, and you completely ignore the danger that *millions* of officers confront and handle *daily*, then there is no hope to change your view."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It's plausible that there are people who are unemployed because they can't pass a drug test. Maybe instead of testing all applicants and potentially wasting lots of money, you could track the job search progress of applicants and require them to report the results of drug tests those employers administered. Obviously this is only applicable to unemployment benefits and not medicare or food stamps.\nSecond Reply:\nIt may potentially be a good idea if certain conditions are met:\n\n1. The recipient has previously been convicted of a drug related crime. \n\n2. Initial positives are treated as false, and more stringent testing is done before any benefits are removed. \n\n3. Benefits are not removed until the a second round of testing occurs after a time frame that would allow the initial results to have left the body. \n\n4. Treatment is made available for addiction.

It seems perfectly normal to look for inspiration on other things, but then again, it makes me feel as if the art isn't as original as it should be.\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nI think originality is really a lie people like to feed themselves. basically of creativity is built and inspired by other creative works, and originality for the sake of originality is often not worth it.\n\n\nPersonally I wouldn't get a tattoo, because almost every year I decide that past me was an idiot, and I wouldn't trust my decision making. That being said, if I was to get a tattoo, it would probably be unoriginal as fuck. I'd rather have something that's comfortable and exciting to me, than an original work of art on my body, because I don't think body art is the way I would choose to express my individuality. \nSecond Reply:\nInspiration does not make you unoriginal.\n\nIt's impossible not to be influenced by environment.\n\nEvery person saw 100s maybe 1000s tattoos, no new tattoo will be 100% original, it will be inspired by tattoos that you saw in the past consciously or unconsciously.\n\nIt is absolutely possible to cerate a new and original work of art that is inspired by other art.\n\nFor example when Hamlet wrote Hamlet he was clearly inspired by Icelandic tales and Scandinavian myth - yet Hamlet is an original work of art.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sources_of_Hamlet\n  "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Thus it is likely that given advanced enough technology, we could make a digital human, or even copy an organic human to the digital world.\n\nSimilarly, other neural networks can be constructed digitally, collectively known as AI. This is fairly well accepted in modern society, although there are debates over 'souls' and things like that.\n\nI think that sentient AI will probably emerge first, long before we get close to digitizing humans, because of the way AI may emerge. Currently, one approach to developing advanced neural networks is to allow them grow 'naturally', which is to say that the network is given some parameters to optimize, and then iterations darwinistically decide what the optimal solution is. Pretty much like carbon-based evolution, but much faster.\n\nHowever, I'm not an expert in the field, so I'm open to different opinions, or even alternatives not the above two options. CMV: AI will achieve sentience way before we can make computer humans.\n\n\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nWhat you're describing is genetic programming.\n\nPerhaps we will achieve sentience sooner than digitized humans. Doing it through genetic programming has a few issues, however.\n\nConsider consciousness. Have you figured it out? Yes? Good, I'm glad we had this discussion, turn in plans for your Nobel Prize and let the Singularity begin.\n\nNo? That's disappointing. Oh well. Consciousness is very complex. How do you test if something has met the parameters for intelligence? Solving intelligent tests? At one point, that test was Chess. We did it, we made computers that were very good at making Chess moves, but they had no idea what Chess was, what it symbolized, what the significance of Chess was, they only knew some numbers tied to some positions. They likely didn't even know what winning or losing meant.\n\nNext, there was the Turing test. Eugene Goostman beat the Turing test, but was still not considered to have our level of consciousness, if any at all. This is because the Turing test is very, very good at determining if you're SIMULATING consciousness. But not if you're actually conscious. Imagine it like school tests. What are they really measuring? How good are you at math or how good are you at getting the answers to the test? You'd think they're the same, but does getting a high math score prove that you know what math is? Why it's significant? Why it's beautiful? Why these equations are important in everyday life? No. A high math score just means you know how to solve the problems on the test.\n\nThen there's the self awareness test, the Tokyo test, etc. We have a history of not having the BEST way to determine consciousness. We're not sure what it is. Maybe consciousness is a spectrum or continuum and we've already solved consciousness, but the AI we're making isn't conscious ENOUGH.\n\nBut back to genetic programming, eliminating what doesn't work and letting the best survive. The problem with genetic programming is, let's say you do find a way to test consciousness. It's probably going to involve a LOT of factors, right? Ability to have opinions, ability to change itself, ability to feel, ability to use natural language, ability to create, debate, CMV, etc. Consider the pragmatics.\n\nHow long it takes for each AI to see if they pass they test or to even realize they're testing. If you just force them, for all you know, you could just be making an AI that's programmed specifically to do each thing individually without filling in the gaps of consciousness in between. No, you need AIs that do a bunch of those things individually. How long do you leave it alone to see if it does anything before you eliminate the AI? Or do you take up an ungodly amount of resources to keep a bunch of complex computers the size of warehouses around, possibly taking up miles?\n\nAnd you're doing this with each iteration. It could take forever.\n\nThen, consider the ethics. Killing an AI because it's not \"good enough?\" Sound familiar to anyone? Are we allowed to do that because they're subhuman or something? That's another consideration. Is it okay to have an AI thrown into a test it knows nothing about only to kill it before it has a chance to have a quality life? In all likelihood, because of the randomness of their iterations, most of the AIs will be insane if they do become sentient and they'll suffer. They'll suffer real bad.\n\nSo, genetic programming, in my non-expert opinion, is not a good approach to conscious AI. Feel free to CMV.\nSecond Reply:\nWhat is happening inside neural networks isn't that different from what is happening inside your brain. Connections are constantly made and destroyed based on input, trying to optimize how certain task is performed. Optimizing a neural network is more similar to \"learning\" rather than \"evolving a brain\". How intelligent a neural network can become is limited by its design. If I build a neural network, it will never become intelligent, even if I let it run for years. Just like you can train a raccoon for years but it will never become smarter than a raccoon. You will never get a point where sentient AI will \"emerge spontaneously\". We will have to create it ourselves. Our systems will become better and smarter with each design iteration, until one day they are good enough to be indistinguishable from what we call \"intelligence\".\n\nAt the end of the day simulating a brain requires little understanding of how it works, but needs A LOT of computational power. Even simulating realistically a couple of neurons takes supercomputers. Building something intelligent from the ground up will be more efficient, but then you need to know precisely how to create such a system (i.e. deep understanding of intelligence and sentience).\n\nThe question which will happen first depends on how fast each field is advancing. If it turns out we are better at making faster computers and intelligence is extremely complex, then simulation will be first. If we turn out to be good at understanding how brains work, we might create AI before the tech simulating brains is available. Saying one will happen for certain is premature. After all, computers double in computational speeds every 18 months. Our understanding of brains and intelligence grows slower than that. There is a chance simulation will be first."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

They already made the decision to eat meat as a child without thinking about it at all, and they want to keep doing it so they try to explain to themself why they do it instead of honestly thinking about whether or not they actually should.\n\nEating meat can never be more or as ethical as not eating meat, because you're taking life needlessly and contributing to/causing (no snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible) all kinds of abuse towards animals. But people just dont really give a shit.\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nI eat meat and care very much for morality. I was a vegetarian for many years for the usual reasons: not approving of the horrible ways the animals are often treated in industrial meat production, wanting to avoid the environmental impact of industrial farming, etc.\n\nAlthough there were other factors involved as well, I started eating meat again because I accepted that:\n\n1) By choosing to eat meat that is hunted by myself or someone I know, raised by someone I know, or raised free-range on grass from a company I trust, I take ownership of how the animal is being treated and help create a market for ethically-raised meat.\n\n2) Many of the protein alternatives that vegetarians consume are actually as destructive to the environment as ethically-raised meat or worse. Soy production, for example, is extremely problematic.\n\nSo, yes, I care very much, but came to the conclusion that becoming a total vegetarian was not necessary within my morals.\nSecond Reply:\nWhile I agree that a lot of people opinions towards eating meat is basically 1. i was raised eating mean 2. meat is delicious 3. i dont care much for animals 4. there are plenty of people who don't care therefore i eat meat. i personally had thought about it and i could not find a way to justify not eating meat.\n\nkilling animals can not be immoral, because morality is a manifestation of a system of behaviour which maximises a persons chance of survival and reproduction. a person does not steal because doing so will piss other people off and make enemies. the same is true of killing. and because humans are social animals, it is very important to not piss other people off because the long term benefits of cooperation with others greatly outweigh the short-term gain. so one can not extend said morality system to animals, because man does not need to not kill animals in order to use animals, and because animals can not reciprocate whatever moral system that a human might subscribe to. an animal does not have an idea of ownership, pets will steal food from your plates, and animals will kill and eat you in the wild. \n\nas for the health reason, well, any nutritional study shows that SOME meat is beneficial. while the largely meat-based diet of modern USA is clearly bad, some meat is clearly good, so for me, i would eat more vegetables and fruits than meat, but i would still eat meat.\n\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Within a few centuries, they'll replace almost all of them\nIt's already been happening with factory workers, online shopping, etc., and with self-driving cars on the horizon and computing technology getting better and better, the long-term job security for many professions is shaky at best. This surge in unemployment may even cause a great economic crisis. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU) explains the situation quite well.\n\nBONUS: With many humans out of jobs, I've heard talks of unconditional basic income eventually being required. Indeed, the idea that everyone should have a job may become more arbitrary as time goes on as fewer people are able to contribute to the economy. Robots will simply do everything better, making humans far less useful and needed.\n\nFirst Reply:\nYou are to a certain extent conflating automation (ability of a machine to do relatively simple, repetitive tasks) and AI. \n\nThe implications of AI depend strongly on the abilities of that AI, which could be roughly classified like this:\n\n1. Narrow AI. Can do specific tasks that are not purely automated, but still relatively low-level. \n2. Analytical AI. Can effectively analyze (in a high-level way) problems with objective solutions. For example, this AI could determine the best treatment for a patient given information on research and the patient's symptoms and test results.\n\n3. Innovative AI. Can come up with truly new ideas and create truly novel things on its own.   For example, this AI could come up with the idea for a new product and design it.\n4. Total AI. Can do literally everything the human mind can do, including things like creating art.\n\nAI of types 1 and 2 essentially increase productivity, but humans remain generally necessary to design new things.  Although it will displace many types of jobs, society with type 2 AI will still have a very broad need for humans to work. \n\nType 3 AI will start closing the loop and therefore cutting humans out of the loop in a more complete way. At that point, the need for humans will be limited to things like the arts.  \n\nThe question, then, is how far are we away from type 3 AI?  We are increasingly developing type 2 AI, but we are conceptually very far away from type 3 AI.  Far enough away that major conceptual leaps will be required to get us there, and it is hard to predict how long it will take us to make those leaps.  It may occur in our lifetimes, it may not.\nSecond Reply:\nI've seen this video (love CGP), and I feel yes and no.\n\nPoint A) *within the next few decades, AI will replace a sizable portion of our jobs.*\n\nYes. This much is clear, and it's hilarious because, as genetic modification makes our food more vulnerable to disease, by creating specialization in our economy we have set ourselves up for this. No arguments there.\n\nPoint B) *Within a few centuries, they'll replace almost all of them.*\n\nHere I disagree. We're going to go through a real rough patch, perhaps even causing a weird Great Depression style collapse, but 200 years ago, 90 percent of Americans were agriculturalists. Today, that number is two percent. We evolved, and if you remember the dust bowl struggles when industrial farming came about, you'll remember that was a struggle too.\n\nWe'll remodel our society, as we have for the past forever, to fit needs that, in theory, robots cannot fill, including:\n\n1. **Space exploration and colonization.** Yes, robots have been and are doing an amazing job exploring space for us already, but the value of having a human on another planet, or out in space exploring, is uncountable. AI would help us be able to focus more on the expansion of our species into space.\n\n2. **Entertainment** My biggest disagreement with the CGP video is how he frames the idea of entertainers being replaced by AI. Sure, they can write beautiful music, but how much is recorded music going for right now, anyway? And people enjoy watching PEOPLE perform. There's nothing particularly beautiful about an arabesque, but what's beautiful is watching a person do it. Same with acting, singing, sports, etc.\n\n3. **Engineering**: This one seems pretty simple. It'll be a long time (in theory) before we can automate robots that can out engineer us. \n\n4. **Cyber Protection** This is the biggest one. If all of our medical information is on a universal collection of robot interfaces, we will need basically an endless army of humans to help defend this from hackers. The more AI we have, the more we need to protect it. People who would be able to take control of that AI would control the world.\n\nThere's a lot more, and it's going to be a hard road, but at the end of it, our society will evolve so that our jobs will be more fulfilling and human-necessary. Just as you don't weep for the Iceman, the Lamplighter, and the Switchboard Operator, know that no one will be weeping for the barista, the paralegal, or taxi driver."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

This includes language such as \"Pepper spray can deter attackers of any kind, and therefore it is strongly recommended that ANYBODY carries it with them at all times.\" or \"Hot zones for crime include times after dusk and before dawn, so it is advised to travel in groups at this time to deter attackers.\"\n\nPeople rage at this information saying that I should not ask anything of the victim, and that this information is useless.

I understand that it's the service that they provide and not just the food, but isn't that exactly what they're paid for? To give a paying customer a good service? Although I sympathize with their outrageously low wages, but why should I have to fork out more of my money that I'm already spending at a restaurant to subsidize young Jenny here, to get her up to normal living wage? Isn't that a governmental issue of poverty/low wages?\nFirst Reply:\nThey are working for their wages, the only difference is that in some industries those wages come straight from the customer instead of the customer's money going to the business owner and then back to the employees. Tipping essentially cuts out the middle man, and allows you to directly pay the person providing you with a service instead of giving your money to the business, having the business take its cut, and then giving some of that money back to the employees. \n\nAs for why you should have to, well, technically you don't (unless the restaurant/business includes a tip as a part of your bill). If tipping was eliminated then you would probably see an increase in the price of tipped services to make up for the increased wages of servers. In other words, your $10 cheeseburger might go up to $12 to make up for the 20% tip that people don't leave anymore. So instead of paying $10 with a $2 tip for that cheeseburger, you're paying $12 with no tip so the restaurant can pay its servers more than $3/hr. On top of that, the servers don't have as much of an incentive to provide top notch service since they'll be making the same amount regardless. You're drinks might take longer to get refilled, or your food might take longer to be brought to you. You're still paying the same amount, but now you're getting worse service.\nSecond Reply:\nAlthough you personally do not like tipping, the custom exists for good reason. If people did not tip and servers had to earn their living from only wages, food prices would increase to compensate the additional cost required to sustain the servers.  In addition to this, not tipping is typically frowned upon because the stiff is disregarding the server's humanity.\n\nEliminating the tip would not save money for anyone in the long run because restaurants will simply up the price of their food. Imagine a scenario in which one had to pay $10 + at least 20% tips, thus raising the price to $12. If tipping ceased, the restaurant would simply raise the initial price of the food to $12. The consumer still has to pay the same amount. However, under the tip system, servers can try to provide better service because they have an incentive for doing so. Tipping helps both the consumer and the server, and as such, it is more preferrable to tip than provide a base wage.\n\nThe server is paid a base wage of +/- $2/hour to ensure that they walk home with at least something. It's a protection of their income stability, much like how many salespeople of supermarkets like Walmart are paid much lower than what the skill demands because salespeople make commission. The base wage for a server is not meant to sustain the server. It is only meant to be used as a backup if income from tips is too low. Servers actually earn their money from providing and enhancing a good service by taking away plates and bringing food to the customer. Keep in mind that when consumers pay the price tag for the meal, they are paying only for the cook's labor and the cost of the ingredients. Tips are not factored in because they provide an incentive for servers to give giving a better service. While you may argue that cooks should be tipped too under this logic because then cooks have an incentive to cook better, the action is simply unrealistic to implement because a cook spends most of his or her time optimizing efficiency in the kitchen. To have to deal with tips is to immediately handicap the maximum achievement the cooks can accomplish.\n\nPeople who serve are doing so to sustain their families. They try to provide the best service because they need something from you: money. A person who does not tip goves everyone else around him or her that he or she is rich, but chooses to spend cheaply anyway. It's a rude gesture, especially when someone else (the server) is expending a reasonable effort to provide the consumer with a better environment surrounding a meal. Tipping shows some respect to the server, which is arguably more important than saving $2 here and there. It's common knowledge that people didn't pay for the service up front and that stiffing the server results in making the server's life harder to live."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Basic income would serve as the basic means to redistribute resources, based on the idea that automation and organization which allows much of our current productivity is a common resource, not a private one. This would indeed serve to mitigate the consequences of automation and concentration of capital in the hands of ever fewer owners, but first and foremost it's a different way to organize resource distribution, since labor is no longer in chronic shortage, so it makes no sense to force people to provide it by threats of misery and starvation.\n\n&gt;But that is frictional unemployment, not structural.\n\nThat's just your opinion.\n\n&gt;The huge issue is when you have a dead wage safety net you create a massive systematic disincentive to people to work.\n\nThe current system punishes people who start working and stop being eligible for welfare, by taking away that welfare.

Employees would be indifferent because they aren't netting less money, since basic income would make up the difference. Competitive wages would suffer. \n\n*Then* they would effectively reduce the added value of work for their employees, who would quit - because now they *do* have an alternative.

Under this interpretation, homosexuality should be judged to be just as immoral as wearing mixed fabrics or eating pig, which to almost all Christians is \"not at all\". In fact, the notion that \"homosexuality is a sin\" is inconsistent with the theme of the New Testament, which Christians put much more emphasis on. In the New Testament, Jesus encourages believers not to judge the immorality of a person by what is socially acceptable, which is essentially what those who would say that homosexuality is a sin are doing.\n\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nWell, yea.\n\nThere is a large and growing number of Christians, including religious leaders, theologians, historians, and whole denominations, who don't think a universal and eternal condemnation of all same gender relationships is an accurate understanding or appropriate application of scripture.\n\nThe Episcopal church is not a small or marginalized denomination, and the church General Convention recently voted with an 85% majority to [**extend the sacrament of marriage to same gender couples**](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/07/01/why-the-episcopal-church-is-still-debating-gay-marriage/). And they are [**far from alone**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT-affirming_Christian_denominations).\n\nAlso, why would you think that all sexuality is a sin? It's not a sin to sexually desire your own spouse.\n\nIt's worth noting that Reconstructionist, Reform, and most branches of Conservative Judaism do not think same gender relationships are inherently sinful either. Even the famous Levitical passages aren't a blanket condemnation of same gender relationships. Among other things, they don't say anything about relationships between women at all. They exclusively address sex between men, and only under the specific conditions in which one man is being treated *\"as if he were a woman.\"*\n\nThere are a lot of different ideas on what exactly that meant when it was written. Conservative Judaism tends to understand it as condemning penetrative sex between men, without condemning other forms of sex or relationship between men. Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism, and many branches of Christianity, tend to see these passages as forbidding men from using sex as a form of ownership over other men, with implications of sexual slavery.\n\nIn both cases, these are culturally and historically specific texts referring not to gay people in general, but to the execution of people believed at the time to either be endangering the foundations of the universe, or people engaged in sexual slavery and rape.\nSecond Reply:\nI'm no biblical scholar, but the learnin' I did in church taught me that pretty much *everything* is a sin.  Certainly nearly everything *sexual* is a sin.  The only exception would be intercourse for the purpose of pro-creation.\n\nSo looking at a woman with lustful thoughts is a sin.  Looking at pornography is a sin. Masturbation is a sin.  And, certainly, man-on-man anal sex is a sin.\n\nSo the only way that homosexuality *wouldn't* be a sin is if it were never an influence in one's life.  That mean, a dude can't even *think about* how good some cowboy's ass looks in his chaps.  And if you never even get to the point of thinking about stuff like that, how do you define it as homosexuality in the first place?  Homosexuality *is* the lusting after members of the same gender.\n\nSo while I would be more inclined to agree that homosexuality is no more or less of a sin than non-reproductive-oriented heterosexuality, I don't see how you could claim that homosexuality isn't a sin at all."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

If you use the drug (nicotine), it can directly affect the health of those close to you. \n\nSmoking harms nearly every organ in the body, causing cancer and disease. Cigarettes are extremely addictive and many people can't quit even if they try.\n\nYet other drugs pose less threats and have a much lower or even a nonexistent fatality rate. They certainly aren't killing 1,300 people per day. \n\nCan you imagine if an illegal drug killed over 1,000 people everyday, users and nonusers? There would be political crusades.\n\nFor all illicit drugs combined, the number of resulting deaths were about 17,000 in 2013. For all drugs combined -- legal and illegal -- that number jumped to about 46,500 for that same year. That's an extra 29,500 deaths from legal drugs.\n\nCigarettes cause 10x more deaths per year than all the drugs in the US.\n\nWhy are we pouring so much time, resources and money into the Drug War to keep these *super dangerous* illegal drugs out of the hands of the American public such as marijuana (easy argument, 0 deaths) or even heroin (much more difficult argument, ~6,000 deaths in 2013) when cigarettes are so acceptable? \n\nCigarettes kill nearly half a million people per year and are the direct cause for serious health issues and reduced lifespan. They are highly addictive. If the objective of the War on Drugs is to keep people safe and not addicted to drugs, how can we rationalize this continuing support of cigarettes while stigmatizing the use of other, less harmful drugs? \n\n- - -\n\n**Reasons I think we overlook this high fatality rate...**\n\n* culture and ingrained public perception of acceptance. \n\nCigarettes used to be advertised as good for you and everybody knows somebody who smokes. Smoking is not something you necessarily have to hide. Jobs don't (generally) screen for cigarette smokers.\n\n* in the eyes of the public, cigarettes aren't really \"drugs\" (i.e. they don't alter your state of consciousness; they don't get you high)\n\nAn 18 year old can legally buy as many packs of cigarettes as they want.  In the US, they can't even do that with alcohol (which gets you drunk). In states with legal marijuana, you also have to be 21 to buy/consume. \n\n* cigarettes don't cause immediate death. (shortsightedness)\n\nYou don't overdose on nicotine. Instead, cigarettes slowly kill you so there is no instant connection between cigarettes and death. For example, a heroin OD would be an instant \"drugs kill you.\" If you smoke a cigarette, you know you aren't risking your life right that second.\n\n- - -\n\n**What are some other reasons we overlook this fatality rate and continue to socially and legislatively accept cigarettes?** \n\n*Sources*\n\n[X](http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fast_facts/) [X](http://www.drugwarfacts.org/cms/Causes_of_Death#sthash.2ALBksdH.dpbs)      \nFirst Reply:\n&gt; If the objective of the War on Drugs is to keep people safe and not addicted to drugs, how can we rationalize this continuing support of cigarettes while stigmatizing the use of other, less harmful drugs?\n\nMaybe your premise is wrong about the objective of the War on Drugs. The War on Drugs came from the Nixon administration, with the *advertised* purpose ostensibly being to keep people safe and not addicted to drugs. But according to John Ehrlichman, who was counsel and Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs under Richard Nixon, the real purpose was different. Here is an excerpt from an interview with Dan Baum for the book \"Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure\":\n\n&gt;The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar Left, and black people. You understand what I\u2019m saying? We knew we couldn\u2019t make it illegal to be either against the war or black. But by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.\n\nAccording to the book, the rationale for the war on drugs was to target people who were not likely to vote for Nixon: \n\n&gt;The young, the poor, and the black. Nixon couldn't make it illegal to be young, poor, or black, but he could crack down hard on the illegal drug identified with the counterculture.\n\nIf the book is right, acceptance of cigarettes falls in line exactly with the War on Drugs.\nSecond Reply:\nI don't disagree with your claim that the war on drugs is stupid (I choose to believe that's your claim, and I agree).  \n\nBut to answer your hypothesis about why we're mysteriously okay with cigarettes, it's because it's a lot easier to keep something away from people than it is to TAKE something away from people.  If the default stance on marijuana was already that it was legal, it'd still be legal everywhere and you wouldn't be seeing many people trying to get it banned.  Same as alcohol.  \n\nBut when something is *already* illegal, it's a lot easier to keep it that way.  If cigarettes were illegal already, they'd likely be staying that way, for exactly the reasons you mentioned.  People would be saying \"Why on earth should we legalize these things?  We haven't even legalized stuff that's far less dangerous!\""}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

You get the idea, convince me we aren't in North Korea #2.\n\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nLets imagine a hypothetical: a person from this utopia comes here to try and tell us the truth (happens all the time in North Korea).\n\nNow, what would have to happen to stop us from finding out?\n\n1) massive internet monitoring and a flurry of deleted posts on reddit, facebook, twitter etc.  Have you noticed odd activity like that?\n\n2) If a billboard went up, or a person was handing out fliers, a government force would have to physically detain him.  To do that they would need to know the truth and believe in the rightness of their cause.  North Korea pulls that off by explicit indocrination.  We don'ty have that.  You couldn't count on our cops or military to follow those rules.  So they can't know.  And if our cops and military can't know the truth it means that whoever wants to spread the truth will have a long time to do so before the secret government forces can get from their base in washington to small town Ohio.  And when they arrive they better HOPE that this person didn't go straigth to the local police.

Otherwise you see people making end-runs around that censorship and finding widespread agreement.  For instance, if you are not allowed to say anything bad about the Emperor, you will inevitably find people sharply criticizing local police while maintaining that \"surely if the Emperor knew he would do something\".\n\nWe have no signs of that.  When you get close to saying something bad (for instance, your post) you aren't punished.  People don't agree on the \"close to saying it\" part because it doesn't match our experience.  To fool us this well, mere censorship would be grossly insufficient - you'd need supernatural mind control."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Draws doctrine from the Qu'ran (a holy book) and the Hadith (the biography of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)). \n\n**Sheik** - An educated religious leader that are theological scholars, and have power to issue religious opinions/rulings, known as *fatwas.*\n\n\n\nMy case is this.\n\n* **Fighting Islamic Terrorism through military force DOES NOT WORK.**\nThe emergence of ISIS/ISIL/Daesh is strong evidence that foreign invasions cannot create stability in a country.\n\n* **A key feature of Islamic Terrorism is theological ignorance.**\nIslam only permits violence in certain circumstances, which are fairly well established. This mirrors a general ignorance among Muslims of what Islam is. This is compounded by the fact that Sheiks pass on their knowledge to students via a mentoring process. Lines of Sheiks are dying out due to a lack of willing students, and knowledge is being lost with them. The pull of Islamism on young men may be contributing to this.\n\n* **A greater understanding of Islam is incompatible with Islamism** - The Qu'ran is a suprisingly thought-provoking text, even for the secular reader. It constantly promotes critical thinking, and warns against interpreting its verses in a dogmatic way. A study of the life of the Prophet (pbuh), where he only fought as a last resort and was firmly against the killing of non-combatants, is totally at odds with Islamists. The fact that modern Islamist organisations (eg. Al-Quaeda, ISIL) are theologically innovative (rather than trying to get back to 7th Century Islam) is something that Al-Quaeda openly admits and is one of their most obvious flaws to Muslim observers.\n\nMy solution is that the West, with its traditions of academic study and economic power at the greatest they have ever been, should help educate Muslim countries about their own religion. Education should be at the grass roots level, the theological, and academic levels. I think there is a rather poetic justification in that the Islamic Empire safeguarded many of the texts of Europe and the Greeks at the time Europe was going through its Dark Ages. A similar thing could be argued to be taking place in the Muslim World today. \n\n**TL;DR** - I think it would be more effective, more sustainable, and it would diffuse the antipathy towards Islam in the Western World. It answers a lot of the current political problems in Muslim countries and would help establish Islam as the progressive force I believe it has always been, rather than the regressive and conservative force people fear it to be. \n\nFirst Reply:\n&gt; Education should be at the grass roots level\n\nThat goes against your entire plan, It is not the responsibility of the west to \"educate\" muslims, That approach has resulted in nothing by continuous infantilization of muslims, treating them like irresponsible children that have no control over their own decisions.\n\n&gt; A greater understanding of Islam is incompatible with Islamism\n\nInterpretation of religious texts does magically yield liberal ideals. There are more Islamic scholars, more educated literate muslims now then there have ever been in the history of Islam.  Islamism does not only grow from fertile soil of ignorance, It is a coherent set of ideologies that has a wide support of both the uneducated masses and highly educated politicized muslims.\n\nHere's a better solution: Stop coddling muslims, stop thinking it is the responsibility of the west to \"westernize\" the muslim world. \n\nPersonally I think religion is bad, I'd prefer to see a world with no religion, If you manage to somehow read into the life of Muhammad and make that work in your head with a liberal point of view, That's awesome, But thinking you somehow got there because you have a more \"correct\" or \"enlightened\" understanding of his life is utter nonsense.\n\nSecond Reply:\nThe idea of a single, normative Islam is not a helpful construction to someone on the outside who wishes to treat Islam academically. Typically, all we require is self-identification as Muslim, and then the person defines _his_ Islam.\n\nWe try not to sign off on particular versions as authentic or real, and instead try to present the history, the branches, etc. Islamism finds itself on the tree of Islam when Islam is treated academically, and the idea that we couldn't somehow trace it back to the roots, that it would clearly be shown to be inauthentic, seems implausible.\n\nIf it's really to be treated academically, the message will be chaos. I'd like to compare it to my first steps into studying Christianity academically. I had a single view of Christianity in mind and believed that it was essentially straightforward, although there were minor wobbles. Catholics killed lots, Martin Luther saved us, and then America.\n\nI reacted in horror when I finally dug into Christianity academically. Not only were there Catholics, but there were Orthodox. And people who didn't think Jesus was God. And unitarians. And universalists. There were churches in Ethiopia and there were monophysites and diopho-whatevers. There were Chinese Christians who had some pretty weird views. Ebionites, which sounded racist. And God knows what relationship God, the Jews, and Christians are supposed to have.\n\nIt was chaos. An academic study of a religion rarely reveals a single, pure source. This is true in Islam too - few generations after the Prophet, the ummah is already split. And today it still is. Not just Sunni/Shia. There are also Ahmaddiya/Qadiani, who to outsiders are indistinguishible. There are four major schools of fiqh. And maybe this is the isnad for the use of the miswak during fasting, or maybe it's a pile of spaghetti.\n\n... and all of this plays directly into the hands of the Islamist. The average person will recoil from all the choice he's just been presented. All the Islamist has to do is present his purified, simple version, and he's saved the day. The average person does not want, cannot tolerate, cannot sustain so much complexity. The Islamist message is appealing _because_ it gives straightforward, unambiguous answers that do not require three pages of footnotes, even if they're wrong.\n\nYou want thinkers, but you cannot turn your average person into a \"thinker.\" This is not an insult - I've taught hundreds of good people, many of whom nevertheless fail to master any significant level of critical thinking. I know that most people fail not because of capacity, but because their environment does not afford them the sort of leisure they need. They have families. They have jobs.\n\nBesides, the West coming in to teach the Muslim world its faith... the audacity of the idea is breathtaking. Even if we were best positioned to do it, we'd hardly be the best positioned to do it. The backlash would probably invalidate the entire project.\n\nI'm not saying it wouldn't help for the average Muslim to know more about his religion. Any bit of extra knowledge anywhere would help. But simply because #1) military interventions haven't worked and #2) an educated populace would be nice, doesn't mean this is a workable solution."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this belief is rather ingrained.  \n\nMy wife and I are both children of Poor Asian immigrants to this country.  I will reflect on my mother\u2019s story.  She had me very young out of wedlock with no support from my biological father while her parents were stuck in our native country.  When she came to this country she was on government assistance.  With very little support she was able to finish community college, transfer to a four year college majoring in computer science eventually getting a Master\u2019s Degree.  Her story is not unique to the rest of my relatives or the Asian immigrant community.  I don\u2019t need to discuss how my wife and I are doing since we have greatly benefited from our parent\u2019s generation, their hard work and sacrifice.  \n\nI hear the arguments regarding systemic discrimination of blacks in this country.  I\u2019ve read Unequal Childhoods by Annette Laureau regarding kids in disadvantaged environments are less likely to succeed than those in middle to upper class upbringings.  However I don\u2019t completely buy into it.  I\u2019ve seen countless family members and friends go from food stamps to sedans in the burbs, and I attribute that to a culture centered around hard work, sacrifice, and education.  As my mom was going through school, we lived in poorer neighborhoods, and I was raised in neighborhoods with Blacks and Hispanics, sure I\u2019ll throw out the I had black friends card, I still do.   At the time we were on the same level economically, yet culturally we were worlds apart in what was emphasized from a parenting standpoint.  As I grew up I met more successful black kids in undergrad, grad school, work, but most of them came up from middle class upbringings.  They had no problems acting 'white' while I saw my childhood poor black friends get mocked for doing so, therefore I believe its a cultural part of poor black americans which is hindering them from assimilating into middle class america.  That is why I don\u2019t have compassion for the narrative that is pushed in the media for the poor black or hispanic american unable to rise from poverty.  I know this is a strong talking point for the right wing yet I have not read any tangible counter argument to the dispute the Poor Asian immigrant story.

It really hasn't been that long since that period and the racism from that still persist for a period of time after changes in laws.  In part the effects of that and the slavery thing is still ingrained in their culture. \n\nFor the Latino population, many are illegal immigrants, which really affects their earning potential. Then their families also tend to be bigger too which means more money needed to support. Teen pregnancy rates were also higher for them which hinders them too. \n\nAsians are lucky with not as strong discrimination and oppression.  I know there is racism, but it's not nearly the same as the other two population. It helps us get ahead as we are seen as \"smarter\" or \"hardworking\".  "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Only a small percentage of people care about the suffering of animals. The amount of people who make food choices and calculate animal suffering into the equation about what to buy is about 1-3 percent and has stayed that number for a long time. \n\nYou're making a moral argument where one really doesn't exist for the far, far majority of people. \n\nEven if you do, you being a vegan isn't going to change anything. There are 1.4 billion cows in the world. Do you really think your individual choice is going to affect that number? Is the total happiness rating of the 1.4 cows going to increase or decrease based on your personal choice?\nSecond Reply:\nDo you believe extinction is better than existence in captivity? If so I doubt I can help but if not please read on. \n\nBecause existence in captivity is certainly capable of providing more for an animal than the wild.

Those that fought for the cause of the Confederacy and helped further it, helped further \"the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition\" are culpable.\n\nPoint 1: Someone who fights for a racist cause, helps create an institution to power that racism, and otherwise spread it is racist. People who have done this don't deserve to be monumented, or at the very least don't deserve to be monumented something as defining as a town square.\n\nPoint 2: A monument with the words \"Our Confederate Soldiers\" cannot monument just the soldiers without endorsing their actions to some extent.\n\nPoint 3: The image of a Confederate soldier being a defining landmark in the center of a city is an endorsement of the Confederacies actions and perpetuates racism by virtue of it being a defining part of the cityscape.\n\n\nFirst Reply:\n&gt;Point 1: Someone who fights for a racist cause, helps create an institution to power that racism, and otherwise spread it is racist. People who have done this don't deserve to be monumented, or at the very least don't deserve to be monumented something as defining as a town square.\n\nA similar example I can think of is Nazi Germany. Under this point, any soldier of WW2 fighting for Germany would not deserve to be honored even if they weren't fighting for *the idea* of Nazism, but rather their homeland.\n\n[Karl-Heinz Rosch](https://www.warhistoryonline.com/war-articles/controversial-memorial-honor-wwii-german-soldier-karl-heinz-rosch.html) has a monument made of him, even though he was Wehrmacht. I believe he did heroic acts in the name of his country, not in the name of racism against the Jews.\nSecond Reply:\nJust because the Confederacy was founded out of a disagreement about slavery (which up until then, the north had been perfectly fine with, too), doesn't mean that you can just equate Confederate soldiers with racism.  Most of the people fighting for the Confederacy weren't fighting for racism.  They were fighting to save their own towns and homes and families.\n\nLook at it this way.  Let's say another country has had enough of America's shit and decides to attack us.  Iran or whoever starts landing ground troops in your hometown and is systematically working their way through your town, murdering your children, torching your homes, and raping your families.  \n\nAre you going to ask yourself if you believe in America's cause before you try to defend your family?  Or are you going to fight tooth and nail to save yourself?\n\nDoes that make you a supporter of whatever made America go to war in the first place?  Should we all forget what happened to you if it's later decided that we were actually in the wrong?"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I've been doing this for the past 15 years.\n\nI've been employing people for years that I have never met \u2014 and quite possibly never will meet.\n\nLast time I met any of my developers face to face was maybe 6 years ago.\n\nI perceive no value whatsoever in meeting face to face. None.\n\nWorking together in an office is an impediment to getting work done, and is a source of constant interruption.\n\nEmail is generally better for productivity than face to face contact, or instant messaging.\n\nBoth face to face contact, and instant messaging, are distractions, and are useful primarily in the situation that you cannot progress on anything without immediate input. Such situations are extraordinary.\n\nThe people I meet face to face in my life are my wife, my son, and our nanny. I don't have a social need for more.\n\nI believe people who think they need face to face contact for work in software development are either confusing social needs with work \u2014 or possibly, I would fear, aren't competent to work on their own. Or maybe they're involved in some kind of work that involves extraordinary synchronization \u2014 the kind of which I do not know.\n\nIf someone can't work independently, and must constantly interrupt other developers, I would consider them a burden, rather than an asset. To be an asset, one must be able to get work done on one's own, and coordinate as necessary.\n\nIn fact, I would go so far as to say that, if you're not going to physically touch the other person, there is nothing you can do in a face to face meeting that you cannot do online.\n\nThere's literally no reason to meet unless you're going to kiss, or have sex, or give a person a massage.\nFirst Reply:\nThis is a bit of a weird example, but Naughty Dog and Insomniac Games used to work in the same Universal Studios backlot. They pretty much worked in the same cubicles. The games they created, like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon, were better games because of the constant chatting between members of the two companies. Each of the two examined the other company's software and saw amazing new features they could add to themselves. It was a source of friendly competition, and everyone was involved. The softwares the two companies created proved to be some of the most top-selling and highly regarded Playstation titles at the time. None of this innovation would have happened if the employees of both worked online without physical contact with each other. Doesn't this show that sometimes, physical environments do help to make a better software in the first place?\nSecond Reply:\nYes, the coding part of software development requires focus.  Sure.\n\nBut good engineers care deeply about the product - they fight for things they care about, they tend to help define and drive features.\n\nTell me then, how do you come to consensus &amp; divide work with purely asymmetrical communication? How do you motivate remote employees?  \n\nMore often than not, remote shops have very poor answers to those questions, and as a result what they have are a number of a remote employees or contractors that just kind of mail it in.  It might be profitable if you have a good business model and do custom/enterprise software, but it's hard to build *great* product that way.\n\nDon't get me wrong, some companies have figured out how to do distributed correctly... but it's a very hard culture to build and maintain.\n\nI'm curious as to how you do it."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I do not want someone as President who will continue borrowing, and his personal borrowing habit bodes ill for our country's future (not to mention that he has nearly bankrupted Wisconsin). Also, I could not trust him with any executive power as he could use it to wipe out his personal CC and student-loan debt.\n\nCMV!\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nScott Walker: Having $10,000 in credit card debt means nothing if you make $137,092 a year as he does. He can easily pay that off in two months, and possibly pay it off in one if he has few bills due that month. That is fiscally responsible. \n\nDonald Trump: A cursory Google search actually puts him at being worth 4 billion. So you do have a point of him. \n\nEdit: It should also be noted that the President has very little power or influence over the federal budget. Congress sets the budget and the President executes what they set by approving it, or he vetoes the budget. \nSecond Reply:\nHiya!\n\nI think I disagree because I don't think that this aspect alone could trump (no pun intended, honestly) any amount of good a President could do. Eliminating a President because of one flaw, no matter how severe, can be bad.\n\nFor instance, if you had 10 candidates that exaggerate their finances while you have 1 candidate who doesn't, but has policies that would essentially end the world due to their nuke trigger-happy beliefs, I definitely would not vote the last one for fear of Cold War: The Sequel (This time, it's personal).\n\nI definitely would never vote Trump and Scott Walker either, but not for those reasons alone. Had they had incredible policies that would improve this nation better than the other candidates, I would have chosen them as the President despite this one aspect. There's a potential they may damage the economy somewhat, yes, but if their policies can make up for that, I'd choose them.\n\nUnfortunately, the examples you gave are bad Presidents altogether, but concrete examples aside, the concept is there.

In all of those cases, the speaker is not criticizing the subject of the speech for being thin.

The rules don't tell you to give up your seat for her, but you do.\n\nThis short scenario illustrates that rules and morals are two different things. However, I see more and more people defending actions saying it was \"legal\", and therefore it should be alright. \n\nThe death of Cecil the lion is an (extreme) example: the man who shot him defended himself by declaring that what he did was legal. As the global outrage over his actions showed us, it was however completely immoral.\n\nAnother example: bankers. I read in a book that bankers that are considered \"professional\" disregard their own morals as much as possible and instead try to do as much as is legally possible. Immoral bankers and brokers are a core part of why the 2008 crisis was able to happen.\n\nI think this illustrates what happens when people use the law as \"moral compass\": immoral behavior. \n\nSecondly, I think this is caused by the fact that our law is not our morals themselves but rather these morals applied into (simplified) rules.\n\nThirdly, I think it's impossible to enforce socially appropriate behavior like giving up your bus seat. This follows from my second viewpoint: because rules are simplified results of our morals, they can never cover every aspect of our lives, therefore leaving gaps for bus travellers and dentists and bankers to exploit.\n\n**I think it's up to us to be aware of this and never use the law as a moral compass. Please, change my view.**\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nPeople who use the defense that what they do is legal are not usually arguing sincerely that what they do is \"right\" from a moral perspective EDIT: because it is legal. Rather, either they don't consider their action immoral in the first place or don't care whether their actions were moral or not. \n\nThe principle they're using as a shield is not the idea that the law is always morally right. Very few adults believe that \"moral\" is identical with \"legal.\" However, most people agree that there is a general moral principle that you should follow laws, as laws are usually in place for the good of society. If no one followed any laws, we'd be pretty badly off. So when someone says that the immoral action they took was legal, we shouldn't read it as thinking laws define morality. Instead, we should view laws as an additional moral constraint we place on ourselves to avoid violence and chaos. \nSecond Reply:\nI think your assuming that everyone is a generally moral person. If everyone had a 100% agreeable and reliable moral compass, and always acted in accordance with it with no exception, we wouldn't need laws in the first place. \n\nFor example, laws are extremely good as moral compasses for psychopaths who completely lack a moral compass of their own. For a less extreme example, if your moral compass somehow allows you to drive drunk, I think most of us would agree that you should use the law as a moral compass instead."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

A majority of the other weapons have damage fall-off to discourage long-range play, further separating the sniper as a class. \n\nAs far as I can tell, snipers mainly exist to pick off slow moving or high value targets, which the spy already does and does in a more interesting (to play as and against) way.\n\nI can't see any way the sniper, sitting at the back of the map away from the action, adds to the game (as a side note, I also think the removal of sniper would do nothing but good for the class diversity on pubs).\n\nPlease, CMV!\n\nFirst Reply:\nAs someone who mained sniper in TF2, I can assure you that sniping in TF2 has its uses. Spies can't move as quickly as scouts or medics, normally. Snipers serve not only to kill high value targets but also targets which focus on agility. That guerrilla scout which picks off enemies slowly? Sniper can deal with that. That rocket-jumping soldier which no one can shoot? Snipers can pick the soldier out of the air easily because of an easily predictable trajectory. Counters to snipers come with the spy (if the sniper is a stationary shooter), the pyro (flames disrupt aim), and the demoman (area denial from arcing weapons like the grenade launcher and the stickybomb launcher). Hell, even a soldier's splash damage if used properly can deny a sniper's vantage point. With all these reasons, how is a sniper not a valuable class in TF2?\nSecond Reply:\n&gt; I don't think that anything would be lost from TF2 if sniper was entirely removed.\n\nWell, an entire group of people would lose their main and would most likely stop playing. Also, all the cosmetics and weapons for sniper would become worthless, which will impact the economy and fuck a lot of people over. \n\nNow, I'm not a competitive TF2 player, but I can tell you that sniper adds a lot. Without sniper, people don't have to be nearly as careful with their movement. Also, Sniper has the ability to turn the game around by making important picks like demo or medic. Without him, the losing team has a small chance of recovering if they lose an important class. \n\nAs for pubs,  sniper fullfills the same role as he does in competitve, which makes him valuable. \n\n&gt; A good sniper has no real counter apart from another sniper, making them frustrating to play against\n\nA good sniper can be countered by good spies, good soldiers (depends on the map) and a good scout (depends on the map). Also, if the team is careful and has good movement, average snipers will have a hard time picking them off. \n\nThey're only frustrating to play against if your team sucks, which is true for the rest of the classes as well. \n\n&gt; As far as I can tell, snipers mainly exist to pick off slow moving or high value targets, which the spy already does and does in a more interesting (to play as and against) way.\n\nHe also denies the enemy certain paths, something the spy can't do. He also has different counters. \n\n&gt;  I also think the removal of sniper would do nothing but good for the class diversity on pubs\n\nYou can make the same case for scouts, spies and engineers when playing on defense. \n\nSniper is an annoying class. As someone who spends most of his time playing Heavy (inb4 n00b), Medic and other Combo classses, I hate sniper and Spy. However, they have their place in the game even though I don't like them.

We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is a net loss. I understand that an argument can be made to the effect that these children grow up to be geniuses, and great innovators. However this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. It is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next Einstein or Trump. They also are just unlikely to be the next Unabomber or sociopath.  \n* Children that die of hereditary diseases usually will have not procreated before their death. Although genetic defects are not preventable, eliminating individuals which carry a higher risk of passing the trait to their child will improve the overall gene pool of our species. Look at the Black Plague. Northern Europeans are more resistant to infections now as their ancestors were able to survive the epidemic.\n* Ends unnecessary suffering. The child won't have to suffer anymore, as they are dead now. \n* I want to point out that public dollars should not be spent on treating the child. If they parents want to go broke trying to keep their precious child alive on the respirator, then go ahead and let them. Poor families can seek donations to cover the cost. Donators receive the \"warm glow\" associated with donating to a good cause. Healthcare expenditure increases, and with it GDP. Its better for the economy in the short run. Governments would have to reduce spending on other government projects, increase sources of tax revenue, or go in debt to cover the large healthcare costs if public dollars were used. \n* Letting the child die helps with population control. Malthus may have been wrong in the 1800's when he proclaimed the doom of humanity as he predicted the growth of humanity would outstrip our ability to grow agriculture. Because of climate change, and the overuse of farmlands we may reach that point in the near future. \n \nFurther information:\n\nExamples of diseases or ailments.\n\u2022Congenital Anomalies\n\u2022Malignant Neoplasms\n\u2022Heart Disease\n\u2022Cancers which meet the definition below.\n\u2022Live disease\n\nDiseases associated with high mortality rates and high treatment costs\n\n\n\n\nThanks for the comments. I think I have critically changed a lot of my view. I haven't gone full circle, but I have been given enough to consider thinking my stance more.\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nYour entire argument sees human life from an instrumental perspective.  If life were just dollars and cents followed by investments for more dollars and cents then your argument would be pretty ironclad.  \n\nBut what if government's role is *not* to mimic business?  Instead government intends to create sustainable societies where all members have an opportunity for a life worth living.  The thing about that statement is that *all members* means **all members**.  \n\nIf life has not just an instrumental value, but an intrinsic value then it is our duty to protect it.  Inversely if life only has instrumental value, then we do not need to protect it in other senses either.  If it's cheaper to send 40x as many soldiers as it is to build better weapons then we just throw soldiers at the problem.  If it's cheaper to threaten the lives of workers than to demand that they wear protective gear then we just throw people into the machine.\n\nMost people would agree that life itself has a value.  You are attempting to draw the line at the types of lives which have value while disregarding the rest in some sort of culling. \nSecond Reply:\nAll of your points are rooted in a broadly utilitarian philosophy, which holds that whichever action increases utility is the morally correct one to make - in the case of your argument, it is mainly economic utility. It fails to take into account a number of things. Firstly, there is another definition of 'utility' - the maximisation of pleasure. Letting sick children die is an exercise in cold pragmatism, and not an action (or consequence of deliberate inaction, more specifically) that anyone would relish or enjoy. There is undeniable value in allowing and encouraging a society to feel good about itself, and failure to take that into account would result in a society that has less esteem in itself, and therefore a society that functions less efficiently, and is more likely to descend into dysfunction. Indeed, Jeremy Bentham, considered the founder of modern utilitarianism, said that, \"it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong\". And while your suggestions would probably provide a small economic boost, this does not make up for the inevitable loss of happiness that such actions would cause.\n\nTo look outside of utilitarian philosophy, I would also hold that your suggestion runs contrary to the entire point of government, which is look after its citizens, to safeguard their lives and livelihoods. A government should - and most, thankfully, do, to at least some extent - look after the needs of its most vulnerable citizens, *regardless of whether or not this is of any economic benefit*. Taking a ruthlessly pragmatic approach to the lives and well-being of the citizens in their care is not the mark of a functional government trying to foster a stable society, but of a government trying to trim society down to its bare, self-sustainable bones - in other words, not a government trying to its best for the people, but a government trying to make itself obsolete in one of the most brutal ways possible. \n\nAs for your Malthusian argument, I think the number of sick children being kept alive in the ways you describe is low enough to have a negligible effect on the total human population.

The rest of us have just become too polite of a society and other people who are affected by the bad behavior or might be injured in cases where the kid is throwing things, biting and kicking other people should be justified in disciplining a misbehaving child in a way that doesn't cause welts. Just a few instances of getting knocked on his butt by a complete stranger should be enough to get it through the kid's head that this is not something you do in public.\nFirst Reply:\nAs a parent of two young children (2 1/2 and 4), I know that children can be highly unpredictable if their routine is broken. In a perfect world, I'd have my youngest in bed by 7:15 and oldest in bed by 9. That isn't always possible with life events (car is breaks down, need to wait by the repair shop, only place within walking distance for children is a family restaurant because they need to be fed. Or you're out for an extended family dinner, or whatever). \n\nI personally remove my children from the situation/area on the rare occurrences they pitch a major fit in public. I also get very annoyed with parents who ignore their kids in public places when they pull that shit. \n\nA customer, however, do not know the entire circumstances or get to dictate to me how I deal with my children. If I'm alone with my two children and one is having a meltdown in a restaurant, I need to get the second child at the table packed up to leave as well. If he's covered in food, that means a quick cleanup. He's likely to get pissed I'm taking him away from his food unexpectedly, and won't understand as he's 2. So now I might have two kids melting down. I might need to locate a staff member to tell them I'm not bailing on the bill or food, just stepping out to calm one of the kids down. This can take a couple minutes while I'm trying to keep the one having a meltdown calm. If you as a customer get antsy while this is happening and hit my kid, I'll punch your teeth out.\n\nNot to mention there can be extenuating circumstances. I have friends with young children that have mild developmental and mental disorders that can make their behavior unpredictable. They're capable of leading semi-independent lives and their doctor/child therapist recommendations are to get the kids out and with others to start adjusting them to different situations. You have no idea if the kid is on the autism spectrum, and hitting them is the worst thing you can do.\nSecond Reply:\nHitting someone else is never \"justified\".  Even if it causes their life to improve 500 times over you can't just hit people because you don't like what they are doing. Especially a child could be horrified of going outside in future thinking someone 10 times their size might just hit them to the ground when they're doing something. \n\nBut verbally scolding them or telling them what they are doing is bad is fine in my eyes, but of course the mother/father will rightly so be angry you're going to upset their child. I highly doubt there would be many situations when the parent would feel happy you're treating their child bad. But you can let them be mad, you're..In theory..Doing the right thing, if you can take a bit of verbal abuse back at yourself and brush it off then go for it. Tell them to stop doing what they are doing and act properly. \n\n\nIf there's a kid on the floor a waiter should speak up and ask \"who's child is this?\" and if they refuse to make him behave they should be removed from the restaurant. \n\n\n\n\nBasically I think your idea is fine but you'd be going about it wrong.  You should watch the movie whiplash, it has that kind of abusive relationship to force someone to do what they should be doing. I think you might like that, plus it's a good movie.\n\n If you watch that movie you might be able to see how the child would be feeling in that situation, doing something wrong and being scolded over and over until you finally get it right is a very hard process and most likely won't work unless the person wants to change or is forced to.  Most children will grow out of it and understand what they are doing is wrong once they're forced into a school where behaving normal would be enforced properly, until then it'll mostly be up to the parents.  Your efforts at trying to change them could work amazingly, but most probably be a waste of time. The best you can do is get them to be removed and explain politely to the parents they need to control their child. \n\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Critics say that people shouldn't care about the lion because of all kinds of issues from racism to abortion. I haven't really followed the lion thing, that was just an example. People do this in all sorts of conversations. \n\nI find this reasoning completely flawed. Are we only going to care about the most important issue? Before we care/talk about something do we have to make sure there is no issue more important?  Also, the conversation about X is already happening. The issue is out in the open and people are passionate about solving it. This is great and a bit rare. We should roll with it when people want to make positive change instead of making them feel bad for being passionate about the wrong thing.  People have the capacity to care about more than one issue. Humanity as a whole can work together to solve more than one problem at once. Saying something like this you are trying to derail the argument about X  rather than help either argument.\n\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nIt doesn't take an expert to spot the flaw in that sort of argument. It is an informal fallacy, called \"appeal to worse problems\". There are many reasons why it does not work, you have named several.\n\nHowever, as with many fallacies, the idea behind it has merit. All problems are not equal. Devoting time, effort, money, etc. to lesser problems at the expense of larger ones is undesirable, all else being equal. What's important is whether one can provide good reasons why one issue should take precedence over another, and to what degree.\nSecond Reply:\nThe reason people are complaining about the killing of the lion taking up so much airspace is this: there is a finite amount of time in a day, and therefore a finite amount of time that one can spend watching/reading/hearing about/talking about news. People are not really mad that we're talking about Cecil's killing in the wake of the deaths of people like Sandra Bland and Samuel Dubose. People are made that we're talking about Cecil's killing **at the expense of** talking about the deaths of people like Sandra Bland and Samuel Dubose.\n\nNobody's arguing that the lion's death isn't tragic. People are arguing that the lion's death is not so tragic that it's worth completely ignoring yet more examples of not only police brutality but straight-up lies told by the police to cover that brutality up. We want positive change, sure, but it's good to prioritize.\n\nYou say that \"people have the capacity to care about more than one issue.\" This is true. However, people also only have a finite capacity to care about issues in general. When certain issues are shoved far enough out of the spotlight in favor of - quite frankly - more important ones, these issues stop being cared about enough to actually effect change.\n\nTl;dr: it's not that we shouldn't care about \"less important\" issues, it's that we have a finite amount of time and space and mental energy to care about issues in general. Therefore, we should apportion appropriately and not give undue attention to an issue which is not as important."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Acronyms that are not initialisms are pronounced like they are words of their own, which brings me to point 2:\n\n* \"It's pronounced like 'gift' because that's the only other word with 'gif'!\" by that logic, due to the existence of the word 'girth', 'giraffe' would be pronounced with a hard g. 'Gift' is the exception not the rule. See; [here](http://www.theschoolhouse.us/lessons/lesson53.html). To base the pronunciation of a word on an exception is highly illogical.\n\n* \"The dictionary says both pronunciations are fine!\" The dictionary also says that 'literally' means both literally and not literally. See; [here](http://theweek.com/articles/466957/how-wrong-definition-literally-sneaked-into-dictionary). This is because the dictionary typically reflects how words are used, not what is correct. So if people started pronouncing epitome like its spelled, the dictionary would also likely say that the incorrect pronunciation is fine there, too. This does not, however, make the pronunciation correct.\n\nSo without further ado, Change My View!\n\nFirst Reply:\ni mean the person who made .gif has said it's pronounced jif but that's the thing isn't it? jif is pronounced jif. we already have a spelling for that sound that brooks no arguments so it makes more sense for gif to be a different sound (with a hard g)\n\nif you wanted to spell gif as in gift how else would you spell it? an italian would write ghif to be fair, but i think most people would just write gif\n\ngi- having a j sound is a rule in romance languages. giraffe in italian is giraffa. our word for giraffe is based on this and so follows the same rules. the words that aren't based off romance languages follow different rules (these are the ones like gift and girth) and we didn't get .gif from italy so why should we use italian pronunciation for it? \n\n(note i'm using italian and not french/spanish in my examples because i'm familiar with italian. french/spanish may have different pronunciations (i forget tbh) but there is a separate gi- sound as opposed to ga- (or go- or gu-) in each of the languages)\nSecond Reply:\nLanguage is one debate that is not exclusively grounded in structure.  The *English* language slaps structure in the face and laughs.\n\nThe pronunciation or acceptance of a new word just come down to use.  How many people say one *vs* how many say another.  While the original, intended pronunciation for the word by it's creator was jiff the average person interprets it as gift minus t.  We *could* argue the *why* of it, but it is moot.  Once the word is used that way in mass, it is accepted into the dictionary and becomes correct - whether it was that way or not previously.\n\nKeep in mind that the function that language serves is to communicate more easily.  If rules conflict with that priority, they hurt the language.  Rules are instead made to *help* that agenda. So if people are naturally inclined to pronounce something one way, it would be counterproductive to enforce the opposite."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

While stationary, the only non-malicious use of a car's headlights (I.E. other than parking the car and turning on the headlights/high beams in an attempt to confuse or blind oncoming drivers) is to light up an area for somebody on foot. However, a flashlight would be much more effective for this purpose.\n\nWith the lack of usefulness of stationary headlights in mind, cars should be designed such that the headlights turn off when the car is turned off in order to prevent the car battery from running down.\n\n\nDeltas:\n\n* [Always-on behavior in addition to auto-off behavior](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3ffta7/cmv_auto_manufacturers_should_make_their_vehicles/cto7tnn?context=1)\n* [Headlights on a timer](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3ffta7/cmv_auto_manufacturers_should_make_their_vehicles/cto8c9k?context=3)\n* [Stopping on the side of a country road in low visibility conditions](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3ffta7/cmv_auto_manufacturers_should_make_their_vehicles/cto8zsu?context=3)\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nAt least one manufacturer, Volvo, does this already, and solves both the manual control and the vehicle visibility issues:\n\n- When the headlight switch is set to the normal mode, the lights go off when the car is turned off. This saves your battery in the most common case. \n- But, if the key is turned to ACC (accessories powered, radio and windows work, motor is off), the headlights will remain on. This must be intentional, since you must leave the key in the ignition. \n- If the headlight switch is set to parking/\"driving\" lamp mode (dimmer indicator lights only, *illegal* to use at any time while the vehicle is moving), the parking lights will remain on when the car is fully off/key removed. This lets you leave lower wattage lights on for visibility, and should never be something you drive with and then forget, since it's illegal to drive with these lights on. \n\nSecond Reply:\nI drive an 06 Fusion.\n\nI have a dial to the left of my steering wheel to control the headlight behaviour.  \n\nIf I leave 'em in auto they turn off about 30 seconds after the engine turns off.  I can turn the dial to drive in the dark, or turn them on when the car is off.\n\nSeems like the best solution.

The Committee could invest in large stadiums that have an actual purpose after being used for the Olympic Games, namely, the next Olympic Games.\n\nFurthermore, and this is just speculation, this would allow Greece to reap the benefits of the economic surplus generated by the Games.\n\nFirst Reply:\n&gt; Organizing the Olympic games is financially ruinous\n\nIs it really?\n\nThe Barcelona olympics is credited for transforming a decaying city into a tourist magnet.\n\nThe London games were used to develop East London, Vancouver to build infrastructure.  They were successful and the infrastructure benefits have paid for their costs long term, even if they all had a couple unnecessary temporary facilities.  \n\nBeijing *did* do a lot to clean up the city, even if you don't trust their numbers.  The Atlanta &amp; Sydney games are probably a wash in terms of cost/benefit, depending on whom you ask.\n\n&gt;  blatantly wasteful \n\nThat's not to say all have been successful.  Sochi was a mess of epic proportions.  Montreal, Nagano, and Lake Placid were bad too... all of them badly overestimated future tourism and growth of their host cities.\n\nI'm not sure how far back in time you want to go.\n\nThe games can be beneficial, and they can be money pits.  It really comes down to management. \n\n&gt; I think the Olympic Games should be held in Greece every four years\n\nYou are aware that the Athens games were among the most mismanaged and over budget ever, right?\n\n&gt;  this would allow Greece to reap the benefits of the economic surplus generated by the Games\n\nI'm not sure we need to further enable Greece to be financially irresponsible and devoid of a real economy.  As it is now, a pretty huge amount of their income comes from tourism.\n\n&gt; Similar to the financial organization of the UN, all International Olympic Committee members should pay according to their ability. \n\nThe UN is an open dialog... and that's about it.  The UN does have increased status (security council, etc) for the top countries that are footing the bill.\n\nThe Olympics, OTOH, are mostly a feel good event - but they are a moneymaker.  Keeping them in one location isn't very inclusive or in spirt with the games.\n\nIt seems more likely to me that cities will just become wiser about not overspending.  We're already seeing that in the 2024 bid with Boston backing out, and a wiser LA-SF plain instead.\nSecond Reply:\nIt would certainly be economically reasonable to do something like this, but I don't think other countries would want to fund it and it could reduce the appeal of the games.\n\nThe problem is that the other nations will have even less reason to fund someone *else's* financially ruinous and blatantly wasteful Olympics than their own. Like a lot of sporting events it is a prestige thing (which is part of why those corrupt regimes want it), and there isn't a good reason to pay for someone else's prestige. While you would certainly save money with reusing the infrastructure it will still be expensive, as you will need to be maintaining stuff far beyond was is necessary locally between each games. Other countries won't have an incentive to pay for extra blatantly wasteful pageantry and extravagance, so keeping everything sparkly new like currently happens would be unlikely.\n\nIt may also hurt the appeal of the games. Won't you please think of the puff pieces? You know, the incessant hours of talking about the planning, design, and pitfalls of the event itself, then sending a reporter to ooh and aah over the most \"exotic\" aspects of the local culture and cuisine? The wild new arena designs, ridiculous attempts to outdo each other, national rivalries with the host city, and general amount of stuff to cover and build hype over is going to go down a lot if you just do them in the same locations in Greece over and over.

This is obviously not to say that there is no longer rock music being made, that that music is never popular, or that that contemporary rock music isn't good. But rock has become similar to jazz and classical\u2014while there is still lots of it being made, it's not a powerful cultural force any more. The modern cultural conversation is being played out in hip-hop and EDM.\n\nOf the current Top 10 on the Billboard charts, the only rock single is \"Shut Up and Dance\" by Walk the Moon, at #9, and that song is heavily influenced by EDM. The current Song of the Summer is generally agreed to be Fetty Wap's \"Trap Queen.\" The most consistently popular rock band currently is probably either the Foo Fighters, a band that has been around since the late 90s and still plays a very similar style of music to what they were playing then (and arguably still owe a large portion of their popularity to nostalgia for Nirvana, a band whose largest cultural moment was 24 years ago), or the Black Keys, a band playing with a deliberately retro style. \n\nTame Impala and Arcade Fire, two bands that have been lauded for their innovation in the rock genre have on their most recent albums embraced EDM influences, and largely moved away from guitar-based rock. \n\nI would argue that the most culturally important albums of the past few months have been outside of rock\u2014Kendrick Lamar's *To Pimp A Butterfly*, Drake's *If You're Reading This It's Too Late*, Mark Ronson's *Uptown Special*, Taylor Swift's *1989* (in which she ditched her country roots for an embrace of EDM pop).\n\nThere has been a lot of rock music recently that has been great too (Father John Misty, Courtney Barnett, Colleen Green, and Jim O'Rourke have all released albums I have absolutely loved, and I just listened to the new Titus Andronicus album yesterday) but that has become an exception, and as my examples point out, it's not really commercially popular or culturally relevant beyond a small core. \n\nI don't have a real problem with rock losing its cultural cachet. I love rap, R&amp;B, and electronica as well, and think that there is a lot of great innovation going on in modern music (and even that 2015 is an all-time stand-out year). But I think that rock has lost its importance in the wider culture, and that rock music is now even imbued with an inherent feeling of throwback, the way that jazz now makes people think of a certain time period even as jazz continues to innovate to this day.\n\nFirst Reply:\nIMO, rock - especially modern metal - is more \"culturally\" relevant than ever before. But it's more relevant to a different demographic; people who are connoisseurs of music and the like. It's the same move that jazz and blues made when rock became dominant in the '50s and '60s. \n\nThe music of the masses is now hip hop, EDM and stuff like that. But stuff like metal and punk are no longer seen as lowbrow. Highbrow metal bands such as Opeth, Agalloch and Mastodon are reaching out more to college-educated audiences, like art-rock did back in the day. \nSecond Reply:\nI think it only looks that way in retrospect and rock only looks culturally irrelevant compared to an embellished past. Look back at the heyday of punk or prog rock or thrash metal and you'll see it was largely some version of pop that dominated the charts. Pop-punk, grunge and nu metal were largely short-lived trends (from a mainstream exposure standpoint.) Rock has always had one foot firmly in the underground, which is why its descent into irrelevance has been proclaimed in every decade. Most rock bands reach their commercial peak late in their career. Bands like Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Rush and Iron Maiden weren't critical darlings at the time of their most classic albums."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Life is fundamentally shit, but happiness is possible.\nFirst Reply:\nI'll address each of your points.\n\n&gt; #1 Boredom is the default mood. Mere existence isn't enough to satisfy us, we constantly have to distract ourselves from boredom.\n\nI disagree. Humans are pack animals. If you are with your \"clan\" (friends, family, etc), you should not be bored. Most humans find enjoyment simply from being around people they like. If you do not, then you are in the minority. If you are alone, then you will feel boredom. This is because humans are not meant to be secluded.\n\n&gt; #2 Pleasure requires effort, suffering does not. I literally don't have to do anything to suffer from boredom and starvation.\n\nI disagree as well. For me, pleasure comes easily. I will talk to a stranger and get pleasure, listen to a song and get pleasure, eat a nice meal and get pleasure. There isn't much effort I'm putting in. When I'm not putting in effort, I don't feel suffering. If you have a good 2-3 hours of pleasure, 1-2 hours of alone-time shouldn't make you fail pain. Food is also easy to come by nowadays and is in abundance. That's not an issue, so it's worthless to discuss.\n\n&gt; #3 Suffering is more powerful feeling than pleasure. Is there an opposite to a cluster headache\n\nIn my opinion, you underrate pleasure. If your mother dies, you feel immense suffering. That's not because the value of human life weighs so much on your soul that you can't bare to see a person die. It's because of the all the pleasure that person brought you. You feel pain, because you miss the pleasure.\n\nIt's the same thing with a cluster headache. You underrate the good feeling of having a clear head and feeling \"normal\". Cluster headaches hurt so much because normal feelings are so good. With normal feelings in your head, you can come up with amazing ideas, formulas, etc that make you feel immense joy. You take that for granted.\n\n&gt; #4 The universe doesn't care about how we feel. No one is protecting us. If I'm falling onto spikes, universe is not gonna pull me away and protect me, no matter how hard I pray.\n\nThe universe is not some sentient being with feelings. Saying that the universe doesn't care about you falling onto spikes is the same as saying the playground didn't care that you broke your arm while on the slide. The universe doesn't have feelings. Dying is a part of life. It is the equal to birth. Birth is the best thing that can happen to you and death is the worst. Sure, you could wish you were never alive to have never felt suffering, but at the same time, you would never have felt joy.\n\nI suggest you\n\n1. Read \"The Giver\". It's a children's book, but it's fantastic and tells a story based on your theories.\n\n2. See a psychologist. You seemingly suffer from depression or anxiety which is fixable.\nSecond Reply:\nSuffering isn't the default, doing stuff is. \n\nMillions of years ago, we did shit to survive. We hunted wooly mammoths and looked for berries and stuff. \n\nAs time went on we discovered farming and we settled down, so we didn't need to do as much so we had more free time but we still had needs like shelter and friendship so we kept doing shit. \n\nFast forward to 2015, we still need to do shit but not as much. Exercise is an option not a fact of life. We don't need to look for berries we got Safeway, we don't need to kill a pig found in the wild, we just buy pork. We don't need to build a home we just rent it. We don't even need to go to a friends house or hear their voice to talk , we got texting, Facebook ect. \n\nMy point is that it is not the default to be bored, we have just been spoiled as a species.

This is because for the most part it's not a question of \"can the candidate perform a task?\" It's a question of \"what will happen if they do?\" Consider the following possible scenarios:\n\nRepublican and democratic candidates hop into the \"great recession simulator\". Republican candidate responds by cutting taxes and removing regulations. Democrat responds by bailouts and expanding g the safety net. Unless the simulator can actually evaluate the impact those policies, it's no better than a debate question.\n\nThen they hop in the \"Iran is about to get a nuclear bomb\" simulator. They both draft potential agreements to put forth to Iran and other countries. What now? Can the simulator say if that deal will be accepted? Can it evaluate if the deal is enforceable? Again, it's the results that are interesting, and if the simulator can't deliver them it's just an expensive interview question.\n\nMaybe I'm just thinking about this the wrong way though. Can you give an example of what this would look like in practice? \nSecond Reply:\nWhat an interesting proposition!\n\n* **Why would nominees sign up for this?**\n\nAs far as I can tell, this method is far more likely to highlight the shortcoming of a candidate's abilities than the standard debates. I can't see any candidates (except the fringe ones) being masochistic enough for something like this. An additional problem is that since they're on camera, they still wouldn't behave the way they would in a real situation. They know this, and so do we.\n\n* **Reliance on media**\n\nThe WaPo article still stresses that it'll be the journalists who analyze the simulation results for everyone else. How does that remove the ideological bias that's present in the current system? The Democratic supporters would get their analysis from a liberal source, while the Republican supporters would still choose their own source. It's still NPR vs. Fox, just a step removed.\n\n* **Evaluation of successful simulation**\n\nThis is a big one. A lot of these situations would have to deal with emergency scenarios, not long-term matters. So perhaps it would be useful to see how a candidate handles a shooting at an Army base, but it tells us nothing about their ability to negotiate with Iran. It would favour those who can handle emergencies better, while possibly ignoring the more diplomat-type candidates.\n\nThat took a while to write up..."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

This is a tough one, because I do believe a woman shouldn't be socially pressured into taking her's husband's last name, and gay spouses also have a conundrum of their own. \n\nHowever, I think that a family should have a family name, because otherwise you are choosing to make everyone else's life difficult. One small example is if you work in an industry where you deal with a lot of names and families and meeting people blind (like I do). It's helpful to know in advance who is related to who by just looking at a piece of paper.\n\nBUT, if the wife and the husband choose not to share a last name, please God settle on one name for your kid. Just flip a coin for which last name your kid takes if that's what you need to do. Don't make everyone around him have to deal with saying and writing out Reginald Henry Lieberman-Montgomery. \n\nA metaphor I would make for this would be gender pronouns. You have the right to tell me whether you identify as a man or a woman, but I swear to God if you insist that everyone around you refer to you strictly with the gender neutral pronouns Ni, Nem and Nir, I will be having none of it. \n\nAs a counterpoint, I will say that I can't ever imagine myself taking my wife's last name. And if she chose not to take mine, I think I would feel a little disappointed. Further, I can't imagine feeling comfortable with my kid not taking my last name. So I already recognize a bit of the hypocrisy. In that way, I see that I am posing a problem without an apparent solution. On top of your rebuttals, I would also be curious to hear alternative ideas/social structures that could work to level the playing field, AND prevent me from having to say a mouthful. \n\n\nApologies for the day long delay-- car emergency took all night and all morning.\n\nThanks for all your responses! Here are some of my views you've changed. \n\nSpain &gt; 'Murica. There's a clear system in place in Spanish countries that actually speaks to my \"one family name\" point. People consistently take the fathers, then mother's surname. Then the kid's kids will do the same. Gives you family history and also something to put on your mailbox. \n\nWhat I personally like about this is that it's uniform. If two last names were adopted country-wide in America, I would have much less of a problem with it. \n\nI also want to clarify: My problem with the \"mouthful\" of hyphenated last names does not mean that I would also suggest gentrifying the Krzyzewskis and the Chevaprevadumrongs of the world. To shorten your family name is to bastardize it. No ill feelings to those with shortened last names of course-- my last name was actually gentrified two generations ago. \n\nFinally, here is a post that very well summarizes my American sentiments: \n\n\n\nMy American sensibilities that shorter is better are deeply ingrained and will probably be there 'til I die. That said, at least I can recognize them so that I know to keep them in check. \n\nWhile I will continue to make fun of people who have two last names, it will be with the same conviction that I make fun of everyone else. No hostility here.\n\nThanks guys!\nFirst Reply:\n&gt; However, I think that a family should have a family name, because otherwise you are choosing to make everyone else's life difficult.

My mom kept her last name and it has never been a problem in 30 years.\n\n&gt; However, I think that a family should have a family name, because otherwise you are choosing to make everyone else's life difficult. \n\nWhat about people with very confusing names? I'd say the name Smith-Jones is much easier to say than something Krzyzewski. Does someone with a confusing last name owe it to us to choose a more traditional last name?\nSecond Reply:\nI think it's useful to be able to identify a family on the basis of last names, and so I think it's useful for everyone to share the same label.\n\nAnd this is exactly why hyphenation is such a useful thing. If you meet a group of people who share the last name \"Montegue-Capulet\" then you immediately understand that they are a family unit, and you also understand something about the ancestry from both sides of the family. Additionally, hyphenation also scores points for upholding some form of gender equality.\n\nOf course, it's impractical to expect people's names to grow exponentially in size with every generation - but this doesn't have to be a problem- it's easy to resolve: when someone gets married, the son keeps only the father's name and the daughters keep only the mother's - and then they hyphenate with their spouse. We can also adopt the convention that the man's name always comes first in the hyphenation - even better - now we know both their family ties and ancestry (I don't care about how it's ordered, we just need to decide).\n\nIn summary, it only takes three names (one first, two last) to identify a person, their family unit, their family ties, and their ancestry in a complete and fair way.  Saying two last names does take longer than one, but last names are only really used for official purposes, and under formal situations. And - people are already hyphenating. I figure we may as well adopt that system as efficiently and informatively as possible."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Marginally better gas mileage may be an incentive as well. High end luxury sport car manufacturers can argue that the coupe offers better aerodynamics/lower weight to improve performance and handling.Today, coupes cost the same if not more than the same model sedan. I don't believe a slimmer profile can noticeably improve performance in an economy 140HP car, similarly, I find the fuel economy improvement from 30 to 32 mpg hard to justify the loss of two doors at the same price.\n\n \nAutomatic transmission performance used to be inferior to manuals, and an expert could handle a car with manual significantly better than an auto. Today, the highest performance cars come with automatics, and manual often isn't an option anymore. Even in models that offer both, the 0-60 and quarter mile speed is quite a bit better in the automatic, which offers \"manual shifting\" anyways. \n\nI believe that their long history and inferior counterparts has created a aura of superiority over automatics, similar to the Stradivarius violins. Due to production quantities, a manual transmission costs the same as automatic if not more.\n\nThis leaves me with only a few situations where one would practically want a coupe:\n\nHigh end 400-500+ HP sportscars which accelerate and go fast enough that the profile and marginal weight makes a difference.\n\nAnd for manual transmission:\n\nOld classic imitation cars for the nostalgia? They're plainly under performing now.\n\nWhenever I see a Bentley or Benz S550/600 coupe, I cringe a bit since they're very obviously not performance based cars. \n\nManual freaks who refuse to own any other cars also seem illogical as hell. \n\nAny thoughts?\n\n\nPlease leave the footnote below the following line, but remember to delete this sentence by replacing it with the body of your post. Thank you!\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nSomething about a footnote at the the end of your post but delete it?Were you meaning to leave a line for us to copy and paste to show that we read your whole argument before responding?\n\nAnyways:\n\nI prefer manual transmission. I get some people don't like shifting in traffic or whatever, and that's fine for you. But I learned and grew up on one so it really is second nature and makes absolutely zero more conscious effort for me. Benefits of the manual:\n\n- Better gas mileage, no question if you actually know how to drive a stick.\n\n- More control over the car. Going up on down a mountain? Change to the gear you're most comfortable in based on what the slope is doing at the time. Erratic traffic pattern? Pop to a different gear when you need a quick jump to sneak between cars. In the auto the car decides what you need and is based pretty much just on RPM not letting you do those control things.\n\n- Downshifting is mechanically easier on your car than breaking\n\n- Manual transmissions tend to have a longer life and are easier/cheaper to repair because they are simpler \n\n- \"Oh, honey, sure I'd et you take my car, it's not that yoour a bad driver and I love my car more than I love ou it's that you don't know how to drive a stick.\" ^^^^^^^It's ^^^^^^^just ^^^^^^^a ^^^^^^^joke ^^^^^^^^^people\n\nAs for the super performance cars coming with automatic these days I can't speak as to if they're really better that way or not since I can't say I've driven an Aston Martin or such lately. But I know on your average car that your average person is likely to buy (I currently drive a '15 Passat TDI) performance is better with stick. Perhaps auto gets better when you enter super car land but the vast majority of us will never know that.\n\nBesides,  everyone knows you look cooler driving a stick. And the first thing any new car buyer asks themselves is,, \"Will this car help get me laid.\" ^^^^^^^again ^^^^^^^just ^^^^^^^jokes ^^^^^^^folks\nSecond Reply:\nHere's a small list:\n\n* I like how manuals handle much better than automatics. I feel more in control of the car. \n\n* Manuals can get better marginally better gas mileage on some cars. \n\n* Another point that is kinda tongue-in-cheek is that not a lot of people know how to drive stick so your car is less likely to get stolen. \n\n* Engine braking can extend the life on your brakes significantly. \n\n* Manual ~~engines~~ transmissions are simpler and easier to maintain. \n\n* Another I forgot originally, You can pop the clutch if your battery dies. (or your alternator is on the fritz)\n\nHonestly, to me, driving stick is much more enjoyable than with an automatic which is why I prefer it.\n\nedit: fixed typos and added last item"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Google translate may have its hiccups, but I can understand the majority of its translations and it's only going to get better over the next few years.\n\nI understand that most universities (at least in the US) require some time spent in a foreign language class, but this is really part of what I am arguing against. Most people I have ever taken a foreign language class with resented being there and putting in years of effort to learn a skill they might only use a couple times in their whole life, and will likely forget.\n\nObviously people in some careers, like diplomats or aid workers, need to learn another language, but I just don't see how the average person will spend enough time with people who don't speak their language, in a place without an interpreter or internet access, to justify the amount of time spent learning a language.\n\n*I am excepting English from this because so much of the Internet is available only in English.\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nThere are plenty of studies regarding the mental benefits of learning a second language. It is good for the brain of the person doing the learning to learn another language because it allows that person to express themselves in new ways and with new people. It also shows an appreciation for other cultures to take the time to learn and speak their native languages with them when/if you are visiting them. While it may not be as \"worth it\" for someone who has no intentions to ever travel to another country to learn a new language, if you do any international travel, just trying to speak the native language, even if you butcher it, is appreciated by the native people. Just think, if a foreign person came to your town and started to talk to you in broken English, would you be mad that they didn't take the time to fully learn your language? Or would you be appreciative that they are even trying and help them with what they're asking? Now, extend that to someone with a phone out in front of them. Would you be as willing to help someone who is speaking into their phone and thrusting it at you to read what they're trying to get across?\nSecond Reply:\nThere are several benefits that come from learning a second (or third or more) language beyond the ability to converse in the new language. Specifically, language learning has been shown to have measurable cognitive benefits: \n\n* There is research that indicates [\"that those who spoke two or more languages had significantly better cognitive abilities compared to what would have been expected from their baseline test.\"](http://www.bbc.com/news/health-27634990).

I think in terms of actually being useful to users, it would be nice to have some kind of flagging system for this. My main gripe is that all these sites just show you faces and user names, and you don't really know that these people aren't interested until you've already been drawn in.*\n___\n*This is based on my experience over about 4-6 months of casually using Tinder and OkC, if that helps you form any counter arguments or gives any perspective. Also, this isnt about poly relationships looking for another partner, the scope of my view doesn't even approach that.*\n\nSomething I've noticed with slightly surprising frequency on dating sites are profiles that have one of the following kinds of statements- \"Looking for friends, no commitments.\", \"My husband/boyfriend knows I have this to make friends, and I'm not going to cheat so don't bother\", \"I just moved here and thought this would be a good way to make some friends\", \"I don't take this seriously, I'm just here for the laughs, really not looking for a relationship\" ... etc...\n\nPersonally, I feel these kinds of profiles don't belong on dating sites, and only serve to come off as disingenuous or disappointing. Most dating sites just give you a series of profile pictures and names, and you choose which ones you find attractive to open up and read. The image draws you in, and then the \"Just for friends\" lets you down. To me, this is like someone attending a speed dating night at a singles bar, someone finds them very attractive and wants to see about striking up a relationship, and then they say \"Oh I only came here to maybe find some friends and enjoy people trying too hard\". If you're really looking for friends, there are places designed for platonic relationships- in the context of online communities there's places like subreddits for local towns, there's meetup.com, there's plenty of public Facebook groups for all kinds of interests, etc... \n\nGoing to a place specifically marketed to and called a dating app is just disingenuous. I wouldn't go to Ashley Madison if I just wanted to get a platonic shoe shopping buddy. \n\nFirst Reply:\nWhat about people who value friendship more highly than other aspects of a relationship, and want to start on that basis? What if they're looking for someone who wants to be friends first, and in a committed relationship second, and they expect that if they find the right person, it'll evolve into a committed relationship.\n\nYou can say, and I may agree, that this is the wrong way to go about looking for love, but why would it be fair to exclude people from the dating site just because they have a different way of going about things?\n\nI mean, couldn't you take it in the other direction and say that people only looking for casual sex shouldn't be on those sites, since they're ostensibly for dating and not hookups, and there are other places for hookups they can go?\nSecond Reply:\nLet me use OKC as a point of reference because it is what I am most familiar with.\n\nI agree with you that when someone is ONLY looking for friends, it feels disappointing. I mean, why are you here, then? But, OKC lets you select \"new friends\" **as well as** \"long-term/short-term relationship/casual sex/etc.\" I've been on dates with girls who have told me that they like meeting new people and aren't adverse to remaining friends with a date that doesn't mesh romantically or sexually with them. I think the absence of a \"new friends\" preference is meant to be telling: they absolutely do not want to interact with you unless sex or a relationship is on the table.\n\nIn other words, when combined with other options, it says something about the openess of the person to different kinds of relationships. That says something about a person, to me. It is only when their preference is *exclusively* \"new friends\" that it is annoying. But I would be more inclined to date someone who had \"new friends\" in addition to other things because I feel like it makes them seem less desperate (but that's just me)."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Perhaps my view comes from the women I am surrounded by, which is quite a small sample size. I look forward to hearing another point of view.\n\nMy main points:\n\n1.) Physically.  Men dominate sports and physical events.  I can't think of one sport that women are better than men at, in general, and if there are a few, that's only a few, and men dominate the rest. \n\n2.) In the work place.  This is the most controversial part.  Women want equal pay, but from what I've seen in my limited 8 years in industry, is that women are not as good as men at their jobs.  My industry is oil refining.  99% of the plant workers are men, why?  I work in the Engineering office.  There are no women engineers, only secretaries, and some of them baffle me at how incompetent they are. (Admittedly our one secretary is excellent at her job, and does far better than I ever could.  But my point here is that a man could do that job just as well.) \n\n3.) At home.  This is where most of my point lies.  It could just be a gender roles thing, but why am I so much better at everything than my girlfriend?  I'm not saying I'm great, but rather most of the girlfriends I've had are completely incompetent at a lot of things.  Things like building an Ikea cabinet, she can't do it.  Small, mundane challenges like un-stacking and re-stacking a sleeve of solo cups.  We had to do it as part of a challenge, and I was much faster at it.  She couldn't figure out how the gear shifters worked on a newer mountain bike after riding it for 10 minutes.  I had never seen this type before, but figured it out in 10 seconds.  Not because I'm clever, but because it is simple and something I believe should be easy for any adult to figure out. \n\nThese reasons are why I hold this view.  I look forward to being completely flamed for this view, and also for another perspective.  Thanks. \n\nFirst Reply:\nI think most of this comes down to exposure.  Because you used your girlfriend(s) as an example, I will use mine current girlfriend to answer all of these points.\n\n1) Physically, men are in general more superior to women.  I am about 6'2\" and 195 pounds and my girlfriend is 5'5\" and most likely 105 pounds (heaven forbid she sees this and actually weighs less).  I am significantly stronger than her but she is a much faster runner than me.\n\n2)In the work place, my girlfriend whoops my ass in this category.  We are actually both engineering students and her GPA is better than mine (and mine is pretty good).  She also is a better and harder worker than me.\n\n3)At home, I would say I am most likely better than my girlfriend.  I am incredible at caring for children and while I am not sure if she how good she is at something like this, I can assure I am better.  She is generally a better cook than me but I am better than her at things like cooking and cleaning.\n\nAll in all, we are pretty split in terms of things we each are better at and these traits span across various categories.  I have an extreme amount of respect for her which is maybe why I am willing to admit some of the things she is better at.\n\nSidenote: My ex girlfriend before her was not as good of an employee, not as intelligent, not as athletic, and not as good at any home tasks as me.  I was better than her in pretty much every sense of the word.\n\nBut like I initially said, I think it all comes down to exposure.\nSecond Reply:\nOK. I'm going to look specifically at your points in turn.\n\n1) **Physical**. Absolutely, men at their peak are stronger and faster than women. But a woman at her peak can be stronger or faster than the vast majority of men; look at [Katrin Tanja Davidsdottir](http://espn.go.com/espnw/athletes-life/article/13337513/katrin-tanja-davidsdottir-plays-mental-game-win-crossfit-games), I'm fairly certain she could take most men on and win. To further expand on your point; so what? So women are on average less strong. I'm not convinced that in the modern developed world this is a huge issue.\n\n2) **Industry**. I really think your experiences have biased you here. [Oil refining is 18% female](http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat18.htm) (actually higher than I expected). This means that there will be default be a higher chance that the 'shining stars' will be male. Some of the issues you've seen are down to culture; we have only recently started to accept women in formerly 'male' lines of work such as engineering, so a lot of women who could perhaps have made excellent engineers would never have thought of it as a career option. As for the women who aren't good at their work- I wonder, do you notice the men who aren't good at their work too?\n\n3) **At home**. This one's awkward. There are a few different possibilities here and, I'll be honest, none of my suggestions make you look good- I hope you don't get too offended. \n\n* First, I noticed that the issues you mentioned were all practical. You're an engineer- that's your bag. So you notice when your girlfriend isn't good at physical things. But I wonder if you've noticed your own failings? Perhaps she's always silently annoyed that you put your foot in it at social gatherings. Maybe you're not very good at art or design. Are these problems, are you possibly less good at them than she is? **Possibly, yes**.  But this is not something for which you should be blamed. They aren't part of your skill-set, but you can learn.\n\n* Perhaps you're impatient. When you were looking at the gear system you used your previous knowledge and applied it to the situation at hand. There's no parallel for your girlfriend; it's the same as asking someone who's only ever driven an automatic car to move to a manual. It's possible, but they will kangaroo down the road for a while before they get the hang of it. \n\nI remember that it was only a few years ago that my mum was terrible with computers. She's an intelligent woman, a teacher, but they weren't her thing. Why? Because she was trying to learn from me, my sister or my dad- all of whom would just say \"oh give it here\" when she was struggling. Our impatience meant she didn't learn. She did a 1-week course and came out knowing everything she needed to know because the teacher there has the patience to let her learn.\n\n* Maybe you date stupid or physically inept women. This is possible; I can imagine that if you show this 'women are stupid' belief in the real world, intelligent women may be less likely to want to spend time with you.\n\n--\n\nSo what does this mean? my TL;DR is that I think you're focussing on things at which you are good, measuring some women against these, then using this to judge women as a whole. \n\nWe could talk about how [more women than men graduate college.](http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/news/story/2012/feb/21/edu-women-overtake-men-in-earning-degrees-at-all/71196/) I could show you that in the [developing world women make up a growing percentage of new entrepreneurs.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/15/female-entrepreneurship_n_1149393.html)\n\nBut I think the most likely argument I can make is about environment. The men you hang out with are engineers. They are likely to be above average intelligence. Depending on where you meet women, they are more likely to be average. A very good friend of mine is an engineer, working for one of the top companies in the world designing airports. I like to think she'd be able to show you a thing or two!"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Likewise, they have the strongest presence as well. The United Kingdom had an equally great presence during its Imperial days, which it more or less managed to retain.\n\nI feel Europe could easily raise its economy to the third power if each current country paid its tax to a single, central government that viewed each part of the union equally, at most... with different strategies, investiture focuses.\n\nThe main counter arguement I see against an united Europe is cultural decay or incompatibility, but I do not understand how it would get in the way too much. Culture won't disappear just because people answer to a single elected government, neither will it disappear due to people wandering within the borders.\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nhow many primary languages are there in the USA? i would say somewhere in the estimate of.... 1.\n\nyou can't do the same for Europe where everything is completely different - money/currency, religions, general lifestyle.\n\nit's also worth noting that having an EU passport means that you can go to those countries with no problems - so it is effectively like one large community anyway, and realistically, has no benefits in changing into an official 'mono-country' effectively.\nSecond Reply:\nIt's worth mentioning that both USA and Russia were taken by force through an era of imperialism.  You are suggesting that countries opt in.  This method - while more civil and required by our modern day, global society - is unlikely to bear fruit.\n\n&gt;  The main counter arguement I see against an united Europe is cultural decay or incompatibility, but I do not understand how it would get in the way too much. \n\n**Language**: [Europe has many languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Europe).  This is an especially large problem when dealing with the law where interpretation of a given case, statement or law is the difference between success and failure.  So if only for the most basic reasons, if you have one country, you need one language to be the primary one.  Which one would it be?  \n\n**Social programs**: Any standard that any country currently set for their social programs is a carefully calibrated balance between what they're willing to spend and who they will spend it on. This means that once the countries are united, *everyone* needs to eliminate their social programs and start over with a much larger country in mind.  This will be *fantastic* for the poor countries that have little to no social safety net.  But this will mean that the bar will be significantly lowered for more lucrative countries.  \n\n**Political Parties**: Each country has it's own political preference.  But more than that, the political systems are not even set up to mean the same things.  So to me, the French Socialist party might seem a lot like the Swedish Social Democrats, but they might be vastly different.  Or the current prime minister of Finland is of the National Coalition Party\t, but outside of Finland, it doesn't really exist.  The point that I'm making is that there is no way for anyone to feel represented in government if they will almost certainly have to give up the type of leadership that they voted for and want.\n\nI could go on, but the picture looks the same across the board.  Any country with something to lose wouldn't want to lose it.  Instead, a separate union similar to the European Union makes sense.  EU has their standards for grouping countries and after the third bailout with Greece, it's unlikely that they will be changing their minds.  So, a separate union for smaller countries would be an incredible point of financial leverage.  Other than that, I find it hard to see how or why any larger country would want to give up what they have.  "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

This essentially means we have lost at this point and there's nothing we can do about it. To launch the nukes at that point becomes an act of revenge accomplishes absolutely nothing for anyone. \n\n2: To launch these nukes hurts innocent people in whatever country attacked us who likely had no choice in the launches and causes us to sink down to the level that the agressing country sits at.\n\n3: Returning fire almost certainly bears the promise of environmental collapse and in doing so dooms everyone on the planet as well as billions of species of plants and animals. If we don't launch and instead let ourselves be hit we still have the possibility of saving the world entire.\n\nIf i remember any of my other points I will edit them into the main post. \n\nFirst Reply:\nTo your first point. Even though we may be destroyed, by not launching we are allowing the aggressor to survive. What's to stop them from launching an attack on another country? They have shown to be willing to destroy the entire population of a country, would have plenty of conventional weapons, and would presumably have the ability to make more nukes. \nSecond Reply:\nYou're right in a few ways, but ultimately - wrong.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, let's just assume we're talking about the US and Russia. First, there are millions of innocent people that would be killed in a retaliatory strike. There are, however, millions of innocents being killed in the initial Russian strike, and don't they deserve justice? Second, both the US and Russia have defenses designed to intercept and destroy incoming missiles. It's totally theoretical when it comes to the question of how many nukes would make it through anyway, but there's always the possibility that we could stop some, and a portion of the US population would be protected. Wouldn't you want to be fighting back (launching retaliatory strikes) in order to keep them alive?\n\nThird, and probably most importantly, is your 3rd point. This reason is *exactly* why we would launch a retaliatory strike. The Russians know that even if they wipe out the entire US population, they won't have a world to enjoy, because between their strike and our retaliation, the world would be ruined. Even if the US didn't retaliate, Earth would be pretty messed up. That much radiation would cripple the environment worldwide, as the radiation slowly spreads to the rest of the world. Because both Russia and the US know that any attack will result in no winner, there's no reason for either to attack. This is called MAD (which I'm sure you know, but for the sake of those who don't - Mutually Assured Destruction). If for one second Russia believed that we wouldn't retaliate, then they wouldn't hesitate to kill us. The reason we're all still alive is *because* we're willing to kill everyone in Russia.\n\nFourth, keep in mind that if Russia wanted to stop us from retaliating, they'd have to hit us *everywhere*, not just the continental US. They'd have to hit every base we have in Europe and across the world, because if they didn't, we'd just send planes carrying nukes from those bases to wipe them out.\n\nEdit: Fifth, if we didn't react, we'd certainly be the \"bigger man,\" but we'd also be dead. Morals are great, but useless when you're dead. You may die with honor, but you're still dead. And when you're dead, who cares how moral you are? It's not like anyone's going to be around to praise how you would rather die than compromise your honor."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Bringing hip-hop so far into the mainstream it has basically become pop music. Brought his icon of a persona to the silver screen with an award winning soundtrack in tow. All of this happened within the first decade of his career. I think it's safe to say he's had an enormous impact on music as a whole throughout the world. \n\nIconic within genre and abroad? Check\n\nChanged genres? Marketing? Style? Triple check.\n\nWe will look back on today's current music and remember Eminem for everything he's done. Beyond that, I think the oversaturation of the music industry that has been caused by the dawn of the internet age is the main cause of the many one hit wonders, short attention span, single-serve artists that we hear nowadays. That, along with the fact that most of the broad, accessible genres have \"all been done before\", so the innovation comes in smaller amounts and in subgenres that aren't going to have the major cultural impact that the artists of yesteryear had. I think it's a \"pre-internet vs post-internet\" battle that you are referencing in your search for finding those impactful artists. They exist, but it's impossible to stand out as much as the artists you've mentioned were able to due to their place in time and the technology that exists now.\n\nWhile I think he is the obvious answer to your question I'll throw out some other names that might work for ya...\n\nTaylor Swift (made country popular)\n\nKid Rock (turned country, rock, and hip-hop into pop)\n\nBlink-182/Green Day (started in the 90's, blew up in the 00's, making pop-punk popular)\n\nSystem of a Down/Slipknot (made heavy metal popular)\n\nLinkin Park (meshed rock and hip-hop and made it popular)\n\nThe White Stripes/The Strokes/Interpol (turned indie rock into an incredibly marketable genre)\n\nSkrillex and Deadmau5 (will be remembered as some of the first to bring house, techno, and dubstep into the mainstream)\n\nBright Eyes/Death Cab/Modest Mouse (more underground success, but took some good old roots americana, added some emo, incredible song-writing and developed a cult following)\n\nSecond Reply:\nThe White Stripes/Jack White had almost single-handedly brought blues music back to young people in the early 00s. Not to mention he was basically the first and only one to successfully combine punk and blues on a massive scale with songs like seven nation army and icky thump.\n\nThe Black Keys would have never become popular if not for the white stripes, who reminded people a 2 person band can work on a radio format. They then took the blues formula and brought back 70s soul, R&amp;B and delta blues influence into the \"rock single\" of modern day.\n\nThe strokes did something very similar with garage rock in NYC in the early 00s. They came on the scene when alternative, pop-punk and arena rock dominated the rock charts and turned it on its head. \"Is this it\" changed the direction of rock music and showed that you didn't need to be U2 or Blink 182 to sell records.\n\nAnd that's just blues and garage rock. Not to mention what the Foo Fighters did with modern rock, what QOTSA did with stoner rock, or John Mayer did with texas blues-rock with the john mayer trio.

I have been arrested more than once.  But I'll tell you one thing, I have never failed to comply with an officers orders.\n\nI nearly ever incident of a person involved in a police shooting, they have one problem.  They are not being compliant.  The United States offers you rights, but your rights can't keep you alive.  This often turns into a matter of \"you're victim blaming.\"  I'm simply saying that right or wrong, the behavior of these victims can most often be described as \"exercising outrageously poor judgement.\" \n\nFor one simple reason, I value my life.

But that's not what they're saying. They're saying the reaction to what the victims did wrong was radically disproportionate, and that if the same scenario occurred with a white person it would have ended differently. \n\nLet's think of this in terms of three tiers: 1) punishment for the original crime; 2) punishment for resisting arrest or otherwise compounding the original crime; 3) straight up killing the person. Nobody is arguing (well, *most* people are not arguing) against #s 1 or 2. They are arguing against #3 exclusively. There's an acknowledgment that these men did something wrong, and then something wronger, but that neither of those justifies getting shot. For example, Garner earned #1 for selling loose cigarettes, and #2 for swatting away the officer trying to handcuff him (even this is debatable, but I'll let it go for the sake of the bigger issue). But #3 shouldn't have even been on the table. The maneuver used on him wasn't authorized; he didn't need five different officers swarming him. That's the part people are mad about. No one thinks he should have just gotten off entirely. \n\nIs it a practical reality that they might have avoided death by being entirely submissive? Probably, sure. But most people aren't arguing against that either. Instead, they're arguing that 1) Changes need to be made to alter that practical reality and 2) An altogether *different* practical reality exists for white people. You say that it's not a matter of principle, but the debate you're watching *is* one primarily concerned with principle, as a means to effect a change in practical necessities down the road. Don't think for a second that the black community is somehow unaware of the best practices in dealing with the police, or surprised at what these actions bring on. What we're seeing is just cases where people get particularly scared, or frustrated, or whatever. And sure, their reactions are mistakes, both legally and practically. But they're very, very minor mistakes compared to people who earn their death, like a hostage taker or a mass shooter. \n\nTL;DR \u2014 Having sympathy is distinct from expecting exoneration. You can both acknowledge their wrongdoing and be angry at how their wrongdoing was handled, which is what most people are doing. This controversy is mainly dealing in principle, whether or not principle is important to you.

I don't believe in heroes, and so I'm prepared to change my view on this.  THe trouble is, every last bit of news I hear about the current Middle East conflicts goes only to reinforce my ever-growing belief that the Kurds are the only group involved with any moral high ground.\n\n1) The Kurds espouse a number of western values that are largely absent in the region.\n\nOnly The Kurds and the (middle and lower class) Iranians show any tendency to respect women's rights or treat them as equals deserving of respect or status.  The Kurds have women in their military, and even their conservative tribal organizations can have Matriarchs in charge of political and military decisions.\n\n2) They care about more than just themselves.\n\nThe Kurds have gone out of their way, at significant danger to themselves, to rescue other ethnic minorities in the region, including famously the Yazidis, who everyone else was more than happy to let ISIS literally murder, enslave, and rape at genocidal scales.\n\n3) Their political opponents have all shown themselves to be monsters in the fullness of time.\n\nTurkey is key here.  For a while Turkey managed to keep up quite a reputation as a modern secular-Islamic state.  Now they're wringing their hands about how *powerless* they are to stop ISIS while they gleefully watch the black banner do all their dirty work for them, then step in with overwhelming force to rescue Ataturk's grave the moment it's threatened.  They're bombing Kurdish targets *right now* while crying about ISIS.  I would want independence from them too.\n\n**Things that will not convince me:**\n\n1) A Kurd did something bad once.\n\nEvery group consists of a bulk center and extremes on either end.  It takes a pattern of ideological violence to establish that a group is responsible collectively.  I need to be shown that the Kurds, as a national or cultural entity, are at least half as bad as their neighbors in terms of the actions they will routinely, officially, or systemically commit or tolerate.\n\n2) It is advantageous to ally ourselves with monsters.\n\nLook, you can be totally right about this.  I won't even argue that this isn't possible, and might even agree with you, but it does not change my view about what we, the west, *should* be doing.\n\n\nMake me a cynic again, please.\n\n\nFirst Reply:\n\"The Kurds\" are an ethnic group, with a similar mix of people as any other. There are many Kurds in ISIS. When you're describing \"The Kurds,\" you're conflating many different groups with different agendas and ideologies, to the point that they have openly fought each other in the past. For example, you cite women's rights, when Kurdish areas have some of the highest rates of Female Genital Mutilation of anywhere in the world. The YPG in Syria are a socialist/communist movement with a high regard for women's rights, but they are drastically different from the Iraqi Kurds. The same PKK fighters that might save the Yizidis one month are placing fake emergency calls and shooting/kidnapping the police and nurses who respond the next.\n\nI am extremely sympathetic to the cause of the YPG in particular, but I feel like your view is unduly influenced by the way the western media has simplified and thereby misrepresented the situation in the middle east. \nSecond Reply:\n&gt;1) The Kurds espouse a number of western values that are largely absent in the region.\n\nFirst of all, there are a number of other actors which does subscribe to woman's rights. Turkey for example has opposition leftist parties which supports women's rights. Israel is also another example of a western valued country in the region.\n\n&gt;2) They care about more than just themselves.\n\n\nI feel that this part is based on an incredibly....optimistic view of the Kurds.\n\nKurdish middlemen, including Kurdish political leaders are quite willing to work with ISIS when there's material gains involved. See their involvement with helping ISIS to sell oil for instance:\n\nhttp://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6c269c4e-5ace-11e4-b449-00144feab7de.html#axzz3hJfQSOhy\n\nEvery single political group in the Middle-East are largely motivated by material gains. Even incredibly ideological groups have bottom lines. The Kurds are fighting ISIS because they are a threat to Kurdistan, if ISIS wasn't a threat to the Kurds, the Kurds wouldn't fight them even if they are committing genocide.\n\n&gt;3) Their political opponents have all shown themselves to be monsters in the fullness of time.\n\nTurkey isn't even too different from the US in the 1980s in this regard, who cooperated with Islamic extremists to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. \n\nPeople are primarily motivated by realistic geopolitics in the region. It's awfully problematic to attribute actions to \"morals\" or ideology when there are so many strange bedfellows if you look at ideology. \n\nSyria for instance is allied with Iran despite Syria being a nominally secular, atheistic state and Iran is a theocracy. \n\nSaudi Arabia, the most Islamist country in the region and Egypt are also close despite the fact that the current dictator (let's just admit it) of Egypt came to power on the promise that he will save the country from the Islamists. \n\nIsrael, a western, Jewish state and Saudi Arabia, a country which don't allow Jews into the country, have a defacto alliance against Iran. And Israel sees the Saudis as a stabilizer in the Gulf.\n\nOverall, I think you underestimate how self-interested people are, if the day comes when the Kurds needs to cooperate with ISIS (say against the Iraqi central government), they will do it to guarantee their own survival."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

[Ken White at Popehat describes how:](http://popehat.com/2011/12/01/reminder-oh-wont-you-please-shut-up/)\n\n\n\nI think there should be no crime here unless it can be proven that the falsehood actually impeded an investigation in a meaningful manner.  Also, I think the penalty should be much less severe, more like a misdemeanor. \n\nFirst Reply:\nIANAL but I think this is already included in the law. The law makes a misrepresentation of a **material** fact illegal. This means that the prosecutor has to demonstrate that the statement was false and that the false statement mattered to the investigation in a meaningful way. \n\nSo I don't think lying to the FBI is a crime in the case where the lie does not matter. \nSecond Reply:\nSo, I looked into this on Lexis with a quick search because your question is an interesting one!  What I found is a large body of case law annotating \u00a7 1001 and reversing convictions for lack of materiality.  Upon a reading of these cases I do not believe that your example here: \n\n&gt; They ask questions which they know the answers to, can prove are lies, **and which the only purpose of asking is to get a 1001 charge.**\n\nparticularly because of the bolded portion, would support a conviction.  In other words, I believe the materiality requirement is taken quite seriously by the courts and acts as a safeguard which in most cases would prevent the abuse you are concerned about.  \n\nThere are an awful lot of cases dealing with this issue, published and unpublished, but here are a few quotes I thought most relevant and concise:\n\n&gt; [T]he purpose of the materiality requirement of section 1001 is to exclude trivial falsehoods from the purview of the statute, since false statements that lack the capacity to influence a determination required to be made [by the agency] are too trivial to violate the statute.\n\n*United States v. Wheeler*, 247 Fed. Appx. 558, 560 (5th Cir. 2007)\n\n&gt; From the statutory history, it is evident that section 1001 was not intended to reach all false statements made to governmental agencies and departments, but only those false statements that might support fraudulent claims against the Government, or that might pervert or corrupt the authorized functions of those agencies to whom the statements were made. Typical of the kind of statements that are within the purview of section 1001 are false reports of crime made to federal law enforcement agencies that may engender groundless federal investigations.  The statute was not intended to embrace oral, unsworn statements, unrelated to any claim of the declarant to a privilege from the United States or to a claim against the United States, given in response to inquiries initiated by a federal agency or department, except, perhaps, where such a statement will substantially impair the basic functions entrusted by law to that agency.\n\n*United States v. Bedore*, 455 F.2d 1109, 1111 (9th Cir. 1972)\n\n&gt; Deciding whether a statement is \"material\" requires the determination of at least two subsidiary questions of purely historical fact: (a) \"what statement was made?\" and (b) \"what decision was the agency trying to make?\"\n\n*United States v. Gaudin*, 515 U.S. 506, 512 (U.S. 1995)\n\nSo if the FBI is asking you a question \"which the only purpose of asking is to get a 1001 charge,\" then a false response could not be material.  The state would need to prove that they were required to make some determination (in the case of the FBI, the resolution of a criminal investigation), that they asked you something in furtherance of the investigation, and that you knowingly gave a false response calculated to deceive them in a manner that would influence the outcome of the investigation.\n\nLots of legalese in there but I'm happy to discuss or post more!"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Now, I can't say that for some of my friends or the people who have gone through that with family or people in general.\n\n\nAs I was walking with my date (M) through town, a group of college students started laughing at us for holding hands. As we were walking by, I kept thinking of all the ways I could get them to stop because if they were to laugh at us, who else are they gonna make feel humiliated or disgusting. I felt like a pet. Some play toy. And that my life was humorous to other people.\n\n\nI can't say that there would be anything to say or do to make them realize that it's normal to appeal to the same sex. I'm ALL FOR education. I believe education makes the world go around and it's so perfect to learn abd understand new things about the world AND be open minded to everything. \n\n\nHowever, when I see a group of people act ignorantly, I can't help but clench my fist and think about raising hell in their life. The people they are are the kind that take pleasure in hurting people. Why? Because they want to do it for themselves. They can only think about themselves and that they're more perfect than everyone else.\n\n\nI sure as hell am not perfect. I resort to violence when it comes down to this topic. But when I hear or see ignorance made to hurt others, like this (https://youtu.be/1df_i26wh-w). I can't help but feel like this ignorance needs to be dealt with a punch in the face. Nobody deserves what I got. And nobody deserves the ignorance others recieve.\n\n\nIgnorance stems from close mindedness, which is something in this world we don't need. If we were all close minded, we wouldn't have advanced as far as we have. Do we really need more of it in this world? Is it necessary for our survival? I believe so to the extent that when there is an absolutely close minded person,there is an equally absolutely open minded person (the bell curve).\n\n\nSo to deal with these people is to punish them with hurt nowhere near the pain they've inflicted onto people, while still sending a message. CMV\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nSo from what I gather from your story, you wanted these people to be physically punished because they....hurt your feelings? I understand fighting (in a literal sense) for rights and equality under the law, but you aren't entitled to live in a world where people don't judge you. \n\nWhat you consider \"ignorance\" might be completely different from what someone else considers ignorant. A vegan might see meat eaters as being ignorant for causing pain and suffering to animals. But a meat eater may see a vegan as being closed-minded by judging people for the manner in which they obtain a basic human necessity. You can't label a certain opinion (and a group that holds that opinion) as \"ignorant\" and deserving of violence because you simply don't hold the authority to decide which opinions qualify as ignorant. And what about the people who are quietly ignorant? They may not openly laugh at you on the street but they still think of you as scum and spread their agenda. Do they deserve violence too? Even though they've done nothing but have an opinion?\n\nAgain, you do not have the right to live in a world where people don't judge you. But people do have the right to an opinion, and they should not be subject to violent repercussions just because they hold that opinion.\n\nLastly, how do you fix ignorance? That's like asking how do I fix people's opinions who don't agree with mine? You don't. Let them have their shitty opinions, and choose not to give them the time of day.\nSecond Reply:\nLets start with ignorance, because I believe you're not representing it properly, and aren't fully thinking through the implications of what your suggesting.\n\nIgnorance does not stem from closed mindedness, but rather, lack of knowledge. You, and every other human on earth are ignorant about many things in the world. Being ignorant has no effect on your openness to new ideas, in fact, people who are ignorant could be considered a blank slate. Perhaps a better word for this would be inconsiderate or insensitive?\n\n\nBeing closed minded is essentially being resistant to change, and that's not always a bad thing. Skepticism is a healthy thing, and in certain circumstances, it makes sense to adjust your willingness to be persuaded. It is in some ways necessary to our survival, and has been a factor in allowing us to survive this long.\n\n\nAs for punishing ignorance, that's not a proportional response. People's brains are not capable of comprehending everything that's happening in the world, and ignorance is necessary. The weight of all of the suffering, sadness, and tragedy in the world is not something people are equipped to actually all comprehend at once.\n\n\npeoples instincts and emotions do strongly influence them. You're desire to use violence is a perfect example of that. I agree that in our current society, mistreatment of homosexuals is a serious issue, and we should be educating the ignorant, and attempting to persuade the insensitive, but that doesn't mean we should expect ignorance to away completely."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

By using them in a casual way (not as an insult, but in a way similar to how people used to say \"that's so gay\") we send the message that it really isn't a big deal, which allows the word to slowly fade away from its original meaning to the point that it doesn't really have anything to do with what it once did.\n\n\nThe main thing that I draw from for this view is the word cunt. This is a pretty common insult where I used to live, though not as much in the U.S.; it basically just means jerk, and calling someone a cunt has little to do with female genitalia. If we manage to do this with words like nigger than it doesn't have to be associated with the thing it was originally connected with; in other words, it's just a generic insult that doesn't necessarily have to be associated with that group, like the word \"jerk\". \n\n\nThis isn't a view that I strongly hold, and I am fairly open to it being changed and look forward to hearing what all of you have to say in this matter. Thank you in advance to everyone who posts.\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nJust out of curiosity, do you happen to be a lesbian, other flavor of LBGT, or black?\n\nIt amuses me when I hear lots straight people *insisting* that their use of the word faggot or gay couldn't possibly be offensive because it wasn't directed at me and wasn't intended to put me down. It never seems to occur to them that their frame of reference simply can't predict what will and won't be hurtful, or that the solution \"let's just use it a lot so that you become numb to the original meaning\" isn't a good solution.\n\nI suppose that comes off as condescending. I really shouldn't do that, but this sort of thinking frustrates me. I'm a believer in descriptivist linguistics, so I understand the argument, but this is a different ball game. I could go on about normalization, discrimination and so forth, but I'd rather just talk about outcomes.\n\nIf you had asked me in the mid 2000's, when faggot and gay were really in prime use, I would have told you that it didn't really bother me. I had in fact become numb to their use. Now in 2015, it's slightly rarer to even see people saying \"that's so gay\", I can honestly say this state of language is 100% preferable to earlier. I feel better about myself, and interacting online. Becoming numb to faggot and gay wasn't a *solution*, it was a *coping mechanism*.\n\nDespite what you think, when you use those terms, *you make people feel unwanted,* not to go all Tumblr on you, but when you can reduce your negative impact on the world by such a simple act as not using obviously offensive words like Faggot or Nigger you should feel an obligation to do so.\n\nBy all means, in your close group of friends where there's no faggots or niggers to casually make feel unwanted, go nuts. Use whatever terms you like. But anywhere else, maybe be a decent person and restrain yourself a little.\nSecond Reply:\nLet me talk about a big distinction, saying vs using. \n\nSaying a word is just uttering it. Using a word is, in the case of slurs, throwing it at people. \n\nSaying slurs for the purpose of discussing their oppressive backgrounds, their history, as part of a story or whatever else is absolutely fine, because its use in that context is not a form of oppression.\n\nUsing slurs, as in saying this words to imply negative connotation or to harass people is unacceptable. Slurs are verbal weapons, and while continued use may lessen the impact, it normalizes the idea that the target of this slur bears x qualities (usually negative \"I look like a dyke today\" \"I smell like a nigger\") This hurts the targets of these slurs, even if they're not there to hear it, by perpetuating harmful stereotypes.\n\nAlso as a gay guy who was bullied, having someone like a friend use \"faggot\" to describe someone or \"faggoty\" to describe something (again, generally to put it down) really upsets me, just how people can't bear to see knives or scissors after being attacked with one, It's hard for me to hear the word after being attacked with one, so I politely tell my friends to please tone down the slurs.\n\nThe difference here is that \"cunt\" per se targets no real demographic at this point, mainly because cunt was not a word for a person but a word for genitalia, while the other slurs you mention do target people in current memory."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I don't watch every game but when it comes to sports, I know more and watch more than any of my peers through work, school, or friendship. I like hockey, baseball, and the NFL. But regular season games are boring.\n\nBoring can be good sometimes. A casual baseball game on a lazy afternoon is amazing, and it's great in the background during a family gathering. Seeing a game in person is awesome and regular season games are perfect for that because if you miss a play it's not the end of the world. I find the NFL regular season *almost* engaging because of the short schedule. I understand that in the NHL and MLB you need to play more games so the gap between 1st and last is sufficiently large, so I'm not suggesting shorter schedules. I would just really like someone to make regular season games more exciting for me.\n\nThe NHL is my favorite by far, but I can't stand regular season games. Until the very end of the season it just feels like watching practice. There's no excitement. It's like a 10 cent bet. Until the end of the season, very little is on the line. I don't see the appeal.\n\nSo can someone explain it to me? When I ask my friends who do watch the regular season they get condescending.\nFirst Reply:\nYou should watch soccer. The games are divided into multiple competitions for different trophies rather than a regular and post season. Its much better as every game in a 38 game Premier League season counts, from beginning to end. This also results in the overall best team winning the league rather than a team only playing well for a certain time of year prevailing. \n\nAnd if your into the do-or-die style like in playoffs, there are several cup tournaments thst incorporate the same feelings as playoffs. \nSecond Reply:\nThe NFL schedule is good because it's so short.  With only 16 games on predictable days, each game has an urgency to it.  It's not quite playoff level, sure, but the difference of 1-2 games can mean an invitation to the playoffs or not... so the teams do bring their best every single game.  There's a lot of parity in the league, so you don't see too many atrocious teams or bad games. \n\nThe MLB schedule is good because it's so long.  The times are predictable and games are cheap &amp; accessible (outside Boston &amp; NY, anyways).  They're not *exciting*, particularly on TV IMO... but they're fun in person, and nice to have on in the background on a lazy summer day.  There are some crummy teams/games, but MLB is a little more about the experience (drinking outside in a fun atmosphere) than the game itself IMO.\n\nThere's no problem with either of those - they're great fun.\n\nI'd have to agree that the NBA &amp; NHL regular seasons kind of suck.  The sport is physical enough and the seasons long enough that there's injury / fatigue risk, so teams play kind of conservatively and rest star players aggressively.  But with 40 home games (instead of the 80-something of mlb), tickets are still rather pricey for many teams.  The game days/times aren't predictable, so I find myself missing them.  A crumby NBA team gets *killed* on the court, it's not supremely fun to watch.\n\nI find myself watching the NBA Christmas day games, going in person a couple times and following my local team (often day after write ups), and then watching better matchups &amp; post season.  I'd love to see the NBA season cut down to 50-60 games and played on consistent days of week.  Can Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday be basketball days please?"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

All laws of nature follow the universal law of causation, which states that everything in the universe has a cause and is thus an effect of that cause. \n\nIf premise #1 is true then everything in the physical world must be determined. \n\nIf everything is determined than there is no such thing as free will.\nIf every behaviour is determined by laws of causation it is physically impossible for someone to be free, as that freedom would require the nullification of the laws of causation. In other words to believe in free will is also to believe in spontaneous magic, it's to believe that humans possess powers that could only be explained by the supernatural.\n\nFor example: In most legal traditions it is customary to judge whether someone is guilty of x crime by accumulating evidence in order to prove that  x person intentionally did this crime. Let's assume that there was enough evidence to prove without doubt that Greg Smith robbed a convenience store. Now that we have proof that it was Greg, we should ask ourselves if Greg really chose to rob the store. As soon as you ask yourself that kind of question the only scientific recourse you have is to understand Greg as a causal agent. What caused Greg to rob the store? Was it the fact that Greg is from a low socio-economic class? Was it the fact that Greg lost his job 2 weeks ago and Greg wont be able to feed his kids if he doesn't find a way to get more money? Is it the fact that Greg was abused as child? Did Greg rob the store due to complex laws of causality that are reducible to both biological and environmental reasons? Or did Greg simply rob the store because he felt like it?\n\nEven more simple decisions like choosing between a chocolate bar and an apple can be reducible to complex causal interplay between biological and environmental laws. Did you choose the chocolate bar because you like it better? Or is it because we have an evolutionary pull towards sugar and fat dense food? Is it because you read an article on naturalnews.com talking about how dark chocolate can cure your pancreas cancer? Or did you chose the apple because you grew up on an orchard farm and apples remind you of your innocent childhood? or did you choose the apple because you already had psychologically determined bias for foods that will fit in your limited calorie budget for the week?\n\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that as soon as you try to define freedom of choice scientifically it inevitably reduce down to causal mechanisms. Whether those casual mechanisms are internal/biological or external/environmental or a mix of both they are the only things that influence us and completely shape our behaviour. Anything else that can be said to have a role in our behaviours (like our \"independent volition\", our \"moral compass\" and all other notions pertaining to freedom of will) is inherently unscientific and can only be explained through a belief in the supernatural. CMV   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Reply:\n&gt;Let's start off with premise #1\nEverything that is observable in the universe follows laws of nature. All laws of nature follow the universal law of causation, which states that everything in the universe has a cause and is thus an effect of that cause.\nIf premise #1 is true then everything in the physical world must be determined.\n\nHere is the first issue. The laws of nature we we can best observe them now include the fact that there are stochastic processes, random events. This strongly implies that reality is not deterministic. It is not that things are determined and we just cant measure them, things like the Double Slit Experiment reveal to us that we cannot have both local realism and hidden variables (controlling the result of the seemingly random event).\nSecond Reply:\n&gt;Let's start off with premise #1\n\nEverything that is observable in the universe follows laws of nature. All laws of nature follow the universal law of causation, which states that everything in the universe has a cause and is thus an effect of that cause. \n\nThis is backwards. The laws of nature are formulated to explain what we observe. If we observe something that doesn't fit said laws, we find out why or amend the laws to suit our observations.\n\nI leave the rest for you to philosophize over."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The expansion has encouraged players to make decks that kill quickly before the game can even begin to get interesting; this avoids the entirety of what makes Hearthstone special.\n\nAnother thing is that Legendaries are totally whack as a core concept. They come off as useful tools to take out foes but are secretly a ploy to get \"consumers\" to buy packs to try and earn them (in a free-to-play game). The rarity of these cards even further prove that it benefits those who purchase packs in bulk and get them quicker, letting them get \"better\" faster and leave other players in the dust.\n\nBlizzard has also recently lowered the chance of getting decent dailies, meaning you have a lower chance of generating in game currency, further benefiting the payers.\n\nCards involving random chance while also altering the mana curve (Voidcaller, Unstoppable Portal, Alarm-o-Bot) are devastating and should not exist. This is different than Druid's mana increasing cards as this is a calculated strategy that is understood by the opponent.\n\nFirst Reply:\ncan you give me an example of any card game that treated those who purchased no-cards vs. those who purchased a lot of cards equally?\n\nI have never recieved a new pack of YGO-cards because I won against an opponent 10 times, I had to go to the store, buy a new pack and hope for the best.\n\nIf I didn't expand my library than that meant I was stuck with all the strategies I currently had.\n\nOf course payers will have an edge and there is nothing wrong with that. That is the nature of CCG/TCG's.\n\nIf you want some solace though, it all comes back to the time vs. value conversation.\n\nIf your time is more worth to you than your money, you are more likely to spend some bucks for progress than the other way around.\n\nand if you want another solace, the game is already free to play and of superb-quality, if you dish out 50$, it's as if you bought a new game at retail price for which you can get a decent value out of, if you calculate $-spent/h-played.\nSecond Reply:\nMeta's get established in any game, but in card games its very easy to see optimum strategies. As a result, in constructed you see really focused decks that are always going to be annoying. Zoolock, current mech cards, there will likely never be a utopia of strategy in a single block of hearthstone, just like in MTG.\n\n\nA meta will always get figured out, and grow stale. The solution is an expansion. It shakes up the meta and throws a bunch of new strategies at players. Playing around a new expansion drop is probably the most fun time to play the game.\n\n\nThe game does benefit paying players in constructed a lot, but it's still a much more customer friendly than any traditional card game (Again, like MTG). I think it's awesome that it's entirely possible to play the game without monetary investment.\n\n\nThankfully, there is a solution built into the game for both of these problems: The arena!"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I have driven near and far and have never had to take a toll road.  I recently ventured into Pennsylvania for an internship and was absolutely flabbergasted by the toll roads.  I have always heard from people that they are good because they have higher speed limits.  A lot of the free highways i have been on have 70 mph speed limits and when I went into Pennsylvania, I paid $5.00 to go 40mph on a \"highway\" for a whopping 2 miles.  I also have gone through some other toll roads since my time here but that was the most obnoxious one.  Anyways I just think they are pointless because in no way did it make my travel more convenient.  Maybe I just don't know enough about them but please change my view!\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nToll roads are often created and maintained by private companies. Regardless of how fast you may go, companies need to pay taxes for using the land on which they have built the road. The public roads you travelled on are payed by your taxdollars, but private companies must also pay taxes to maintain their private roads. The money has to come from somewhere.\n\nAside from this, toll roads also create detours from the regular chokepoints in public highways. People use the roads because it provides a shorter path to their destination. Additionally, people use toll roads because they want a consistent path to their goal. If, say, people wanted to get to work on time, they would rather use a toll road that provides a consistent 20 minute lag than use the public road, which may vary from a clear road to a full hour of lag.\nSecond Reply:\nToll roads are fantastic.  What they give us the ability to do is put the cost of a road on just the people who use it, rather than *everyone* regardless of whether they use the road or not.  They give you the choice.  You don't have to take the toll road.  You're welcome to take the free route and go more slowly."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The device already has 23,058 reviews from testers and it is just hitting the market. Now imagine one of these in everyone's home. I will cover some of the highlights of the launch video as examples in my argument.\n\n---\n\n**Reason 1: Laziness**\n\nA lot of technology today encourages laziness. However, this takes it to a whole new level.\n\nExample: \"Alexa, add waffles to my shopping list.\" Now we don't even need to jot things down or even type them into our smart phones at the very least.\n\nExample: 'Alexa can provide news!' Instead of reading the newspaper or watching the news we can listen to a mono-tone robot recite world events.\n\nExample: \"Alexa, what is the chance of rain?\" The woman is literally standing next to the door when she asks this question. However, she would rather receive the weather from her nifty new gadget than to actually look outside or watch a weather report.\n\n---\n\n**Reason 2: Reliance on Technology**\n\nMost of us can admit that we are uncomfortably dependent on our smart phones. However, what if our smart phone was never in our pocket? What if it was always plugged in and tempting us? This is essentially Amazon Echo. The narrator even proclaims that Echo will, \"Become a part of the family!\"\n\nExample: \"The echo is a tool that we use to keep our household functioning.\" This is a quote from a mother as she dresses her daughter. I am aware that these are commercially invented situations being reenacted by paid actors. However, I feel as though they are fairly accurate depictions of how people will use this technology and how they will respond to it. Clearly, there are many issues with one piece of technology keeping a household together.\n\nExample: \"The prime re-ordering is when you can ask Alexa to order something you've already ordered through your prime account.\" Now we can shop by shouting a phrase at a robot! No need to go out.\n\nI think laziness coupled with reliance on technology have been the most harmful qualities that todays youth (myself included) suffer from. We find it difficult to go out and make plans. We find it difficult to socialize. We find it difficult to talk on the phone. In a world full of constant updates and fast information, why should we access things in any other way? We want things instantaneously and at our discretion.\n\n---\n\n**Reason 3: Invasion of Privacy**\n\nMajor corporations will do anything to learn more about consumers and what they want. Echo allows consumers to order things through Amazon Prime. I am not afraid of what this AI will do granted that it can always hear and learn. As long as it's just a black cylinder speaker (with no hidden flame-thrower) I don't believe we have a reason to fear an Echo uprise. Rather, I am more afraid of what the men and women behind the scenes will do. \n\nExample: 'Echo can hear you from anywhere in the room, so it's always ready to help!' \"I can have the water running, I can be cooking, the TV can be on in the back room, and she still can hear me.\" \n\nAll I could think while watching this was, \"Genisys is Skynet!\"\n\n---\n\nHere is a link to the [Amazon page.](http://www.amazon.com/Amazon-SK705DI-Echo/dp/B00X4WHP5E)\n\nSo, can anyone give me some reason as to why Amazon Echo can be more helpful than harmful?\n\n\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nI'm going to break down each point separately.\n\n1) Amazon Echo creates laziness - So your examples are someone dictating instead of writing, listening to news instead of reading, and asking about weather instead of just looking outside. \n\nDictating has been around for quite almost ever. Just because the person isn't writing it down doesn't make them lazy. If we are making assumptions, you can assume that maybe they are becoming more organized and efficient with their time.\n\nAs for listening to the news, you could say it's exactly like watching the news on TV or on the Internet. Or it's like listening to the radio. Listening instead of reading is not laziness. It may even make news slightly more accessible which would inform more people (the argument of informing them correctly or incorrectly is a different subject for a different day).\n\nAs for weather, I love the weather and just by looking outside I could not tell you what the weather will be like. I still need technology to give me a close educated guess based on stats and history to tell me how hot it's going to be or if there will be a late afternoon shower or if it's going to snow so much that I should probably stay home.\n\nThis idea that accessing information by voice is not laziness. It is just another method of educating ourselves in whatever we want to know.\n\n2) Amazon Echo creates a reliance on technology - I think you slightly used the \"The echo is a tool that we use to keep our household functioning.\" out of context. First of all, they use it as a tool, much like a cell phone helps keep the household functioning, much like refrigerators help, much like a car helps. These tools do certain things that help make our lives easier so we can spend more time doing whatever we want, or as the ad depicts, spend more time with the family. Secondly, the Echo is not depicted doing anything that current technologies can't already do.\n\nAs for shopping, what is the harm in ordering toilet paper by asking your Echo to do so? While yes, some people may go out less because of this, they probably already weren't going out because you can order everything online, without the Echo. And, as the ad shows, this feature (along with others) can be extremely helpful for those with disabilities.\n\n3) Amazon Echo is an Invasion of Privacy - This is a running theme with the Internet of Things. Any piece of technology that can connect to the internet can be used to collect your information and sell it to whoever wants it. The Echo is not the only thing that does this.\n\nNow for it always listening. Sure, slightly terrifying, but it would take a lot of work Amazon to parse through audio from 24/7/365 just to find out what you like and don't like. They will probably keep track of your commands, but they (and most websites, companies, apps, etc.) already do. And for the most part, the big companies use this information to make your experiences with them better. Yes, nefarious things may happen, but companies take big risks by doing so. Just look at [Lenovo and the Superfish fiasco](http://www.cnet.com/news/lenovo-hit-by-lawsuit-over-superfish-adware/#!) and [Samsung with their always listening TVs](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/02/09/385001258/samsungs-privacy-policy-warns-customers-their-smart-tvs-are-listening).\n\nIn summary, this device is not harmful because it makes information more accesible (which does not create laziness), it does things that current technology already does, and it is no more of a spy on your life, than your phone or computer already is. In fact, as the video shows, it can make life easier for those with disabilities.\nSecond Reply:\nyou are inconsistently and ambiguously defining your concerns, and false attributing consequences to technology without offering any data to support your claims.\n\nReason 1: Laziness\n\nwhy is jotting a note down on paper less lazy than adding it to a cloud-based shopping list through a voice interface? have you actually used the two side by side? using paper is frequently the fastest method there. using echo, not only do you have to wait for the device to confirm whether it actually performed the action, you have to take out a phone, unlock it, launch an app, and wait for a load before you can even use your shopping list. paper is instantaneous, and you could argue that it's the laziest option. 'it feels lazier' is not a valid conclusion supported by data.\n\nReason 2: Reliance on Technology\n\nyou are already completely, utterly, and irreversibly reliant on technology. others have made this point but i want to stress the absolute and total reality of it to you. every single item around you is human technology. building a fire is technology. you will die very quickly if you stopped using technology. you failed to demonstrate why reliance on technology is bad in general, and why reliance on echo is bad specifically. \n\nyou say\n&gt;'clearly there are many issues with one piece of technology keeping a household together' \n\nbut you do not elaborate on what these issues are, or provide evidence that these issues actually exist. you could argue that a family car, a refrigerator, or even the house itself keeps a household together. these are all technology. by your argument, these would all be problematic for some mysterious and unstated reason. \n\nyour other example: \n&gt;'shop by shouting a phrase at a robot, no need to go out' \n\nthis is equally presumptuous and ill-defined. firstly, you haven't actually stated why 'not going out' is a bad thing. maybe it lets me have more time to relax at home instead of standing in line at the market, which is definitely a positive outcome for me. secondly, you assume that not shopping equals not going out, which is plainly not true. maybe with the time that i save by not going to the store, i go out and do something else instead, like see a movie, hang out with friends, or go hiking. here, your argument is based on unfounded assumptions and cannot support your claim. \n\nwhen you say 'reliance on technology' what you seem to really mean is that 'we are too reliant on some particular technologies like smartphones and the internet, but it's ok to be reliant on other technologies like electricity and modern food production.' you have picked some arbitrary limit on technological advancement, for example 2006 (just before smartphones) or 1985 (just before popular consumer internet) and have decided that that's the right amount of technology to be reliant on. however, you still haven't provided any convincing arguments as to why that particular level of technology is the right one. \n\n&gt; In a world full of constant updates and fast information, why should we access things in any other way?\n\nindeed, why? you're claiming that making things slower and more difficult would be better. it's your job to answer this question. \n\nReason 3: Invasion of Privacy\n\nyes, this may be a legitimate concern generally. however, it is true of many technologies aside from echo. you have not argued sufficiently that echo is worse in this regard, or provided any actual evidence that privacy has been invaded. the potential for harm to occur is not the same as harm actually occurring. if we banned technology based on the potential for harm, we'd have to ban basically everything: kitchen knives, leather belts, baseball bats, you get the idea.\n\nin summation, i have shown that your position on this issue is flawed in specific and demonstrable ways. you cannot make the claim you're making without updating or revising your position, and therefore must change your view.

It really becomes a question of definition, which in this case is entirely subjective. You can probably find a formal definition for God which makes your statement \"true\", but it will still not reflect actual people's actual belief."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

For the plan to work, one would have to show that average happiness would increase and that the oppression inherent in the prohibition on commercial copying (taking into account the nature of the organization required to enforce that prohibition) would not outweigh the benefits; a calculation that seems to me impossible to make. What we do know for sure, if a prohibition on commercial copying is implemented, is that individual rights will be violated. \n\nHomesteading ideas / ownership extends to what we create: I have no problem with people owning their ideas. I don't suggest that they be extracted from their brain or deleted from their computer. Copying adds more of an idea, it doesn't take it away from its owner. \n\n\n\nFirst Reply:\n&gt;Theft: copying something can't possibly be theft because theft requires taking something away and copying doesn't do that.\n\nThinking about IP violations as theft (defined as depriving someone of their rightfully owned property) is, in my mind, a wrong way to go about it. Ownership of something doesn't just mean you have possession of it, but that you have the right to *control its use.* We talk about violations of IP as \"theft\" when in reality, it is closer to a violation of the right to control the property. \n\nSo if a person has a patent on a widget, he has the right to license and control the use of that widget. If he doesn't think it should be used in, say, weapons manufacturing- he has the right to deny the use of his IP in that field. \n\nNow say that a weapons company ignores this and uses the widget anyway. He has been wronged in two senses: first by loss of profits from the use of his widget (wherein the thing stolen is the *profit*, not the widget itself). Second, in the *control of the use* of the widget. The weapons manufacturer didn't deprive the inventor of *possession,* but he did deprive the inventor of *control.* \n\nSo while it may not be theft of the property (on your definition of theft), it *is still a violation of property rights.*\n\nEdit- To the economic utility point: I'm not sure I get your point. The argument in favor of IP is that IP will not be developed without protection for use and profit. This seems clearly correct: say a corporation could steal any patent from any inventor and deprive the inventor of profit or control without fear of reprimand. What incentive would the inventor have to devote time to inventing? What incentive would any person have to do research, when they would not be able to profit from the research.\n\n&gt;What we do know for sure, if a prohibition on commercial copying is implemented, is that individual rights will be violated.\n\nHow?\nSecond Reply:\nTo go in a different direction, \"intellectual property\" doesn't exist, so it's not even property in name only. [It's basically a propaganda term that has become popular only recently, and covers very different sets of laws: copyright, patents, and trademarks.](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.xhtml)\n\nSo maybe you can be more clear. Do you for instance have any problem with trademark laws? Should someone be able to make shoes and slap the name Nike on them? Do you have a problem with patents, like every shoe company not being able to instantly use some new material/configuration introduced with a new Nike product? Or is your CMV simply about copyright, and may be rewritten like 'Copyright violation is not theft'?"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I am a westerner who has had exposure mainly to western film but also enjoys many other film types and cultures including Japanese and anime film.\n\nHowever, I don't much care for Studio Ghibli stuff. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that I don't like it. Except for Hisaishi's music, which I think is beautiful. I don't know why everyone seems to like these films so much. \n\nIt bothers me as lots of my other views in life are congruent with the norm, or I can see why they vary.\n\nI've watched lots of Ghibli films in order to give them a chance. I've already heard lots of people arguing that the artwork is great (and I do agree it is) and that's what makes the film great, but that doesn't cut it for me; the same people who argue in this way don't seem to apply that logic to the other films they watch and so must be adapting their viewing style for Ghibli or just repeating something they heard somewhere else, not responding as they normally would (perhaps with reference to direction, plot, acting, action, scripting, etc) when asked why they like a film.\n\nAny comments or thoughts (outside of 'the artwork is so good') would be appreciated.\nFirst Reply:\nOne thing you should know is that virtually every Studio Ghibli film revolves around a coming-of-age plot. The plot throws challenges and quick change at immature characters that are unprepared for it, they must adapt and must be brave and show what's inside, their internal struggle is often emphasized.\n\nAlso every character, good or bad, has motives and development. Yubaba the bathouse owner is not evil just because, she's got a business to run. The witch of the waste is heartbroken and proud, which leads to wrath. Lady Eboshi cared about her town, employing the marginalized lepers, starting nothing short of an industrial revolution, albeit forgetting the damage to the environment. \n\nThe braveness of characters is also rarely your macho western protagonist willing to face and slice million monsters and then self-immolate. The braveness is often displayed by vulnerable characters that have much to lose and don't have the skills or the strength to chop their way to victory, they must be cunning, firm, and rely on their (often newly made) friends if they want to succeed. \n\nAll this combined with the art and the music, like you mentioned, makes just about every Studio Ghibli film a masterpiece.\nSecond Reply:\nI'm unaware of many people who rate movies based on specific criteria outside of movie critics themselves. And even then, most are willing to accept that a movie can be a gestalt, a sum greater than its parts. And even then, critics also accept the visual and spectacle of a movie as being part of whether it's good. Your analysis (or expectation of how someone else would analyze a movie) is almost all technical, which does not speak to the quality of a movie and how it can actually affect people.\n\nSo, here are a few things usually part of why Ghibili movies are considered great which also apply to western movies.\n\n1. Visuals. Especially in an era of nearly-realistic CGI, the sheer awe of a visually stunning movie are part of what make it good. When people put Jurassic Park on their lists of best movies, it is in part because of how gorgeous the visuals were. And how that creates the important sense of wonder that drives the rest of the film. See also Gravity. Or the Lord of the Rings, which was lauded in large part for looking the way that movie should look.\n\n2. Characterization. None of the characters are evil for the sake of evil, or lack convictions which are (at the very least) understandable. The Noh isn't malicious, just misunderstood. Now think about how often bad action movies are slammed for lacking good characterization beyond \"gritty tough hero\" and \"bad guy for no apparent reason.\" That scarecrow from Howl's moving castle has more characterization without *speaking* than Tony Stark has gotten in five movies.\n\n3. Cohesive, character-driven, plots. Benefits of having good characters is that the plots are not macguffin-driven or rely on happenstance or sins of convenience for resolution. \n\n4. Acting. Yep, even animated characters can act. First, they're damned expressive as characters. Second, the voice acting is top-notch.\n\n5. Stories, both relatable to the audience and unique. Yes, it takes a bit of suspension of disbelief to believe in the world of Spirited Away, but not much more than the suspension of disbelief for the Avengers. And once that's taken care of, the story itself is relatable. A young child who irresponsibly acts, and needs to fix it? That's old-school Spielberg at his best. A man who has acted selfishly is confronted with the need to consider others (and love) and risks himself to protect others? Yes, some of them are silly, but the ones people consider among the best movies are ones which resonate.\n\n6. Emotional impact. This comes from the characters being fleshed out and relatable, but there are none but the most hard-hearted who don't tear up at the goddamned scarecrow in Howl's moving castle. That's a more significant emotional impact *without* having to resort to ham-handed tear-jerking."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Like other left-leaning movements, it seems to have good intentions, but I actually think it does more to silence non-privileged voices than it does to encourage education, empowerment, progress, or harmony.\n\nA college education (or at the very least, the Internet and plenty of time on one's hands) seems to be a standard cost of entry for dialogue with a typical SJW. Dialogue that consists of terms and concepts such as: patriarchy, heteronormativity, trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF), cisgendered, gender spectrum, gentrification, respectability politics, privilege, oppression, identity, assimilation, queer, otherkin, institutionalization, marginalization, etc....I could keep going.\n\nThese are all terms that I've just pulled directly from SJW Tumblr pages/comments. Some are more easily defined than others, but there are still layers to each concept (such as privilege or oppression) that people may have a difficult time grasping if it was the first time they've been exposed to these ideas.\n\nHonestly, I have a master's, and the first time this language was thrown my way, I felt dumb for not understanding some of it. How might someone who could only afford a high school education feel? I get that they want to use intelligent, specific language to explain some concepts that are difficult to put into words, but how is someone who doesn't have the privilege of a college education, or at least the time to sit down and learn these concepts, expected to engage in dialogue that sounds like it's spoken by a women's studies textbook? It can be intimidating, and no one likes to have a conversation that makes them feel stupid. How is this use of privileged language encouraging those who are economically and educationally marginalized to participate?\n\nI don't want to generalize, but from my own experience, a majority of SJWs enjoy doing what they do because they like winning arguments. It's not about empowering and educating. In the face of ignorance, SJWs tend to belittle and insult, rather than educate or allow for a balance dialogue. The attitude is, \"Oh, you're ignorant? Let me make you feel *more* ignorant by insulting you and using words you don't understand.\"\n\nAgain, I'm in favor of most ideas SJWs tend to champion...transgender rights, #BlackLivesMatter, feminism, etc. I just think they're going about it in a way that turns people off, because they're so concerned with being able to flex their knowledge and with shutting down those who might disagree with their ideas the tiniest bit.\n\nFirst Reply:\nAcademia has always been like that. Mind you, a lot of \"SJW's\" are college students, they're used to this style of talk about social issues and mimic it on tumblr. The way it's always been with social activism is that there's a sort of \"ivory tower\" side and a more \"hands on\" side to it. \n\nThe latter organizes youth groups, teaches people about racism on their local school or community center, it organizes things like pride parades and history month celebrations.\n\nThe former is deliberately all talk, its efforts go towards identifying and naming the phenomenons that surround the injustice and discussing solutions. \n\nThis is not a new thing at all, take socialism for example, you had the academic elite discussing about concepts with big words and citations to lofty philosophers, there was the side that came in contact with people and riled them up or informed them. Also take how sociology professors talk about microagressions and mental colonization, while black advocacy groups take those ideas and rather than preaching about them go into action to stop them. None of them does more than the other, they need each other to be effective and thorough.\n\nI think there are several problems with how \"SJW's\" are handling activism, but their academic or pseudo-academic approach is not it. Refusing to educate others is regressive and a problem, yes of course, but the fact that advocacy includes complicated concepts and words is a nonissue. \n\nSecond Reply:\nOn the subject of specialized language, couldn't you say the same thing for pretty much *any* specific area of discussion?  For example, American football has dozens of similarly inaccessible words for those who haven't taken the time to look them up.  These words aren't any harder to learn than any other.  It just so happens that some words (and the things they represent) come up less often in everyday conversation, so the average person is less likely to already be familiar with them.  This is not even the slightest bit unique to \"SJW\" words.  \n\nExample: if you asked me what a linebacker was, I would have absolutely no idea what the answer was, besides that it's a position in football.  (And for the record, I'm a 20-something year old male living in North America.)  Yet I don't accuse football of being elitist because I haven't bothered to check what these words mean before trying to talk football with people who have.  As for when there are lots of \"layers to each concept,\" what does this really mean?  These layers exist not because of some SJW conspiracy to keep outsiders out, but because ideas like privilege and marginalization are genuinely complex issues that you can't become an expert on overnight.  \n\nBut you can still do some basic research on simple definitions quite easily, and learn the rest as you go along - just as you would with literally any other complex idea.  I don't think that's too much to ask, and it's what education is fundamentally about to begin with.  It seems strange to accuse something of \"doing little to educate\" on the grounds of there being lots of things to learn."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I believe altering Mother Nature is wrong and could cause (and probably already have) serious problems.\n\nI do not support GMO's and do not want to consume them. Many other countries have restricted GMO's because they don't consider them safe alternatives. I personally don't believe that we should mess with the composition of the natural world. Especially on this level, where about 80% of our food is GMO in the U.S. We don't know enough about it to widely accept them in the country, as there could be long-term effects. We already know cancer, obesity, heart disease, autism, mental illness( especially anxiety and depression), and diabetes is a growing problem. \n\nWith this whole GMO labeling issue going on right now I definitely think everyone has the right to know what they are eating, because not everyone wants to consume food that's in essence a science experiment. \nFirst Reply:\nThe thing is that there is not any substantial, substantiated link between GMOs and any of the health concerns you have outlined. There have been many, many different studies done on GMOs in order to verify their safety, and only a small handful have turned up potential risks (and those studies had major flaws, and the results were not reproducible). \n\nAlso if you fear that your food may be a \"science experiment\", you should be surprised to learn that your fears should pretty much apply to every food you eat. As just one very small example, as a means of pest control, some organic crops are sprayed with natural insecticides produced by a type of bacteria  called *Bacillus thuringiensis*, because they are both \"natural\" and non-toxic to humans. Now the interesting thing about this is that one of the main strains of GMOs is genetically modified so that the plant itself produces this exact same protein, rather than having the protein (or the bacteria themselves) sprayed on it. \nSecond Reply:\nI also agree that everyone has a right to know what they're eating. I disagree with just about everything else you've written.\n\n&gt; We don't know enough about it to widely accept them in the country, as there could be long-term effects.\n\nThere have been many, many studies that have demonstrated the safety of GMO crops. Let's start off by [reading the statement by the American Academy for the Advancement of Science](http://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/AAAS_GM_statement.pdf) that addresses many of the common concerns. I'll quote: \n\n* In order to receive regulatory approval\nin the United States, each\nnew GM crop must be subjected to\nrigorous analysis and testing. It must\nbe shown to be the same as the parent\ncrop from which it was derived\nand if a new protein trait has been\nadded, the protein must be shown\nto be neither toxic nor allergenic.\nAs a result and contrary to popular\nmisconceptions, GM crops are the\nmost extensively tested crops ever\nadded to our food supply. \n\n* The World Health\nOrganization, the American Medical\nAssociation, the U.S. National Academy\nof Sciences, the British Royal\nSociety, and every other respected\norganization that has examined the\nevidence has come to the same\nconclusion: consuming foods containing\ningredients derived from GM\ncrops is no riskier than consuming\nthe same foods containing ingredients\nfrom crop plants modified by\nconventional plant improvement\ntechniques.\n\n&gt; We already know cancer, obesity, heart disease, autism, mental illness( especially anxiety and depression), and diabetes is a growing problem.\n\nIf you're implying that consuming GMO foods causes any of these diseases, then you're wrong. Science disagrees with you. A [widely-circulated paper](http://www.skepticalraptor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Seralini-Final-Paper.pdf) that claimed to show that GMO food caused health problems [has been debunked](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22287-study-linking-gm-crops-and-cancer-questioned/?DCMP=OTC-rss&amp;nsref=online-news). But those who rely on making the public afraid to promote their own agenda aren't usually receptive to proof that disproves their claims.\n\nLet me know if you need more proof /u/Londiebug13, there's a ton of research I could show you to demonstrate the safety of GMO foods.\n\nEdit: formatting."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The (exaggerated) culture surrounding TWs of the blanket avoidance of those topics and the overzealous labeling of 'offensive' content is not only something I do not support, but also not the topic of this CMV.\n\n\nTWs and Spoiler Alerts serve the same purpose of alerting the audience to content that they may not be willing to expose themselves at the time - be it a graphic depiction of a corpse or who died in the most recent episode of Game of Thrones (which could very well be the same image). While many support the latter, the former is reviled in some circles.\n\nI think the argument for supporting the latter applies to the former: Just as you would like to avoid/be alerted to spoilers until you've gotten to that point in the story (you're 'narratively' prepared), it makes sense to alert others of content which may be emotionally distressing so that they can engage with it when they're emotionally prepared.\n\nYou could say that there's a presumption of eventual engagement with Spoiler Alerts, you wouldn't be worried about them if didn't plan on following the story. With TWs, someone could duck out of all triggering content forever. But that doesn't seem to be reason to denounce TWs as a whole: you're still saving that person and many others (who could be working to overcome those triggers) undue emotional distress.\n\nYou also could argue with my definition of emotionally distressing content, stating that it very easily leads to a slippery slope ending with everyone having to tag all of their content, but I'm not terribly persuaded by that argument. For one, regardless of a individual communities definitions of spoilers (we all know Snape killed Dumbledore by now, right?), endings and most recent episodes are universally considered spoilers. Similarly, I'm sure that sexual violence and gore can be considered universal triggers. Discovering how broad a community's definition of spoilers/triggers is done by engaging with that community. As for giving TWs being too much of an inconvenience, I think that's more of a matter of getting used to it: you extend that courtesy when discussing spoilers, why not for when you're discussing triggers? \n\nFirst Reply:\n&gt; TWs and Spoiler Alerts serve the same purpose of alerting the audience to content that they may not be willing to expose themselves at the time\n\nI disagree with this. The goal of a spoiler alert is typically to allow a fan to prevent herself from being exposed to the content *for the purpose of seeing later and being more affected by it*. The goal of trigger warnings, or what people worry is the goal of trigger warnings, is to avoid being exposed to the content *at all*. \n\nPeople don't think trigger warnings are ridiculous because they think others will see the warning, take a few minutes or even days to mentally prepare themselves, then read the article. People are worried that others will decide they categorically don't want to be exposed to a certain kind of content and will then shroud themselves in ignorance about it. This is troubling in specific cases where having good information about these kinds of things is important (suppose someone decided discussion of the vaccine-autism link was triggering to them), and in general if we wish our society to adhere to a high epistemic standard. (Or even the educated people in our society; people are demanding college lectures be trigger-warned.) \nSecond Reply:\n&gt;  that could reasonably produce an involuntary negative response\n\nThis is all conversation.  Me simply disagreeing with you both *is* and *produces* a negative response.  I think that the biggest problem people have with trigger warnings is twofold; the air of sanctimony people have when demanding them compounded with people overusing it and therefore draining it of its meaning.\n\nIt's like the [NSFL] tag.  That tag does exactly the same thing as a trigger warning without all the social justice baggage.\n\nThe problem with comparing it to spoiler alerts is that we mostly agree that to a good extent, [it's on *you* to avoid the spoilers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8IAhI-B6UU)\n\nThere's no give and take with trigger warnings, no compromise.  And it's tone policing which always puts people on guard."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Answer first or second only\u3002"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Original Post:\nCMV: (NSFW) One needs proper consent to masturbate about someone.\nConsent, I think we can agree, is a basic requirement for sex to be a positive act. Consent allows for there to be communication and reassurance between whoever is involved that what they're doing, and how they're doing it, is okay with their partner(s). Consent also allows for things that would otherwise be creepy or weird to come into a positive light and expressed in a healthy way. I would consider the act of objectifying to fall under this category. For example, a woman may be creeped out if a dude right in front of her at a party is just staring at her boobs without any concern for her at all. The same act of staring at the boobs is 100% fine if it's with her boyfriend while they're having consensual sexual relations.\n\nIf we take this same line of logic of consent that happens with sex and put it with masturbation, that's where I'm going with this. If you're thinking about another person in a sexual manner without them knowing about it, and then acting out that thought process by masturbating, it just seems a bit creepy to me. If I'm not allowed to objectify or do other sexual acts in person without having consent from the other person, I don't see how that wouldn't also translate over to masturbation. It's the same sexual thoughts, feelings, and intentions with the only difference being that the partner is not physically with you. Because they're not there with you, you can't ask for proper consent unless you physically ask them some other time if you can masturbate about them.\n\nThis line of thought has logic to it, but it's a conclusion that I don't like to face. This line of thought potentially makes masturbation an awful act if done without consent. It also makes it an act that wouldn't be allowed if no one gave any consent to you. You might be able to say that pornography that was paid for might be consensual masturbation because the model is being paid, and is therefore willing to consent to you masturbating. Even so, this doesn't allow you to explore your sexual desires outside of straight up porn unless someone says it's okay. If you asked me whether I'm for or against masturbation, I would say that I'm very pro-masturbation. The act has health benefits, relieves stress, is pleasurable, and all sorts of other fun goodies. It makes it so I don't want to come to the conclusion that I've come to that it needs strict consent about the person(s) that's involved in one's fantasies.\n\nSo please, CMV!\n\n\nThanks guys. I felt like I must've been wrong with my logic somewhere, and you helped point to where. I needed that. :)\n\nFirst Reply:\nA few things. Firstly, to assume that you could avoid thinking of a particular person during masturbation, even if you wanted to, is ridiculous. While humans can govern the content of our thoughts to some degree, you do not have the power to govern what you think 100% of the time. Even if you made the effort, often times trying to avoid thinking about something is the surest way to guarantee that you will think about it.\n\nFor instance, whatever you do, DO NOT picture a semi-automatic handgun right now! If you are like most people, you have already done so, as the suggestion itself plants the idea and the brain conjures up the image automatically. It doesn't require any effort on your part. There's no way to self-regulate this kind of thing, let alone have others regulate it for you (or even observe the process).\n\nThere are two different levels to consider this from. The first is plausibility. Your idea isn't practical, as it isn't something you could guarantee, even if you wanted to.\n\nThe second piece is that your suggestion above implies is that other people's thoughts about you are your business. I would argue that they are not. My thoughts about the world are a representation of my inner conditions, not yours, and I will gladly and happily think whatever I like about you and you will likely never know it unless I choose to act on those thoughts via word or deed. Most of our thoughts are really just background noise anyway and our thoughts have varying degrees of consciousness associated with them, so the degree to which you can attribute intent to particular thoughts is highly questionable.\n\nAnd what of intrusive thoughts? Intrusive thoughts are a phenomena whereby we have unplanned thoughts that are sometimes disturbing in nature that simply materialize and were not planned at all (like being near the edge of a cliff and thinking about jumping).\n\nWhile regulation of behavior is important, because it directly affects the well being of others livning in society, thought is neither something that you can fully control, nor something that directly affects the agency of another (unless we act upon such thoughts).\nSecond Reply:\nLet's put aside your specific argument and just think about what's more important.\n\nThe role of consent in sexual relations isn't just there for its own sake, it's there to reduce harm and trauma in society. Consent is a basic function of an independent, free society where individuals can have autonomy over their own body.\n\nIn your first case, the boob staring is a border issue. By entering a public space, you are opening yourself to be looked at by other people. You have a reasonable expectation not to be *leered* at, but still, that's merely an expectation. Just like you have a reasonable expectation not to be called an idiot and challenged on every opinion you have upon first meeting someone, it's merely an expectation. It's part of the shifting social climate of etiquette.\n\nNow, in terms of your consent concept, I think it falls on several faces. First, in terms of a net harm, I think most women/men would agree that someone they barely know telling them they want to masturbate to them would be unsettling. If they were in relationships, it might affect their relationship, and perhaps their SO's relationship with this person. Since the masturbation icon is neither aware, nor directly affected by the act, and being informed of the intention is usually worse than being masturbated to, it follows that they better of the two options would be to not be informed about it.\n\nFinally, it's fundamentally unenforceable. Person A informs Person B they want to masturbate to them. Person B says no, that creeps me out, please don't. What happens next? Only Person A knows if they are honoring the request, and Person B is now given a nasty little reminder about this person every time they interact. Their thoughts might randomly drift to this person, where they then remember the request, and suffer anguish from not knowing if they honored the request or not. Even if they ask Person A, it's not like they can prove they haven't.\n\nSo, I get the general idea of your position, I just think it doesn't really apply all that well in practice.

And yet, the vast majority of people have no idea how to type without looking at the keys and often hunting and pecking. I personally consider this a major problem because I think it is holding us back to some extent.\n\nSome points that I use to support this argument:\n\n1. Faster typing = more productivity, businesses would benefit. You could do more paperwork, more homework, anything on the computer. I'd argue that if everybody could type, we'd all have more free time as well, or at the very least GDP would increase as we get more work done in less time. \n\n2. It's useful for personal and professional activities: Even if all you do is type posts on facebook and write an email to your grandkids, knowing how to type will help you.\n\n3. It's easy to learn. It's all muscle memory, and if you practiced for an hour a day you'd be good in a month. Plus there are programs galore for it. \n\nSo, my view is that if university required you to know how to touch-type, perhaps with a modest WPM test on entry, or at least a freshman-year course, people would be forced to learn it and would become better typists, thus benefiting everyone down the line. \n\nWhy university? Because minimum wage workers don't usually need to type on a computer, making it less necessary at the high school level. Also, in university, you'll be typing a hell of a lot. I don't care what course you take, you'll need to type up essays and ultimately a thesis paper. \n\nAm I overblowing this? To quote the great Mugatu, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. To me it's at least as important as learning how to write with a pen these days. I'd just like to understand why society currently seems to place no value in this skill, and that maybe I'm overreacting. \n\n\nWell, thanks for all the comments, it's been a very interesting discussion so far. \n\nThe argument that's hanging onto me the most is that the keyboard may become obsolete, but I can't see that happening soon enough to justify ignoring a useful skill.\n\nFor those who point out that we can learn it of our own free will and it's not the university's place, I feel that the long-term benefits of such a policy change benefit us in the long term. Universities often require you to study other things they feel are beneficial, such as learning another language (which is often taught inadequately), so I don't feel that it's outside the potential scope of a university to require typing.\n\nAnd for those pointing out that it isn't worth the time, I maintain that learning costs next to nothing, and it saves you time over the course of your life if you add up every time you type.\n\n\n/u/cheeseboyardee made the point that not everyone learns at the same rate and some people may not be able to learn to type well, and thus mandating it could exclude otherwise capable people. \n\nThanks for all the posts and cordial discussion. \n\nFirst Reply:\nIn middle and high school my school mandated typing classes. Typing \"the quick fox jumped over the lazy brown dog\" over and over again for an entire week with a piece of paper covering the keyboard. \n\nI topped out at about 30 WPM after 10 weeks of the course with more typos and misplaced spaces than are appropriate. (About 20 WPM if I was copying text.)\n\nBy looking at the keyboard I actually slow my mind down to focus on the word I am typing at the moment instead of getting ahead of myself. Moves me up to 40-50 wpm with fewer mistakes. To catch up to how fast the words go through my head I would need to be closer to my reading speed (300ish WPM).  The speed difference trying to touch type is unbearable, the increase in allowing myself to see the keyboard helps make it bearable. \n\nOffering touch typing courses is going to be a good idea. \n\nRequiring it for admission is not. Especially in countries that have massive disparities between school districts in terms of the availability of technology. Not every student has regular prolonged access to a keyboard or the internet in order to develop that skill. \n\nSaying anything is \"Easy to learn\" leaves off the second half of that sentence. Which is \"...For me.\" Other people have different skills and abilities and learn different skills at different rates. Even something as simple as singing a simple tune is nearly impossible for some. \n\n\nSecond Reply:\nI'm an engineering grad student, and I never saw a need to type faster. If you're writing so quickly that you're limited by your WPM, you're probably not being very concise. For example it takes me about 10-20 hours to write a 3000 word paper. \n\nBased on your reasoning, speed reading would be 100x more useful than being able to type fast. Would you support a mandatory speed reading class for everyone?"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I believe that if someone is willing to forcefully take from another innocent person with the threatening use of a knife, gun, or other easily lethal weapon, they have no place in society and have a fundamental defect in their human brain chemistry (without even touching on the trauma and psychological damage the victims must suffer).\nTo me, this type of crime shows an extreme amount of depravity. You're brandishing a weapon, ready to kill a person you do not even know, for short term profit. This especially applies to home invasions and store robberies.\nThe reason I added the 'positively identified' caveat is that I don't want to leave any room for putting an innocent person to death, so for this case to kick in, I would need either CCTV confirming their identity, or multiple eye witnesses confirming their identity. \nI'm willing to admit this view may be on the extreme side, but I like to think I'm a reasonable person and I'm open to change.

Another example: in the top 20 states with murders per 100,000 people, or rather, in the top 20 worst states for murder rates, only 5 do not have the death penalty. In the top 20 states with the LOWEST murder rates, 12/20 do NOT have the death penalty. It can be argued that punishment is not a detractor of criminal behavior. [Source](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/murder-rates-nationally-and-state#MRord)\n\n2. As a personal anecdote, my apartment was broken into when I was just a year out of college. My girlfriend at the time came home to find the house had been broken into and apparently the people had just left. She went upstairs and found a knife from our kitchen, upstairs in our bedroom. So the robber had broken in, taken the knife from our kitchen and brought it upstairs with him in case he met anyone up there, I guess. But who is to say his intent? Was it scary as shit? YES. Did it make me feel very unsafe in my home? YES. But I also know that some robbers carry weapons solely for personal protection and not to actively harm people. Some robbers take them and use them to scare or intimidate people. Who is to say that it was ever their intention to use it on someone? Seems a pretty stiff penalty to give someone the death penalty when you could never truly know their intentions or if they would have gone through with it.\n\nEdits made for spelling, punctuation and just generally awful flow of the paragraphs. Hopefully most have been caught and ~~killed~~ I mean, uh... fixed.\nSecond Reply:\nIt doesn't seem like the moral arguments are changing your mind, so I'll try taking a different approach. The death penalty for armed robberies would be insanely, unrealistically expensive.  Death penalty cases cost way more than even life in prison, because we want to be really really sure we're right before we execute someone.\n\nLast year, according to the FBI, there were about 345,454 armed robberies in the US.  The actual costs of a death penalty case vary, but somewhere around $1,000,000 seems like a pretty common estimate.  So, in a year, we're looking at about $345,454,000,000.  Is that really worth it?  Are the benefits (reduced crime rate, comfort to the victims...) really worth the 300 BILLION dollar price tag?  Who's paying for that?  Is that really the best use of the money?\n\nMorality aside (and for the record, I'm very morally against it), death penalty for armed robbery would just be too expensive.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/violent-crime/violent-crime-topic-page/violentcrimemain_final\n\nhttp://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The article from the Federalist was spread on tumblr, and eventually popular user katara [reblogged with the full context](http://hunty.us/post/125041947641/hillary-clinton-lets-be-honest-black-men-in) of the quote, and people started criticizing the people passing around the articles for taking things out of context / not doing their research.    \n\n(Here's where my opinion comes in.) I think that tumblr's reputation of false alarm and out-of-context sound bites isn't unique to tumblr at all, it's the way popular American media has operated for the last few decades- if not more. [Many](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/09/18/just-the-scandal-of-the-week-or-a-turning-point/the-news-media-and-its-soundbite-culture) [people](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/byron-williams/our-sound-bite-culture-sh_b_93720.html) have discussed the \"sound-bit culture\" that becomes especially popular in presidential election cycles. Given that this is the norm for modern day news, I think politicians have a responsibility to avoid creating problematic soundbites.   \n\nSpecifically, I think Clinton doesn't deserve the sympathy she's getting from [people](http://bleecake.tumblr.com/post/125130165347/hillary-clinton-lets-be-honest-black-men-in) who feel as though the media took her quote out of context. Clinton has been a politician for DECADES, she's got more experience than practically anybody- she's gone through 2 successful presidential election campaign as a candidate's spouse and this is her second presidential campaign as a candidate herself. She's been in more controversy over the years than anybody can keep track of. She's got almost unanimous support from the Democratic party, and lord knows she can afford good speechwriters and campaign managers. So why in the hell would she deliver a speech with the sentiment of basically \"Black people are scary... is what a racist would say. Racism is bad.\" Surely, she knows people are only gonna take the first bit of that clip, and they're gonna run with it.    \n\nTo me, the fact that this \"quotable\" passed through all the levels of Clinton's campaign team is just an indicator of how little anyone working for Clinton (including herself) really gives a shit. She could wake up tomorrow and say she intends on starting a nuclear war with Iran, and she'd still get the Democratic nomination. Because of that, I think the media has the right (and responsibility) to challenge Clinton. A good candidate is a candidate who's speeches can't be misquoted/taken out of context.    \n\nWe (the American people) are not getting the candidate we want or deserve, because we keep tripping over ourselves to help out Clinton.\n\n\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nMany of the problems we face today (institutional racism is a good example, but so are climate change, income inequality, and partisan gridlock) are extraordinarily complex in their causes.  Any meaningful discourse about real, workable solutions to these complex problems will necessarily need descriptions that defy brief, quotable sound bytes.  You say \"a good candidate is one who's speeches can't be misquoted/taken out of context\"-- in other words, you are asking for a candidate whose speeches consist only of empty platitudes, and ignore all issues that are sufficiently complex as to require some \"setup lines\" in order to explain.  \n\n\nWhile it is true that the media prefers to focus on out-of-context sound-bytes (because this allows them to engage in low-effort, high-reward \"gaffe journalism\"), we the American people should push back on this tendency if we are ever to have any hope of a public discourse that is actually constructive.  You may be so cynical as to believe that no politician will ever be willing to take up these problems meaningfully; nonetheless, that's how our system is designed, and if they don't, no one else can.  Part of our responsibility as citizens is to demand accountability not just from our elected officials, but from the news media who cover them.  The Internet has actually revolutionized fact-checking, and made it very difficult for erroneous or misleading news stories like the one you describe to survive very long before being called out.  This, in my opinion, is a good thing for democracy.\n\n\nAs a final note, I want to make a particular comment on your statement that \"we keep tripping over ourselves to help out Clinton.\"  I'm not sure who the \"we\" in this statement is meant to refer to, but the [news media has a famously frosty relationship with the Clintons](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/10/after-two-decades-of-hostility-can-hillary-clinton-change-the-dynamic-between-her-and-the-press/) and certainly is not looking to do Hillary any favors if they can help it.  \nSecond Reply:\nThe ability to never misspeak or have such hollow speeches that nothing can be taken out of context is not a good indicator of someone who will be a good legislator or executive. In the current climate of 24 hour news and internet fury over a mistake we are doing ourselves a disservice by keeping qualified people out of politics.\n\nWho are the types of people who have no skeletons in their closet (or paid to cover them up) and do research to figure out how people will react to every word you say? Only the rich and most power hungry. By saying everybody ought to speak perfectly all the time we are selecting the most out of touch people to be fun our government. It's really concerning actually."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying professional golfers aren't extremely talented, golf is not easy, but compared to anything else, it's nothing. In every other sport, your skill set has to be very large, and you have to be very good at many things. Baseball for instance; you need to be able to bat, field and run. In soccer, you need to be fast, be able to pass, and shoot. In basketball, again, you need to be fast, be able to pass, and be able to shoot. But in golf, you just have to be able to hit a ball towards the hole, and you can only do that one way.\n\nFirst Reply:\nHitting a golf ball is one of the hardest things to do in sports.

It's flippin' hard.\n\nMuch less hitting it with any sort of accuracy.  Much less the different types of shots you need to be able to do well.

The transaction was complete and she had control. If the coffee had been spilled during the handover I would view it the other way around.\n\nThere are two arguments that I reject. I reject that the severity of the injury affects the responsibility. Comments such as \"have you seen those injuries, they're horrific, she had to be reconstructed\" are common. This is true, they were appalling injuries. But I think this is a strawman argument because my point is that it was not McDonald's responsibility after the handover, not that the injuries were minor. \n\nI reject that the coffee was too hot. These are hot drinks. It's obvious to me, and I would hope anyone who intends to drink such a drink that it would be hot and care should be given. Perhaps my culture views it differently. I grew up in England, and here 9 and ten year olds make tea for themselves; kettles boil water and then that water is poured into a teapot / cup. We know from a young age that this is dangerous and extreme care must be taken when handling such hot water. Indeed, in a similar UK case against McDonald's regarding hot coffee, the judge ruled that McDonald's was not responsible, one of the reasons being that people expect hot drinks to be hot and should make reasonable safety measures themselves. I do not believe Americans don't realise hot water is dangerous.\n\n If anyone would like to comment, I'd be happy to elaborate further. I look forward to having interesting discussion.\n\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nAs I see it, you're arguing from the wrong stand point. \n\nYour view is mostly based around the notion that customers should expect a hot drink to be hot, and therefore handle it carefully. This is logical and thus at a first glance seems like an argument in the context of this lawsuit.\n\nHowever, it is irrelevant because it is not mutually exclusive with the notion of serving (easily tippable, might I add) hot drinks that will not cause severe (3rd degree) burns in the event of the cup tipping over. Something we can very easily observe when you look at just about any other establishment that sells coffee.\n\nThe loose thread in your reasoning is as follows: should customers handle hot drinks carefully? Yes. However, should establishments sell hot drinks in handheld, plastic cups that will cause you 3rd degree burns if spilled? No. And the thing is that there is a very extensive middle ground in here, to which all establishments selling this sort of items adhere to.\n\nFor this reason, McDonald's was found liable.\nSecond Reply:\nI think the important thing here is *why* she won the suit.    \n   \nThe jury never found that McDonald's was entirely responsible.   \nThe award was given to the plaintiff based on the principle of 'Comparative Negligence'. This principle isn't applied in all jurisdictions, but it *is* used in the jurisdiction wherein the incident and the lawsuit took place.   \nAccording to this doctrine the plaintiff can be awarded damages even if they themselves contributed to the damage.    \n    \nSo taking all of the evidence that McDonald's was *to some extent* responsible, they were also to some extent liable.    \n   \nGiven the over-heated coffee they carried some liability; but I think more importantly they intentionally down-played the warning on the coffee cup. That was probably done to make the cup more aesthetically pleasing, but it nonetheless seats them with some responsibility.   \nThey took their own warning to their customers and made it negligible so that the cup would be attractive.    \n   \nI don't think it can be argued that McDonald's carried zero responsibility for the incident and the law in that state makes it clear that they are therefore liable *to some extent*.

I'll use the most \"accepted\" version of the story: \n\n*Jesus was one with God, part of the Holy Trinity and one day he decided humanity should be saved with the ultimate sacrifice: his own life. In order to do that he came to Earth and lived like a normal human, teaching his ways to others. 30 and something years after his human birth he met his fate. Tortured and humiliated he sacrificed his life to give humanity a chance of redemption, he was the Lamb of God. After that he was resurrected and went back to heaven to live like god for the rest of eternity* \n\n\nAlright, this is a big deal because a divine creature came to Earth to sacrifice himself for humans, an unthinkable act. Problem is, Jesus choices were:\n\n1. Save humanity and suffer a lot of pain for a couple months (if you consider the very act of becoming human a bad thing, then let's say 30ish years) and go back to Heaven\n2. Not save humanity and stay as god forever\n\nProvided you're not completely cold and oblivious being, 1) is clearly the only logical choice here, you are trading an infinitely small piece of your life for saving an entire race that you created, why not? Compared to eternity the suffering is meaningless. It's like if for giving 1 cent to a person Bill Gates could save that persons life. Of course he would. Anyone would. You don't need to be pure goodness to do that, not even close.\n\nSo, what is the merit of Jesus sacrifice? \nFirst Reply:\nLet\u2019s start with your framing position!\n\nTo begin with, Jesus\u2019 pre-incarnate status as divine is (based on the biblical text) poorly understood at best (although John certainly though he pre-existed). Positions have been argued most vehemently both ways, but his pre-incarnate state is, to us, basically opaque. I\u2019ll not take a position here, except to say that the way you framed this question would have to be considered pretty speculative. Let\u2019s work with what\u2019s recorded, instead!\n\nTo talk about Jesus\u2019 sacrifice and why it might be important, you\u2019d have to talk about who he is, and what he represents. You\u2019ve alluded to this in your question, but what do we mean when we say Jesus is the Lamb of God, and why does that matter?\n\nJesus is the Messiah; that is, he is God\u2019s anointed (in the same way as Saul, David, and Solomon) to be God\u2019s king and representative to the Jews. There had been many, many other anointed in the past; every king of Israel was messiah. Jesus was claiming that office. The miracles of Jesus\u2019 ministry are in part signifiers of his credentials. That is, he\u2019s demonstrating that he actually is sent on God\u2019s authority.\n\nThe difference here is that Jesus is pushing for an expanded understanding of God, His law, and His kingdom. Jesus in the gospels is claiming to be the king who is prophesied to usher in God\u2019s kingdom and begin the rule of God on earth. His claims and stance, coupled with the miraculous signs like healing, caused a high degree of polarization in the contemporary Jewish community.\n\nThat said, let\u2019s take another look at your framing question, as it seems to be the foundation of your perspective. As you\u2019ve set it up, it kind of sounds like Jesus is saying \u201cHeigh ho, better pop off to Earth for a spot of the old redemption, what? Oops, pesky humans, with their crucifying! Well, back to eternity; at least the blighters have a chance now.\u201d\n\nInstead, let\u2019s take the text at face value and look at it as Jesus is recorded to have done. This is a man who should have been treated like what he was, a prophet of God, a king and Messiah, and the representative of God to man. If those things are true (and we\u2019re assuming they are for this argument), then respect and devotion are certainly appropriate responses. Jesus\u2019 entire ministry is him pushing people to a clearer understanding and a refined relationship with the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This would all have been well within the understanding and history of the contemporary Jewish culture Jesus was in. There\u2019s even precedent in the prophets for what Jesus was doing.\n\nNow, it seems clear that Jesus himself knew that he would be killed. He alludes to it throughout the gospels (I shall raise this temple in 3 days, etc.). When we get the garden of Gethsemane, however, Jesus is incredibly stressed. He clearly does not want to be crucified, to the point where he is sweating blood. This is where we can answer your question with more accuracy. Jesus is not doing this because he wants to or because it\u2019s easy. In fact, in the text, he\u2019s not even doing it to save humanity. In Matthew 26:39, he asks not to be killed, and says that he does this because  it\u2019s the Father\u2019s will.\n\nSo, whatever Jesus\u2019 pre-incarnate state, whatever else he might have done, however the kingdom might have manifested with his continued survival, in Christ\u2019s crucifixion we can understand the term Lamb of God. This is a reference to the lamb of the Passover, the sacrifice whose blood on the lintel will signify your obedience to the Lord, and thereby spare you from death. It\u2019s a reference to the Exodus, and God\u2019s salvation of the Israelites from bondage. In the same way, Jesus\u2019 sacrifice frees us from the bondage and slavery of sin.\n\nThe merit in the sacrifice is that Jesus, so far the only human being who lived as God intended (that is, without sin and prioritizing God\u2019s will),  is brutally executed *while doing God\u2019s will*. His life and the manner of his death signify and confirm his authority from God, and that empowers him to be our representative, at once satisfying to God as doing as an actual human ought, and understandable to us because he\u2019s from our context.\nJust to reiterate, in the Scripture Jesus is acting like a human. There are things he doesn\u2019t know. The power he uses is from God. He\u2019s scared at the prospect of his execution. These are not the traits of an aloof divine being going through the motions. For Jesus, it\u2019s not a sacrifice of no value, but a protracted and painful (and humiliating) death.\nThe next logical question is to ask why a sacrifice is necessary at all, and that\u2019s a tougher one to answer. From the old to new testaments, sacrifice and death are always used to redeem sin. My understanding is that it\u2019s an illustration of the seriousness of sin and its consequences, but I\u2019d understand if that answer failed to satisfy.\nAnyway, hope that helps. I really rushed through this; there have been books and books written on this subject. If anything was unclear or you\u2019d like more info, I\u2019m happy to expand on any details.\n\nTL;DR: Jesus wasn\u2019t a detached divine being, according to the text. His sacrifice was at great personal cost. He was God\u2019s representative and rightful king of Israel (indeed, all the world), and therefore should have been treated as such rather than being wrongfully executed. His perspective was not one of giving away 30+ years out of a million billion, but rather one of being God\u2019s faithful servant within a limited human lifetime. The merit in his sacrifice is that he did God\u2019s will in his life to the point of unfair death at the hands of those he came to help, and that makes his sacrifice sufficient to repair our relationship with God, from God\u2019s perspective.\n\nSecond Reply:\nI'm very much a wild man in my faith, I wander the whole world's ideas and beliefs in search of truth. I was raised as a (Presyterian) Christian but had to reject all of it at a certain point in life. My return to Christianity has been very much a surprise, and made possible by setting aside everything that other humans have told me about God and Truth... including the Bible. I do still read the Bible, and seek out the perspectives of others. I also read many, many other things.\n\nChrist's death is the least relevant part of my experience of the divine. It's a little irreverent to say that, but it is just where I am at. I have heard the explanations and sermons, *ad nauseum*, about why Christ's death was a big deal. There's a lot of history involved, for one, about the prophecies and emotional-spiritual undercurrents of the Israelite/Jewish peoples and their journey and evolution. It takes quite a bit of research to really grasp in its true extent, given how insanely long ago all of this happened. (The cultures and peoples in question, and the world in general, looked radically different. Plus there's a language barrier to overcome.)\n\nAlso there are theological perspectives, built and expounded upon since Christ's death, which some people are really into. Christ being a bridge between humanity and God, Christ's death absolving all sins, all sorts of things that I have listened to at some length over the course of my life. And these things are ok I guess. I like some more than others, connect with some more than others.\n\nBut compared to the living truth I have met, the living spirit of consciousness and Life, the weird and wild and true Grace that has flown into me, and taught me what friendship even means, and shown me love and intimacy beyond what I could have hoped for, introduced me to intimacy in the first place ....ahhh it's truly incredible. Indescribable! Compared to this experience and love, the knowledge about this very ancient event, the death and resurrection of the man named Jesus, is well, just knowledge. It's an incredible story, and good to learn, but it's a little weird I think to focus on it so much. \n\nI'm sure my perspective will change subtly over time, but Christians focus so much on death and sin... they do so in order to show how God saves us from them. But if that's the case, why not frame it according to that premise? Talk about life and grace! That's more like how the spirit is with me.\n\nJust, pure grace. Pure soul. Pure music.\n\nSo while I have, in a way, not directly addressed your claim, I wanted to share my experience. There is a living spirit, call it the living spirit of Truth, or call it God, or call it the elegant cosmos, but realize those are just sounds we make, little squiggles we write down that try to correspond to a much huger reality than can possibly be contained in mere squiggles, in mere perturbations of the air. This living spirit is a Great Friend, is a deep well of Truth, Light, and Love. Instead of trying to use 2000 year old information (which wasn't recorded very well at the time, which was notoriously and shamelessly edited by political bodies, which was copied over and over by scribes who introduce small but Telephone-like errors, and then translated once or twice across languages) to evaluate the nobility and admirable-ness of Christ or the spirit which filled the man, probe the here and now. Ask the living truth to show you its nobility. Ask Christ to show you here and now whether he is admirable. And, crucially, wait for an answer.\n\n(Though this can be done alone, you might need to find a counselor, priest, artist, weirdo, musician, sheik, guru, yogi, or shaman to guide you through the morass of thoughts and feelings that keep our eyes shrouded.)\n\nI highly recommend reading (or re-reading) The Chronicles of Narnia. Aslan is to me a better portrayal of Christ than that given by most of the New Testament.\n\nArt and peace and grace to you"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Some of these professions will outright ask on the application if the person has a mental illness. Some people will say that certain professions are so important, that a person with a mental illness should be denied. But people who advocate discrimination against the mentally ill are simply misinformed about the fact that mentally ill people have the same rights as everyone else. While the media portrays mentally ill people as violent, this is simply not true. Mentally ill people are no more violent than the average person.\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nWell, I can see that, but in the case of police officers, what if the mental illness was one in which the person would be unable to make a rational split-second decision? Realistically, these are people who have stressful jobs and they don't know when or if they're going to face a violent criminal who might have a deadly weapon when they go to work every day and of course they're going to make the occasional mistake as it is. I think you mentioned training in other replies, but eventually the man with a mental illness is going to run up across a situation that hasn't been covered in training and that's when he might have a meltdown.\nSecond Reply:\nYou are misinterpreting training as a guarantee that someone can do the job well. Plenty of people can pass tests, go through courses, etc and still have issues down the line. All that initial training and testing is to weed out people who are obviously not qualified and ensure there are standards of basic knowledge/skills employees possess to do the job properly. Judging someone solely on such a short sighted and narrow view of their qualifications is simply not smart decision making, especially when others people's lives are at stake. \n\nAnd your definition of \"mentally ill\" simply isn't well developed enough to really be able to change your view on the issue. What disorders are you including? How can you make a meaningful statement about how violent they are if you are lumping a bunch of disorders together? Why are you only considering rate of violence when plenty of other issues that mental disorders could bring about would effect job performance.\n\nAlso you need to realize that we are not all equal from a performance standpoint. In the real world, we have different abilities to handle stress, perform under time constraints, etc. The issue is not whether someone can pass a test or qualification on a single day, it is can they repeat the same task everyday with little to no error. Someone with a mental illness may have more variation in performance because it is simply another variable taking away from one's ability to do a stressful job well. \n\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

So the question now becomes, If meat is not murder, then for what purpose should basic animals not be given the same right to life that a human is given? If we can agree on my third and fourth assumption then I see no reason why a basic animal should not be given the same rights to life as a human.\n\n**What Will Change My View:**\n\nDisproving one of my assumptions in a way that disproves my logic\n\n\n\nFirst Reply:\ni don't really care if you are a vegan or not but your logic seems flawed here. If a lion eats a monkey or a hippo, by your logic it would be considered unethical. Vegans would clearly argue that humans don't have to eat meat. I would argue that one cannot make a universal ethical argument on eating meat. Humans still today, subsist on hunting for wild animals in areas where resources for cultivation are scarce. To claim that meat is murder, you would have to believe that indigenous people in the world should starve to death or be locked in prison.\n\nIf you are planning on becoming vegan because you believe meat is murder, why then would you go so far as to not consume eggs or dairy? You can go buy free range eggs pretty easily in most places these days.\n\nI would further ask how far you plan on taking your veganism. Do you plan on using products tested on animals? Eating honey? Eating produce grown using animal fertilizer? \nSecond Reply:\nThe way I like to see this is kinda human nature. Survival of the fittest. Eventually, animals we eat could evolve to survive and not be killed off so easily. But you shouldn't think it's wrong. So you think that we should do our best to make bears stop eating fish? Lions stop eating gazelle? We do it because it's in our nature. We are stronger and smarter than a lot of animals we eat, so we use them to live. Survival of the fittest is pretty much the only thing you need to not see eating meat as murder. "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I am always trying to think of ways to introduce the music to a wider audience and get more people to love listening to classical music. \n\nSo here it is: I believe that the main reason people don't like listening to classical music as much as other genres is because classical music rarely includes a drum set. \n\nDefinitions I use in this CMV: \n\nClassical music: not only music from the classical period. I'm using the blanket term to describe any music typically performed by orchestras, or chamber ensembles. What a non-musician would think of as \"classical.\" Everything from Bach to Mahler to Bartok to Ives. \n\nPopular music: not just the narrow genre of \"pop,\" but the broad term to include anything listened to by a more mainstream audience. Could include anything from oldies, to country, to EDM, to metal, and beyond. \n\nNow to explain my view:\n\nI really don't think there's that much difference between classical music and other genres. \n\n-Both genres use the same 12 notes. (The exception obviously being microtonal classical music, which even as a career classical musician, sometimes I have a really hard time appreciating. But 99.9% of classical music uses the same 12 notes as popular music.)\n\n-Both use the same basic palette of harmonies and tonalities (major/minor chords, added 7ths, 9ths, etc.). \n\n-Both have the same basic choices of meters. (4/4 time, mixed meter, etc.)\n\n-Both use many of the same instruments. (Guitars aren't exclusive to popular music, and violins and 'celli aren't exclusive to orchestras.)\n\n-Both contain pieces with text/lyrics, and both genres also contain pieces that are purely instrumental. (A lot of people point to lyrics as the main reason they love certain genres of popular music, but both genres have music with text/lyrics.)\n\n-In the pieces with text/lyrics, both genres use many languages besides English. (Lots of people say they can't understand classical music sung in German, yet they listen to plenty of K-pop or songs in French and don't mind looking up a translation, or they appreciate it for other aspects besides the lyrics.)\n\n-Both genres contain relatively short pieces (3-5 minutes) and longer pieces (10+, or even 60 minutes+). (So the length of composition isn't really a big factor, since you can find both short and long pieces in either genre.)\n\nSo those are many of the similarities I can think of. But one thing that's really different between most (not all) classical music and most (not all) of popular music is the fact that the drumset (or electronic beat, or incredibly rhythmic or percussive strumming on a guitar, or vocal percussion, or something that makes a similar sound) keeps really obvious control of the rhythm at all times. It's really hard not to know where the beat is in popular music, whereas in classical music, sometimes the meter is a bit more obscure. \n\nI think that most people really like feeling their body or mind move in time with the music, and so the accessibility of the rhythmic feel in popular genres is appealing to a wider audience. \n\nContrast this to classical music, where sometimes, even to a trained musician, the meter is intentionally less clear. In most cases, the meter may be clear to someone who knows what they're listening for, but still not totally obvious to the average music listener. It gives people less of a rhythmic foothold into the piece, which I contend is the reason that people don't enjoy classical music as much.\n\nTo clarify: I'm not coming from a place of thinking classical music is better. I'm not assigning value judgments here, or trying to be an elitist. I'm merely trying to find what I would consider the main differences between classical and popular genres to be. And to me, the lack of a drumset (or other instrument that keeps the meter as a very up-front feature) in classical music seems to be the biggest difference that I can spot. \n\nOne final caveat: In this CMV, I'm mostly talking about listening to music on one's own, like at your house, or on your own iPod. I think the experience of attending a concert of classical music vs. pop music is a really different one. I don't blame anyone that thinks that orchestra concerts can feel a bit stuffy. So while people may enjoy the more energetic atmosphere at a popular music concert, I don't think there's much difference to putting on your iPod while you go for a run and listening to Beethoven vs. the Beatles when you're on your own and not in a concert setting. \n\nThe reason I'd like my view changed: I truly want to know the reasons that most people would have for not loving classical music so that I can address that in my future performance and teaching in the hopes of exposing a wider swath of the population to an art form that I love so much. I truly believe that classical music is universal and anyone can enjoy it. But I need to start by finding out the real reasons that people don't already listen to it. \n\nThe main thing that I think will CMV: \n\n-Compelling examples of features people like about popular music that are unique to popular music. Not features that are shared between both genres. I really want to find out what makes popular styles uniquely engaging to people in ways that classical music is not. \n\nTL;DR: Classical music almost never has a drumset to help keep really clear track of the time for the listener. People like feeling rhythmically grounded, and so popular styles are more accessible to a wider audience.\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nI disagree with your hypothesis. I think a lot of think  you list as differences aren't (it's very easy to feel a \"rhythm\" in most classical music) and most the things you say aren't are (small) differences.\n\nBut in the end, I think the answer is *very* simple. \n\nIt's not exclusive to classical music... it applies to *all* music that isn't \"popular\". It's just simply that most people aren't that into music in general and won't put the necessary effort (/time) in to \"get into\" a genre outside their comfort zone... be that something that isn't really *that* different, like Classical, or Blues, or Country, or something wildly different like Noise, or Free Jazz. \nSecond Reply:\nCould you be looking at this from the wrong angle? You're asking two completely different things: 1) Why people don't listen to classical music; 2) Is it because classical music doesn't have a drum set?\n\nThe way I see it is that most people stick with what they're used to or exposed to at some formative age. I know someone who listened to a ton of classical music because his father used to play it in the house while he was growing up. His dad was very knowledgeable about the composers, artists, etc. and passed that on to his son. I, on the other hand, was exposed to a ton of classical rock (from my friends) when I was growing up. That's still the music that I like the most, and he still likes classical music best. In fact, I didn't get into classical music at all (I'm still a noob) until I watched Requiem for a Dream and got blown away by the soundtrack - Kronos Quartet did an amazing job. Though my friend tried, I was resistant to it because of my own lack of \"training.\"\n\nThat's how it is with exposure to music. If you show me what's \"popular\" right now I would just stare blankly at the list. The whole Taylor Swift/Nicki Minaj drama meant nothing to me because I don't know a single song by Minaj. So it isn't a matter of the qualities of the music, it's more about exposure and discovery. Classical music isn't a presence the same way pop music is. I think that's what accounts for the difference in popularity.\n\nGreat post, by the way. Let me know what you think about my $0.02."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Mad Catz controllers. Performance memory cards. (Every generation of game consoles has this stuff but this particular gen stands out in my mind for it.)\n\nOn paper, these third party accessories were great. A Mad Catz Playstation controller was pretty much identical to a first-party Sony controller. Mad Catz controllers were cheaper too. But they were poorly made.

This just seems idiotic to me. Especially considering that only certain minorities have an easier time getting in, while others like asians have a much harder time. It should be based on your grade average and the score you get on your SAT (I'm from Canada so I'm not really sure how SAT score factors into that. I'm used to only your high school grades being counted). If an asian student gets a 90% average, his/her application shouldn't be tossed aside for a black student who only managed to get an 83% average. Maybe in the past affirmative action was necessary, due to racial bias. Nowadays it's completely useless and does nothing but inhibit asians and whites.\n\nI believe your race shouldn't matter when it comes to these things. It's like saying blacks and hispanics are more stupid than asians and whites and therefore should get some help to get into college. Also, before you say that it has to do with economic status, I would like to disagree. My family (including cousins and whatnot) came from very poor circumstances. However, most of my cousins have gone on to get degrees in things like engineering. If you don't do good in school, it's either because your capacity to learn in that certain subject or in general is lower than other people (say being bad at math or English) or you just didn't try hard enough.\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nCanada has a very different collegiate system to the USA. And we have a very different racial make-up as a result of us not really having had the same numbers of slaves or the same violent opposition towards civil rights. We also don't see quite the same level of disparity between racial groups socio-economically. Our disadvantaged minorities are less disadvantaged than those of the US. \n\nSo our universities don't really implement racial quotas quite the same way as the United States does. \n\nIn Canada the closest thing we have to affirmative choice is universities' treatment of aboriginal students - sometimes qualifying under separate categories and getting additional funding support.\n\nAnd that's contentious too, but it's not made to punish other people, it's really meant as an effort to help counteract the additional challenges faced by Aboriginal students in obtaining an education. One of the best ways to help aboriginal populations in general is to remove as many barriers to education as possible - people who are empowered and well-employed are great for their community. They're leaders and examples for youth, they're often able funnel money back into their communities for development, they're often better able to service their communities. Setting aside spots for them isn't meant to remove spots for white kids. It's not. Aboriginal students who make it to university often had to attend rougher schools on or near reserves. They're more likely to grow up in foster care. They're less likely to have university-educated parents.\n\nJust imagine that you're a highschool student living with your paternal grandmother - a woman who attended residential school. She didn't receive a great education - she probably left the moment she was able to because residential school was a shitty time for a lot of students and they got schooling that was far below the standards set for other students. When you're raised in an environment where school is a scary, violent, abusive force it doesn't necessarily breed the same academic support.\n\nThere are all these barriers that stack up together to make it really hard for them to get into the same programs.\n\nAboriginal special acceptance programs aren't meant to punish poor or disadvantaged non-aboriginal kids. They're simply meant to help provide clearer avenues for aboriginal students to access education.\n\nI think that's what affirmative action looks to do in the US. \n\nAffirmative action isn't perfect. You get advantaged kids in any race. But it's one of the best tools we do have for helping poor and depressed groups help themselves. Admitting their kids to universities helps them lift their communities up and that's worth the imperfections in the system. \nSecond Reply:\nI think there is a lot that can be said about subtle ways in which Black and Hispanic students are at a disadvantage in the admissions process, and I agree with other commenters who are making this point, but I actually want to come at this issue from a slightly different direction.   Consider the admissions process not from the perspective of the student, but from the perspective of the college.  The college's job is not to find and admit the \"best\" or \"smartest\" students, whatever that might mean, but rather to admit the students who are going to benefit the college the most.  Most admissions officers, especially at elite private schools in the U.S., will readily admit this if asked.  You can argue that this is somehow \"unfair,\" but remember that the first and most important job of a college is to maximize its own ability to do high-quality education and research.\n\n\nAdmitting a racially diverse student body helps the college achieve this aim in a variety of ways:\n\n1. It helps attract a larger applicant pool.  Some students applying to college value \"diversity\" and will choose to apply to colleges with visible racial minorities preferentially over colleges that are dominated by White students.  Conversely, very few students will cross a college off their list because it is \"too diverse.\"  So the college has nothing to lose and everything to gain in terms of attracting more applicants if there's more visible diversity.  Colleges would always rather have more applicants than they can admit because then they appear more selective, and thus more prestigious.\n\n2. It keeps alumni and donors happy (who value the perception that the college is \"diverse\"), who will then give the college more money which it can spend on things like increasing the quality of its programs or providing more financial aid to needy students.\n\n3. It increases the number of student perspectives on campus, broadening the range of discourse in and out of classes and leading to a higher-quality education as students are exposed to a broader set of ideas and experiences.\n\n4. It gives the college a broader alumni base in communities other than those dominated by Whites and/or Asians.  This helps increase the college's general name recognition and prestige. \n\n\nI should note that this approach to the admissions process is typical of private colleges and universities (and a few top-tier public universities) in the U.S.  It is much less true of large state schools and essentially nonexistent outside the U.S.  However, it is these same U.S. private colleges and universities that are most likely to use affirmative action in their decisions, so I think the point stands."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

He passed all of the blood tests (shy one, where the story of using a particular ointment for saddle-sores was concocted to explain it).\n\nDoping in one form or another is always going to happen, and there will always be another method that can escape detection. If you're a professional athlete, or an amateur competing in high profile tournaments such as the Olympics, then you either dope or you face a significant disadvantage.\n\nI don't think this will ever change, and the consequence is that every winner will be tainted by doubt, so I think the only way to address this is to change the policy to allow specific types of doping.\n\nBall-shrinking, liver wrecking, life endangering drugs would still be banned for the safety of the athlete, but anything that's either harmless (blood transfusions), or at the same level as \"professional hazard\" (like brain damage for boxers), would be allowed.\n\nOne of the things that encourage me to have this view, and that I'd like addressed if it's wrong, is my understanding that the IOC relaxed their criteria for gender verification. \n\nThe reason, as I understand it, is that there were simply too many legitimate side cases, so the hardline rule couldn't be enforced. Someone genetically male might have Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome or XX/XXY mosaicism, for example, and grow up looking like a woman to anyone but a gene lab.\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_verification_in_sports\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nDoping is only an advantage when a few athletes are doing it. \n\nOnce everyone is doing it, then it's a disadvantage just to get even competition.\nMany performance enhancers have significant health risks/side effects.\n\nWhy bother doing it when you don't even get an advantage anymore? \n\nIt's easier and healthier for everyone to ban it.\nSecond Reply:\nI think your premise that blood transfusions are safe is your biggest fallacy. When preformed by a medical professional, transfusions are very safe. However, when professional organizations do not forbid them they are tacitly endorsing them. This may not be a problem for the professionals who can afford medical professionals and sterile materials, but the kids who are trying to get to that professional level will almost certainly NOT have access to those benefits. They are the ones who will be forced to take risks.   \n  \nAnd your argument that it's going to happen anyway so we should not ban it is logically inconsistent. That is like saying people are going to steal cars, so we shouldn't have a law forbidding it. Just because some people do not obey the rules is not an argument that they shouldn't exist. In addition, those people violating the rules take on the additional risk of getting caught. Lance Armstrong is a prime example.   \n  "}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and that even many of the violent criminals who are jailed don't need to be locked up for as long to prevent them from being an immediate or persistent threat. In fact, I believe that long term incarceration under harsh conditions is something which actually causes further social harm \u2013 directly to the person incarcerated and to the society which the prisoner will be released into after an extended period of incarceration. Also, if the person has dependents, they too might suffer more if their material needs are not adequately provided for.\n\nSubsequently, if some sort of punishment is required for violating some sort of socially accepted institution, then I feel that some form of shaming, shunning, and exile are possibly effective alternatives to prevent crime before we decide to incarcerate someone for an extended period of time or issue fines which they may not be able to pay.\n\nOne advantage to this approach is that the punishment is more directly democratic. It's not a punishment which is wholly issued by a sitting judge who is appointed to represent the public and who arbitrarily decides a perpetrator's fate. Rather, the perpetrator, by agreeing to make public their offense, can still receive a certain degree of sympathy and forgiveness. And if they are shunned or exiled (for some indeterminate amount of time), then other members of the public can go along with that punishment to a degree they see fit.\n\nGranted, with shunning or exile the punishment would work much better with social cohesion, but if it were the accepted form of punishment then shunning or exile might be more readily accepted and enforced by the general population of an area. Admittedly, this is an aspect of society which would probably have to be reformed or evolve if a society chose to move away from incarceration, corporal punishment, and excessive fines. But if society is incapable of changing in this way... then I'm not sure society would be able to change in other ways which would make it sustainable and tolerable to live within.\n\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nWe already do exile people for certain offenses, namely sex offenses. That's the entire point of the sex offender registry. It ensures any individual on it will never own a home, live in a town of any significant population, or work a job ever again. It's publicly available and there are no shortage of websites dedicated to listing people on it.\n\nOf course, being an ex-con in general exiles you from society to varying degrees. Many jobs become permanently off-limits to you, as does housing and education opportunities.\n\nAs for public shaming, we do that already too. Read your local newspaper. There's almost certainly a column dedicated to showing the pictures and details of everyone arrested that week. Courts are usually open to the public as well.\n\nShunning is inherent with all of these actions. Most people don't want to associate with a felon.\n\nSo since we already do these alternatives, we already know the results, and they're pretty bad. As it turns out, cutting people off from opportunities only makes them *more* likely to offend. After all, if you went to prison for dealing drugs, met a bunch of other drug dealers and suppliers there, then get out to find most jobs and learning institutions won't even look at you anymore, do you settle for a months long search to find a crappy minimum wage job, or do you use your prison connections to forge an even more lucrative drug dealing career than what you had before?\n\nAs for exile, like in the case of sex offenders, it's really bad. By giving these people nothing left to live for, you've removed all incentive to act on good behavior. There is going back to prison, but if you're homeless and off the grid how are they going to find you? With that ankle monitor you took off?\n\nAs for shaming, it can be psychologically traumatic (which will do anything but make a person less likely to offend). The founding fathers were expressly against it as a form of justice as they considered it cruel.\n\nBut what about deterrence? Studies have shown that the severity of punishments has rapidly diminishing returns on deterrence factor. In other words, you do need to make sure that the punishments aren't so trivial that people consider them nothing to be worried about, but beyond that it doesn't matter. Why? Criminals don't really consider the potential punishments when committing crime. Either because it's something down impulsively without much thought, or because they think they won't get caught so why worry about the punishments?\n\nFinally, many of inmates in the US corrections system have severe psychiatric illnesses. These people aren't served by being in prison, and they wouldn't be served by other forms of punishment either. What they need is psychiatric treatment, or possibly long-term institutional care (ie living in an asylum).\nSecond Reply:\nThe problem with both the prison-industrial complex and your proposed solution is that both are guitly of kicking the can down the road: the punitive encarceration of people who break the law often leads them to be *less* able to rejoin society and to change course from a life of criminality. This is caused by institutionalization, things like long-term isolation, being victimized sexually, physically, and mentally while an inmate, and especially the restrictions and difficulties which newly released ex-cons have to face.\n\nIt's very difficult for an ex-con to get a job and a place to live in, *especially* in an area that is reasonable and which doesn't have lots fo crime. So they get stuck in a shitty job working for the minimum wage, most likely living in a shitty neighborhood where they may be exposed to crime. It's basically a recipe for failure. If you got busted for drug dealing then you're stuck working in a factory making no money and being treated like shit, wouldn't you want to go back to selling drugs so that you could make a reasonable living in a n occupation that doesn't require a clean criminal history?\n\nBut you already know this.\n\nThe problem with your idea of public shaming and exile is similar. People are publicly humiliated for the crimes they commit, so *everybody* in the community knows about what they have done. They will essentially be outcast, just like an ex-con in the example above. This will lead to more criminality as well.\n\nAnd as for exile? Well, if that ain't the worst kind of kicking the can down the road then I don't know what is. Pushing criminals out of your community into someone else's is terrible NIMBYism. Exiles will likely end up gravitating into what amounts to a social leper colony. There's no jobs, there's no way to contribute to society, there's only other criminals around you who are all just as down on their luck. That sounds like a college for criminal learning and a recipe for creating gangs.\n\nSo what are these two alternatives really missing? \n\nWell, I've already explained the problem of not having a rehabilitative goal for incarceration or exile. And that's a huge problem. Another problem is that there's no restorative justice &amp;mdash; a person burns down a building then gets kicked out of society. What good does that do for the person she is left with a smouldering foundation? It's better to put the guilty party to work *rebuilding* what they burned down because then they have to face the consequences of their actions and they have to face up to the building's owner and the hardships that their actions have visited on this person.\n\nThe other problem with exile is that &amp;mdash; and I truly believe this &amp;mdash; there are some people who are not capable of rehabilitation. It isn't many people, but there is some small slice of the population which are unrepentant psychopaths and child molesters. Basically they *need* to stay in a place where they can't cause more damage to society. That doesn't mean locking them up in a dungeon or in permanent solitary confinement, but by the same token exiling them would condemn another community to go through the same horrors as yours did.\n\n*Edit*: also \"democratic punishment\" sounds a *lot* like mob justice. Look at what reddit did when they tried finding the Boston Marathon bomber. There needs to be someone/some people who are somewhat impartial or otherwise people will be found guilty before there's even a fair justice proceeding to establish who did it and why they did it. (I don't think that our current pay-per-justice system is the right approach to this, but I still believe that in many ways it's better than mob justice). P. S.

Many consider it a restriction of free speech and ideas. But why do people get upset with the censorship of books, and not movies or video games?\nIf you are under the age of 17, you are not allowed to see a rated \u201cR\u201d movie without a parent. But you are allowed to go to a bookstore and buy any book you want, no matter how controversial the subject matter. Why is it okay to censor movies and not books? Like books, movies contain ideas, messages, and provoke thought and conversation. I have seen movies that have changed my way of thinking. Most of those movies are rated \u201cR\u201d. How is it fair to restrict teenagers from experiencing the stories and ideas of this particular medium, while allowing those same stories and ideas through literature?\n\nThe same thing goes for video games. There are video games that have been banned from western countries because of content. Oftentimes, game developers have been forced to edit the content in games (depict less blood or sexuality) in order to legally sell their product in a country. This is censorship, plain and simple. They are banning art and ideas because they are controversial and make people uncomfortable. Could you imagine what would happen if we did this with books? Banned them unless the author edited, rewrote, or removed certain scenes? There would be an uproar.\n\nHere is a list of some video games that have either been censored or banned in certain countries:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regionally_censored_video_games[1]\n\nSome people might argue that we are stricter with movies and video games because you can actually see the violence rather than just reading about it. But I don\u2019t really buy this argument. In high school, I had to read \u201cThe Sorrow of War\u201d by Bao Ninh. For those of you who haven\u2019t read it, the book is extremely graphic and violent. There were vivid descriptions of people stabling and shooting each other in the face, tanks running over and crushing bodies, and torture. One of the main characters is raped in graphic detail. Profanities, including words like \u201cFuck\u201d \u201cShit\u201d and \u201cCunt\u201d are everywhere. The fact that a 16 year old is allowed and encouraged to read this book, while at the same time banned from watching 22 Jump Street in theaters alone (a movie that is rated R solely because of the language\u201d), is baffling.\n\nTo be clear, I do not agree with regulation and censorship at all. But since we enforce it on games and movies, I think that books should be held to the same standard. CMV.\nFirst Reply:\nI think there's an important distinction between age limits and outright censorship.  \"Censorship\" in the political sense means that you are suppressing or editing a book, movie, or another work on the basis of the words and ideas contained inside it being deemed \"unacceptable\" by some authority figure.  The problem with censorship is that it abridges the freedom of adults to choose the media they consume and to expose themselves to whatever content they want.  \n\n\nMPAA and RIAA ratings, on the other hand, are age limits that apply only to children under 17.  They aren't removing these movies or video games from the marketplace of ideas, or even preventing children from seeing them.  They are just giving parents the choice about whether to expose their children to those media, rather than allowing children to have that choice themselves.  Rightly or wrongly, children under the age of 17 are under the guardianship of their parents, and our society and our legal system gives parents to make certain choices on behalf of their children until they reach a certain age.  You can argue that age 17 is arbitrary, but I think most people would agree that children below SOME age are not really capable of deciding themselves what media is appropriate to consume.  So then it's just a question of picking where the arbitrary age cutoff is.\n\n\nAge limits on books are actually quite common.  It is illegal for example, to sell erotica to children, and many bookstore chains have also adopted their own content limits in terms of what books they'll sell to young kids.  Parent groups and others will often force schools and libraries to ban certain titles (or to remove them from school curricula) for putative \"graphic content\" or political controversy.  Morally, this doesn't seem to me much different from the MPAA/RIAA rating systems; the only real difference is that it's done on an ad-hoc basis at the consumer level, rather than nationally by an industry-wide board.\n\n\nAlso, I agree with u/forestfly1234 that the layer of interpretation needed to understand graphic content in books provides another layer of protection (generally, in my experience as a teacher, kids who are old enough to understand what they're reading are usually old enough to handle the content, and the same is definitely not true of movies.)\nSecond Reply:\nIf you're reading a book you have to interpret what you're reading. If you a six year old read a rape scene and have no idea what a rape scene actually entails you're probably going to not really understand what that scene is trying to depict. \n\nThe kid is protected by not having any idea as to what he is reading, so the rape scene has no context for him. He probably is protected because he can't read the thing in the first place. Books provide protection that movies and games don't.\n\nIf I show the movie Hostel to a 6 year old the violence is already really dedicated for him. That kid just has to sit back and watch. he isn't protected by his ignorance. Everything is just laid out to see. \n\nShould 6 year olds be able to watch Hostel?"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

People balk at the idea of flying around in something filled with explosive gas, yet it seems to me that airliners, when they go wrong, are often just as (or more) fatal to their occupants. The Hindeburg disaster only killed just over a third of the people on board; the majority of airliner crashes kill everyone on board. Overall, the death toll of conventional airplanes, though small, has vastly exceeded that of airships, yet it is airships that retain the reputation of being death-traps. \n\nThe truth is, airships were an idea that was completely out of step with its times; during the period where they were most economically viable, materials and engine technology, among many other things, were barely adequate to deal with their demands. An airship built to Zeppelin scales with modern materials technology and design techniques would be dramatically stronger, lighter, faster and safer, with aramid fibre skins stretched over composite frames. They would have satellite navigation and meteorology, and onboard weather radar to avoid dangerous weather; computerised systems would monitor hydrogen pressure and static build-ups, modern escape and fire suppression systems would provide a final back-up. Moreover, there is the potential to use solar power and electric motors to run these flying behemoths essentially for free, making them far more economically viable, both for passengers who don't mind a slower, more stately trip and for container cargo. You might even be able to use onboard generated power to crack water to produce hydrogen to replenish losses, though I'm not sure how feasible that would be.\n\nAlso, it's very hard to deny that airships are really fucking cool.\n\n\nFirst Reply:\nWe should bring back airships, but only for a few niche applications. One such application is [military transport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhVBuBgfXrE). (Under permissive tactical conditions mostly, I would assume). Airships like the one in the video have the excellent advantage of being able to lift huge cargo loads over land (albeit slowly) and unloading their cargo without any infrastructure (like cargo handling equipment, a runway, personnel). Using a rigid airship for disaster relief in locations where all the transportation industry has been destroyed (or never existed) is a perfect application.\n\nThe slow speed makes this impractical for commercial transport applications.\nSecond Reply:\nThey are slow, stupidly huge, a lot more fragile than planes, the useful mass/volume to total mass/volume ratios are obscenely low, they are very susceptible to metereological conditions (a strong wind will blow them back), and they aren't even that incredibly efficient fuel wise (using solar is NOT viable in any shape or form, especially considering that they are slow, the night has no sunlight, and they fly lower than most clouds) to make the idea interesting for niche applications"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}
