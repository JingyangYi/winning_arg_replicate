{"input": "CMV: Political candidates who refuse to detail their policies are making the right choice. + \n + Every election year this is one of the most popular complaints against  candidates: lack of detailed policy prescriptions. \n\n* \"So and so says he's going to reduce the budget, but so far he hasn't offered any specifics.\"  \n\n* \"Hillary says she has a plan for restarting the Israel-Palestine peace process, but so far nobody has been able to nail her down on the details.\" \n\n* Recently right here on one of the CMV posts about Bernie Sanders, /u/bayernownz1995 says that \"Sanders *does* have a solid page on racial injustice on his site, but it is a little weak in terms of actual policy prescriptions. Compared to O'Malley's page, Sanders has a lot of work to do.\"\n\nYou hear these complaints all. The. Time. In newspapers, on blogs, on TV news, in debates, etc. Candidate X offers no details, they're evasive in answering questions, they're canny, they give bland lip service to a problem and make happy talk about solutions, but they never *actually say what it is they're going to do if elected*. It's like the default setting of oppo research, a ready-made criticism to hurl at a candidate if you don't have any meatier, muddier dirt to fling their way. \n\nBut the thing is, there are very good reasons for candidates to be evasive. For one thing, if they were to offer actual policy details during a campaign, then they'd spend the entire rest of the campaign defending and arguing about those details. If someone found an error or mistake or potential pitfall, they might have to revise their plan -- revise a policy that doesn't even exist yet! Political opponents hire specialists in opposition research, and the more material those specialists have, the more they'll be able to distract and distort your candidate's plan in order to make them look bad. Giving them an entire piece of draft legislation, or an entire detailed budget document showing cuts and spending, etc. would be like a godsend to the oppo research people. And all for what? For an imaginary policy that doesn't even exist yet. No candidate in their right mind would open up so many vulnerabilities all for the sake of a policy that doesn't even exist outside of the candidate's website. \n\nSecondly, no political candidate is running for the office of dictator. Whether someone is running for President, Senate, Congress, Governor, state legislator, dog catcher, etc., the important thing to remember is that politicians have to work with other politicians, and agencies, bureaucracies, other constituents, etc. They have to work with other people to get anything accomplished. So if you get elected to office with a complete, massively detailed economic stimulus package combined with spending cuts and tax cuts, don't expect every other member of Congress to just roll over and rubber stamp your policy. Politics isn't beanbag, and you'd get crucified by the players in Washington (or any other capital). Oh, you promised you were going to cut the F-22 fighter? Well guess what, that's going to throw 60,000 people out of work in my district. And you want me to just vote for it because *your* supporters voted for you? How about f--k you?\" \n\nIf you got elected with a detailed policy proposal, everyone in the government responsible for putting your policy into motion would have you over a barrel. Every change they make to your policy would threaten to make you a \"liar,\" a judas, a traitor, etc. to the people who supported you, as well of course as your political enemies. Your policy details would become a millstone around your neck and a gun to your head. Your friends and enemies alike would be able to use all of your detailed promises on the campaign trail in order to wrap you around their fingers.\n\nSo that's my view: politicians would be insane to offer detailed policy answers to any given question, and they are wise to stick to vague generalities, advertising language, happy talk, etc. Can you think of a good reason for politicians to spell out their promises in detail? \n\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: The first goal of the human race, from a currently living humans' perspective, should be to achieve AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) + \n + This CMV was inspired by this article on the future of AI http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html\n\nI recommend reading it a lot, its a great read, but extremely long.  Anyways, in the article it talks about the rise of AGI, Artificial General Intelligence, or AI that's equivalently as smart as a human (the human equivalent is fairly unimportant, a self-learning AGI would go from the dumbest human to the smartest in a fairly insignificant amount of time).  Anyways, the article then talks about the upcoming ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) in which AIs would be unfathomably smarter than us.  Imagine how much smarter we are to ants and how a lot of the things that we regularly think of ants can't even conceive in their brains.  That but worse, and the AIs are the humans and we are the ants.  Now the article talks about a lot of implications of this, but one large implication is that it could lead to species extinction, or species immortality.  The former because it could wipe out humans for our relative uselessness (maybe more useful as raw meterials) and the latter because we could either digitally store our consciousness for eternity or rejuvenate our bodies by continuing to reconstruct any bodily decay, atom by atom, quark by quark, etc.  Anyways, scientists have no idea right now what will happen, especially because the AI is so much smarter than us that we can't predict the possible outcomes of what it will do, whether killing or saving us all.  \n\nBecause of that, some scientists say that we should be as careful as possible approaching the AI so that we don't accidentally create an ASI that will destroy all humanity.  But for current humans, we're going to die anyways, so the extinction of a human race is just our eventual death that will happen regardless.  But we have one shot at living forever, one way or another, and with our own interests in mind, we should try to get there as fast as possible so that we have the highest chance of achieving our own immortality.  If we mess it up, then we die anyways, but if we achieve species immortality its the ultimate prize, as contrasted to being cautious and dying before species immortality is achieved.  And secondly, if we use the model of our own brains in making this AI, then even if it does kill us all, part of us will love on within AI.

{"input": "CMV: One of the best ways to help against Inequality would be to give men paid maternity leave aswell + \n + Whether employers admit it or not, one of the biggest hurdles for women wanting to get in jobs is the possibility that they may at one point get pregnant and have to leave work for an extended period of time, meaning the manager has to find a way to make up for the work the woman may have done, and have to pay them while they are away. This leads many people to have at least a small bias is the idea that hiring a man will be more permanent and a higher chance of more potential profit in the long run.\n\nHowever, if the man who conceived the baby also got maternity leave, this would mean the risk is equal no matter what gender you hire. During maternity leave, the man would take care of the child with the woman, allowing for both of them to take care of the child, and allow the child to get more recognition of the father. \n\nThis may also help stopping the idea that a women is necessarily the one who has to take care of the child, another stereotype that is often regarded as bad.\n\nThis could also theoretically help with rare events such as when male homosexual couples get a women (who would not raise the child) to birth the child for them given that they can\u2019t.\n\nThis would ofcourse not solve all the problems with inequality in the genders, but I think this might be a good way to help (although since I\u2019m posting it here, obviously I\u2019m not /sure/ it\u2019s a good idea)\n ", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: NYC sucks + \n + I used to want to live in NYC, but after travelling there multiple times and talking to friends who have lived/currently live there, I could not be more dead set against ever moving there. In fact, I have come to despise that place. As a quick note about the perspective I have: I'm a 3rd-year law student. I grew up in South FL, and currently live in Boston, MA. I'm not a stranger to life in a northeastern American city; maybe city life in general is not for me, although I do like Boston *much* better than New York. \n\nFirst, it's filthy. There is trash *everywhere*, the water is polluted, and the air simply does not smell clean. Being an old Northeastern city, it's filled with old buildings, many of which are in varying degrees of disrepair. It's just generally a dirty, sad place for me to be. \n\nIt's also crowded. NYC has ~8.5 million people crammed into around 300 square miles. To walk anywhere, you must wade through a sea of drab, disheveled humanity. The public transit is packed. Driving in NYC is one of the most hellish experiences I've ever had.   \n\nThe cost of living is exorbitant, as everyone already knows. Rent alone takes up most of my friends' paychecks, and their places aren't even that nice or spacious. New Yorkers seem like they pay through the nose for a standard of living that ain't that great.\n\nThen there's the climate. The winters are frigid and soul-crushing, complete with biting wind and extended periods of low sunlight or darkness. The summers are sweltering, and the heat only exacerbates the ever-present smell of rotting garbage. Plus, central air is apparently only for the wealthy northeasterners, because it is conspicuously scarce in most homes/apartments I've visited. \n\nI can't understand the allure of that city. The wealthy live comfortable lives while most everyone else pays through the nose to live wretchedly. People get an inexplicable sense of self-importance and accomplishment simply by moving there and living there for a bit, regardless of what they're doing. Maybe I'd feel accomplished too, if I paid $800/month to live in a cardboard box and resisted the temptation to commit suicide by antagonizing the psychotic, fascist police to which NYC is a home. \n\nTL;DR NYC is a crowded, dirty, dismal place and I cannot ever picture myself being happy there.

{"input": "CMV: Bernie Sanders is at least as electable as Hillary Clinton. + \n + I'm planning to vote for Bernie in the primaries but, if Hillary gets the nomination, I'll still vote for her in the general - I will do anything in my power to help make sure the next two SCOTUS nominations are not controlled by the GOP, end of story. \n\nThat being said, there seems to be this idea that Clinton would be a lock for the presidency but, if Sanders were to get the Democratic nomination, it becomes possible or even *likely* that the GOP will take the presidency. If that were *true*, then it would behoove me to support Clinton in the primaries, if I really am committed, above all else, to keeping the GOP from taking the presidency in 2016.\n\nMy primary reason for believing that Bernie Sanders is *at least* as electable in the general as Hillary Clinton (I actually think he's *more* electable, but that's immaterial to this CMV) is a set of thought experiments, which simply revolve around considering the behavior of individuals/groups voting (or abstaining) in 2008/2012, how that behavior would respond to Hillary being the nominee, and how that response would be *altered* by having Bernie as the nominee instead. For ease of illustration, I'm going to use Jeb Bush as the stand-in/proxy for the eventual Republican presidential nominee - if you think the GOP will likely nominate someone else, and it will make a difference in how a significant number of people vote (or abstain), feel free to specify why/how in your reply, and then proceed within the context of your chosen Republican presidential nominee.\n\n-----\n\nSo, here are some examples of the general form of the thought experiment - this set of examples is, by no means, comprehensive, but I've yet to think of one which significantly advantages Hillary over Bernie:\n\n * Describe to me the person or demographic, who voted for Obama in 2012, who would vote for Hillary over Jeb in 2016, but who would vote for Jeb over Bernie in 2016. (Impacts: Swing votes)\n \n  * Now describe to me the opposite group (Bernie&gt;Jeb&gt;Hillary) - which group seems larger?\n\n * Describe to me the apathetic Democrat who, once they are familiar with Bernie as a candidate, is more energized by Hillary than Bernie. (Impacts: Democrat turnout, i.e. harmful abstentions)\n \n  * Now describe to me the opposite group - which seems larger?\n\n * Describe to me the Republican who would make it to the polls to vote against Bernie, but would be like \"meh, fuck it\" and not bother to vote against Hillary. (Impacts: Republican turnout, i.e. helpful abstentions)\n\n-----\n\nNow, outside of that form of argument, one thing I've seen cited as evidence against Bernie in this respect is a particular Gallup poll, regarding attitudes towards those who identify as socialist:\n\n\n\nMy problem with that is as follows:\n\nEvery one of those descriptors, except for socialist, is a largely apolitical identity - whereas being \"a socialist\" is a political ideology.\n\nThe phrase \"just happened to be [black/Muslim/Jewish/a woman]\" implies that the nominee would have said identity, but would still mostly follow the tenets of whatever \"your party\" was - whereas \"just happened to be [a socialist]\" implies an ideological leaning that potentially conflicts with whatever you feel \"your party\" stands for.\n\nTherefore, comparing the numbers for \"a socialist\" to all those other identity-based descriptors, without also including numbers for \"a conservative\" and \"a liberal\" simply doesn't provide a useful context in which to interpret the numbers for \"a socialist\".\n\nI also think that, due to the way the question is asked, the poll winds up *seriously* underestimating the impact of *strategic voting* (i.e. voting for the candidate with the best chance of beating your least preferred candidate) against the GOP - I think it's just plain ludicrous to suggest that 41% of Democrats would prefer Jeb Bush to Bernie Sanders, simply because of the socialist label, but maybe I'm wrong on that point?\n\n-----\n\nAnother argument is that the GOP media machine will be able to use the socialist label to get their base frothing at the mouth and drive turnout (this relates to the 3rd example thought experiment).\n\nMy feeling here is that, considering that has been Fox news' sole purpose for the last 8 years, they are already well beyond the point of diminishing returns - there is no part of the base, who is amenable to this sort of strategy, who isn't *already* frothing at the mouth, socialist or no - trying to use the socialist label to wring *even more* turnout from their base, at this point, is trying to squeeze blood from a stone.\n\n-----\n\nFinally, while the GOP's fear/anger-based strategy for motivating turnout is a finely-tuned machine at this point, turnout among Democrats is much more variable - so many on the left feel entirely apathetic towards the party, so turnout is unreliable.\n\nI will admit, I don't even know exactly why, but Hillary seems to *personify* what people on the left are apathetic towards - nobody, *nobody* I've talked to, on Reddit or IRL, seems excited about Hillary. On the other hand, among those who have become familiar with Bernie as a candidate, he seems to energize people in a way that I've simply seen no recent evidence of *any* other potential candidate even coming close to.\n\nSince voter-apathy seems to be a fairly huge problem on the left (relative to the right, at least) this seems like a *huge* point in Bernie's favor - especially because it could also have a fairly significant impact on Congressional races.\n\n-----\n\nOne last thing: I know the socialist label is a big part of this discussion, but I don't want it to devolve into an **exclusive** focus on that - I am interested in how Bernie stacks up *against Hillary*, so if you are going to talk about how people respond to the socialist label, please keep it in the context of a comparison with how people respond to Hillary as a political fixture.", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

Context and intended meaning are everything. + \n + I recently posted [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAVufRsalw0) in a thread. I just meant it as a jokey response to someone's comment, but some people took offence to it. Apparently, because the actor playing the character isn't black, that makes this blackface and therefore unacceptable and offensive.\n\nTo offer some context, this is from a show called facejacker which is a follow-on from fonejacker. Fonejacker was a show about one man making prank calls and playing characters. You never saw his face. Mostly what you got was the audio from the conversation and an animated still picture representing the character [like this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA3zhzT1wDo). So, the blackface character in the video above was developed for fonejacker. It's just meant to be an amusing accent that plays off people's image of a \"Nigerian scammer\". Because he was such a popular character, he was brought back for facejacker. The concept of facejacker was to take some of those characters and turn the actor into them with make-up so he could go out and prank people face to face. So, the character came first. It's meant to be funny and it's meant to play off certain stereotypes people have, but it isn't racist and shouldn't be taken as such.\n\nThis is one example of many. I just think that only context and intention of the author can determine if something is racist or not. I also believe that we should be moving towards a world where a black actor can play a white character and a white actor can play a black character and no-one cries racism because racism just isn't an issue anymore. The problem is that this kind of knee-jerk reaction (he used the N-word, he's a racist / he's in blackface, so he's a racist) does nothing to help us achieve that, but in fact holds us back by emphasizing racial differences and causing arguments. \n\nTL/DR; You shouldn't call things offensive just because they've fulfilled some basic criterion (like use of blackface or the n-word for example), you should actually examine the intentions of the author and the context to determine whether or not something is truly offensive.\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: Nearly all landlords should allow dogs in apartments + \n + I have lived in Boston for nearly five years and am currently searching for my 3rd apartment in the area (my moves have been because of either price or commute). I have a small dog (12 pounds, 5 years old) and my probable roommate also has a dog (70 pounds, 10 years old). During each move, I have had trouble finding a landlord who will accept dogs, and finding one that accepts two feels nearly impossible. \n\nI have always received full pet deposits back and have reference letters from previous landlords, but this does not seem to factor into their policies. The most common reasons they bring up are noise, yard waste, and possible damage to apartment (mainly floors and walls). Having lived next to families with young children and beneath freshly minted college graduates, I cannot understand the bias against dogs.\n\nYes, my dog barks when the doorbell rings or there is noise in the stairwell, but she calms down after a couple minutes and has been trained so I can get her to sit and quiet almost immediately when I'm home. On the other hand, the baby I lived by would cry loud enough to be heard in my apartment and was often difficult to calm down. The young guys upstairs often play music loud enough to be heard in other apartments (even outside the building) and we had a lengthy struggle with our property manager to get their behavior under control. Why should dogs be singled out as being a noise issue?\n\nAnd yes, my dog's nails have made some scratches on the floor and in the paint. Children often play with toys that can and do cause the exact same damage. The stairwell in my current building is all scratched up from neighbors moving furniture (and the entryway light was broken during one move) and the guys upstairs constantly drop beer cans (by their own admission) and have weights they shift across the floor almost daily. Again: why single dogs out as problematic? And isn't this exactly what the security deposit is intended to cover?\n\nRegarding the yard, which I suppose is dog specific: I have a scoop and clean up after my dog every time. This is exactly the kind of information contained in the references from my previous landlords. If considered on a case by case basis, I see no reason this \"issue\" isn't avoidable.\n\nIn short: why is it okay to single dogs out as potential problems and usable as an excuse to refuse tenancy? I understand that the laws *allow* them to do so whereas they can't deny an application based on age or having children; I disagree with this as well. Either landlords can discriminate for *any* reason that may cause sound or damage, OR they must allow them all (including dogs). I hesitate to use a loaded word like \"discrimination\", but it's hard to resist, especially seeing as people who choose to have children are protected but those who choose to have pets are heavily restricted.\n\nFURTHERMORE, I believe changing their policy would actually benefit the landlords (especially early on). When so many apartments disallow pets, the ones they open their doors would have a wider pool of potential tenants. In many places (definitely in Boston), the rental market has numerous issues that need to be addressed and the landlords currently hold all the cards, so this benefit isn't immediately obvious. Still, I believe it would bear out in an overall more fair market.\n\nPS - I would understand some policies relating to location and breed, such as not allowing dogs over 100 pounds in an apartment with less than 500 square feet or something, but that would be for the dog's safety. Restrictions on breeds for being \"too violent\" seem very problematic and I believe should be examined on a case-by-case basis.\n\nTL;DR: Dogs are, on average, no worse than children or simply irresponsible/inconsiderate adults, so landlords should not be able to deny tenancy to pet owners.\n\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

That's not to discredit Tubman because what she did was brave and important, and her accomplishments weren't limited to the underground railroad, but I think it's fair to say that MLK had a greater impact than Tubman, and therefore is more deserving to be placed on the $20 bill.

{"input": "CMV: Ads on Hulu are no different from ads we've gotten on cable TV for decades, and people who complain about it are just spoiled. + \n + This is something that I just have such a hard time understanding.  For years we have been stuck with having cable or satellite subscriptions that are overly priced and force you to pay for large bundles of channels that you might not even want.  Streaming services like Hulu and Netflix have offered a great way to circumvent that process at a much more affordable price and are completely changing the way we view content.\n\nAnd yet I still see so many people getting so wound up over watching ads on Hulu.  My perception of their argument is this: \"I pay for Hulu, so I shouldn't have to see ads.\"  Maybe I'm over-simplifying it, but I just haven't seen any other viable argument that really says anything beyond that.\n\nNow, I should say I definitely understand hating ads.  I live in the city, and I can't walk ten feet out my door without someone trying to sell me something.  We are over-saturated by advertising and it's awful.  Thankfully with more options to block advertising on the internet, it's forcing advertisers to create ads that are more entertaining and feel less obtrusive (although, sometimes it does also force the opposite).\n\nBut even though I hate advertising as much as a lot of people do, I still recognize it as a vital part of what makes television work, and since I really like being able to know what happens on my favorite shows every week, I don't get my panties in a twist over it.\n\nI see a lot of people getting wound up who have little understanding of how a service like Hulu works.  I'm certainly not an expert either, but I have an understanding of how the licensing process works and how expensive it can be.  Netflix may be able to get by without ads, but Hulu offers something that Netflix doesn't: content from television that is current and has recently aired.\n\nNetflix usually won't provide new episodes of a show until an entire season is finished.  And even then, it might be a few months until even that happens.  The only current content they do have is their own original programming, which they can get away with because they own the licenses and don't have to pay any licensing fees or performance royalties to any outside production company.\n\nI've seen a lot of my favorite shows on Hulu have episodes be online just hours after it airs on live TV.  Since I dropped cable years ago, this is one of my favorite things about it.  I don't necessarily like that advertising is part of my subscription, but I also realize that Hulu has to license this content from production companies, who have had a history of being apprehensive when it comes to embracing changing technologies.  They are likely charging much higher licensing fees and royalties which means that Hulu in turns has to find other sources of income beyond subscription fees in order to make it work.  Not to mention that the networks themselves probably have their own fees since they probably have exclusivity deals with the production companies who make the programming.\n\nPeople are so quick to jump to the \"X company is a bunch of greedy corporate whores\" argument without understand the major complexities that go into making a service like Hulu work.  I'm sure Hulu is well aware that their subscribers don't like watching ads.  \"I don't like watching ads\" is even an option in their survey when you cancel your account.  People went on the same tirade when Netflix raised its prices, and I remember thinking the same thing then.\n\nI think that people's displeasure with advertising will ultimately shift services in the direction of removing advertising, but I still think that's a long way off.  Streaming services, despite being around for several years now, are still in their infancy in a lot of ways.  It's going to take a while to allow everyone to adapt and a lot of companies will be resistant to it in the hopes they can retain their old business models.  But I don't see any of this as the fault of Hulu for using advertising.\n\nSo my real curiosity here is to find an argument against Hulu's advertising that I haven't seen.  I see so many people upset about it, but I feel like my only understanding of their argument is that they're spoiled and don't want to see ads, which I recognize can be straw-manning on my part.  I'd like to see if someone can shift my bias and provide me some insight I'm not aware of.\n\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

Despite the Human Torch [never once being black in the comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_versions_of_the_Human_Torch), people said this was a good step forward in the superhero film community, and even that changing the typically white role to an black role would add levels of complexity to the story. On the other hand, critics called Stone's casting \"culturally insensitive,\" despite Cameron Crowe stating that the fact she's predominantly white, and has to constantly explain her \"unlikely heritage,\" was an actual aspect of her character, based on a real life redhead with 1/4 Chinese heritage.\n\nI don't mind casting people of color in typically white roles. I think it's good and it should be as inconsequential as POC involvement in other areas of life in the 21st century. In fact, in areas dominated by white characters, like the Marvel Universe, I'm completely open to the idea of adding more roles for POC. But when usually white roles are filled by POC, there's a lot of praise for reaching out and involving other races. Why not just focus on either creating films that feature black or other minority characters, like the [Black Panther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_(comics), or even start creating more original POC characters to reflect the changing racial landscape? Why is the casting itself of a mixed race character portrayed by a white actor \"insensitive?\"\n\nI'd love to hear other thoughts.

NO FRIDGE????\n\n\n[In California, a refrigerator is not a habitable condition. It's an amenity.] (http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/08/business/la-fi-rent-20120108)\nI found out via r/personalfinance that in Texas  - an air conditioning unit is a habitable condition - meaning the landlord must provide and repair it. In fact, when your A/C unit breaks (and its not tenants' fault), you might not owe rent for days its broken because the unit is only livable while the A/C is working per Texas law.  \n\n\nThere are several reasons state law should change to make a fridge a habitable condition. \n\n*  *I believe every other state requires this as a habitable condition, correct me if I'm wrong.* In my personal opinion an apartment without a fridge in not habitable, wouldn't you agree? but more importantly.... \n\n* *There's a lot of illegal bait-and-switch going on in the apartment rental market.* I'm shopping for an apartment now and I would say about half the listings that say \"fridge included\" are just outright lies. I caught a landlord in this lie just yesterday. He said \"oh well I must have made a mistake online...\" This also happens with dishwashers and with rent prices. You're not fooling any damn body, you listed imaginary apartment with fake pictures, just to get people to show up so you can start throwing sales shit at them.  Sometimes, in areas where the market is really hot (such as West Hollywood), people sign for apartments without having seen the inside first (because the unit is already leased by the time previous tenants move out). Making a fridge an optional amenity gives landlords the ability to LIE and say the unit comes with a fridge and then when they move in, they find out that the fridge belonged to the previous tenants. \nYou might say \"well they should read the lease before they sign\" but that logic only holds up in theory. In reality you know there are people getting screwed over on this issue. Such as people from other states who it never occurred to them that a fridge might not be included. \n\n* *California law should mimc Texas law* When a habitable condition appliance breaks, the landlord is losing rent money every day it sits broken. In Michigan, when a unit is unlivable, a tenant can break a lease with no penalty and no notice. That gives them very strong incentive to hurry up and fix it already. \nIf Texas does this with air conditioners, why cant California do this with a damn refrigerator? \n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

It is a guarantor of all other forms of rights, or it at least allows for the possibility of other rights.

No matter how humanely it happens, you are robbing the child of the years of life it could have had. having an abortion in my opinion is just as wrong because the 2 year old and the unborn child have almost the same likelihood to live out a full life and taking that away from either of them would be morally unjustifiable.\n\nAlso, the woman giving birth wouldn't have to take care of the child. contrary to popular belief, in recent years the number of children being put up for adoption has [steadily been decreasing,](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/15/us-adoption-domestic-waits-idUSBRE90E15Y20130115) while the time it takes for those who want to adopt a child has steadily been increasing, with some couples waiting up to seven years.\n\nAs a note my stance here has nothing to do with any sort of spiritual beliefs.

Here's my basic line of thought:\n\n* Stereotypes exist because the generalization is accurate.\n* Several of society's popular problems are blamed on other people acting with an awareness of stereotypes, or the stereotypes themselves.\n* A lot of cases regarding these problems are caused or made worse by the victim acting in accordance with a stereotype while blaming either the stereotype or something else.\n* If people made more of a conscious effort to not act in accordance with a stereotype in a situation where the stereotype could be considered relevant less incidents would occur.\n* When less incidents occur the stereotype changes or evaporates completely. \n\n'Victim' is somewhat of a loose term here (I'm excluding people who are indirectly involved with an incident pertaining to whatever social ill anyone might refer to) so before you shout \"victim blaming!\" I'll freely state that yes, I believe victims are *very rarely* 100% free from some kind of responsibility. \n\nAn example would be a black man being pulled over in a bad neighborhood and getting ticketed, arrested, or worse after arguing with/ resisting the police officer. We *might* be able to argue the man was unfairly profiled, but we can't prove something like that. It's much easier to take preventative measures (respect and compliance with the officer, no matter how shitty of a person they may be) and either avoid the situation completely or not make it harder than it needs to be. But once the black driver starts getting loud and upset, in the cops mind he's just another loud black person (fulfilling the stereotype) which could lead the officer to believe that the driver fulfills other aspects of his stereotype. \n\nAnother quick example would be the stereotype of men only being interested in sex and men saying \"not all men are pigs.\" Well, if that stereotype upsets you as a man, the only thing you can really do that will have any kind of effect is to not be a pig! But nobody seems to realize this, they just want everyone else to do what they ask. \n\nObviously I'm not proposing an over-night fix to any social issue, but what I'm proposing would benefit our society a lot more than victims telling everyone else to stop stereotyping. Pointing the finger at the aggressor(s) doesn't actually help solve the whole problem; all that does is either end that individual incident or piss people off. That shortsightedness does absolutely nothing to solve the problem on any kind of large, lasting scale. \n\nI'm happy to edit for any needed clarification. \nCMV!\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: Female Virginity is a big deal + \n + Hi, i am a 22 years old agnostic living in a conservative Muslim country that is considered a bit modern and open mind compared to other Muslim countries (Tunisia), i've said that so you know that my opinion is not based on religious rules, however it heavily depends on cultural traditions and moral codes that has been implemented into my way of thinking since i pop-up into this world (yeah that sounds a lot like a religion, it just doesn't include an invisible overpowered sky-man) \n\n\nAnyway, i'll try to keep this as short as possible and sum up my view toward this subject.\n\n\nIn our culture, a successful person is one who has a successful family, that include having a good job, good wife/husband a decent house and if you're good enough you'll have your own house and a car (yup, that's the dream of 90% of people here) so being raised with that goal in mind, anything that you do that could be considered a threat to that goal is considered **super bad** one of these many things is non-virgin girls, to be more precise, girls who lost their virginity in a non-marital relationship, these women are considered a no-no for marriage and the main two reasons here are religion and men's ego (i honestly believe that religion is made of men's ego so there is only one reason here...) anyway, so far i've been only talking about rules made by invisible people and what men wants, i completely ignored the women perspective here and the fact that this is their body, their choice and they can do whatever they want to, and am okay with that! i won't condemn a girl just because she slept with some guy and stone her to death, i won't even look down at her, but i can **never** imagine myself marrying her, why? because i cannot stand the fact that someday, someone, could look at me and say: \n\nThat's not cool bro, it's very embarrassing, and yup, the counter-argument for this would be : \n\n\n\nwell, i don't want anybody to fuck my partner o_O !! even in the past when we didn't even knew each other, that's my view on this. \n\n\nAlso, another argument that i would like to hear your opinion about is that i don't want to live in a society where kids are having sex, no offense but, [16 and pregnant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_and_Pregnant) has 5 seasons! and i read all the time about 12,13,14,15 years old kids having sex, and i believe the reason this is happening is due to this \"openness\" that western countries have about sex and that's why this kind of things is very rare in a conservative society, this is the only positive point that i can come up with regarding my view on the subject, the rest is like i said, a pure ego of a selfish men dominant society, but if it protect our kids, i think it's worth it, it's also the reason of a an ultimate boring amateur sex life which is the main reason of cheating and divorce but that's an after-marriage subject lol.\n\n\nSo, western men (or anyone who is okay with non-virgin wives) how can you change my view on this ? \n\n\n\nIt seems that i missed a point that come up to many of you here : \n\nYes, ideally a man should stay virgin too, and from a religious perspective he'll had the same punishment as the women which is 100 lash, no idea where the stoning come from but again ignore the religion crap and no none of this happen in my country/culture, however, due to other facts like men are more likely the ones who had the job and the money, and that men are the one who have the option to \"look out\" for their future wives, this will make women more vulnerable to this virginity rules, since they are the one who wait and just decide to say yes or no, while men have the \"option\" to choose, which make the pre-marriage sex \"sin\" for men a lot less important compared to women, and of course you cannot ignore the \"physical evidence\", since we are far from living in an ideal world, a man could have sex as much as he want and just lie about it, while a woman cannot do that (well she can but most of the time they cannot)      \n\n\n\nSorry but i missed another points : \n\nWell, i think it's all related to that \"life goal\", if a girl (or man) take the risk of threatening that goal by having sex then they are simply considered bad people, and no one would like to marry a bad person (i have no idea about forgiveness option though).\n\n\n\nI personally have zero problem with that, but i think it's also a no-no thing in this culture.  \n\n\nThanks\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

For example, if a man suggests that a certain job would be done better by a man (which is IMO entirely possible for some positions) that would be seen as sexist an/or oppressive towards women.

{"input": "CMV: Everyone else should just let White Males have reddit + \n + With all that is going on with Reddit lately I think the big thing that is being ignored is that this is largely a White male community. When it functioned in that way everything seemed to go more or less fine (of course there were others interspersed but that was the majority of viewpoints). As more and more groups began to be introduced there were shall we say competing interests. They correctly are asking for space within the community as well. However, the problem is White men had already kind of adopted this space as a place where they could discuss their problems without feeling guilty etc. For example, when people complain about false rape charges getting to the front page constantly or reverse discrimination cases etc etc. I think the SJW this and that we often see is just pushback from White Men feeling \"invaded\" for lack of a better word.

{"input": "CMV: Hunting is an antiquated sport that should be banned. + \n + First, what I refer to as \"hunting\" is the killing or trapping of any animal, with the purpose of doing so, as sport, whether it be to eat them as food or keep them as trophies. I am not talking about the regulated hunting of threatening species or the killing of animals in situations where they pose significant danger.\n\nRecently, we've seen the story of Cecil the lion become big news across the country and in the world at large. The fact that we as humans hold dominion over all other earthly creatures necessitates the notion of a responsibility we have in keeping balance and order to the food chain, considering that humans are the top of it. \n\nKilling for sport is something--one could argue--not inherent only in humans, but we've taken it beyond what it means if an animal were to kill another animal for sport just by sheer organization. I'm speaking of our current gaming rules and regulations in place, meant to keep this balance--one would want to believe--but a system well beyond anything an animal killing another animal for sport could come up with, for obvious reasons. And, as the story of Cecil the lion illustrates, the system governing wildlife from being hunted and killed is flawed, to say the least.\n\nIn regards to the act of hunting, and then using prey as food, I would argue that in our modern society, this is completely unnecesary, given the obvious institutions in place all ready, i.e., the supermarket. \n\nThe bottom line may be that hunting exists because we as humans enjoy it, it is thrilling to us, but should that condone its existence? We condemn the murder of humans. Why view other animals any different in that regard?\n\nAdmittedly, the quandary I have with my argument is that I feel it should be banned all over the world. However, due to the problems and beliefs of other societies around the world, some of which being so underdeveloped that hunting game is a valuable source of income, I have to limit my banning to the United States alone. By doing this, I'm brought back to the senseless killing of Cecil the lion, which was done in a different country. I argue, though, that it was carried out by an American, one who believed in the sport of hunting, who willingly paid tens of thousands of dollars to do it, and that, had he come from a society that looked down on the sport, he might not have had such determination to carry out what he did.\n\nLastly, I say it is *antiquated*, but that is a reflection of my opinion based on the notion that hunting was a means of surviving which is no longer necessary in our current society. This definition recognizes that at one point, there was a reason at some point in history for its existence, however. \n\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

Quite the contrary, it seems more fair and sustainable than free market purism. + \n + Obviously the Soviet Union did horrible things and killed millions of people over the decades (but so did America, countries in western Europe, Japan, Germany and other capitalist countries) and Red China did and continues to do horrible things, but this was more as a result of being overly punitive and stubbornly autarkic than any fault of socialism itself. While I do think the farms were collectivized way too fast, for the most part the crimes the communist states committed had more to do with their authoritarian and ideological rigidity than with people starving because they \"ran out of other people's money\" as conservatives like to quip.\n\nThere's nothing inherent about socialism that means you have to kill off your opponents or commit genocide, or censor the media and throw dissidents in prison. This is a result of the largest communist states being one-party ruled, and an overly vengeful culture and government. Capitalist dictatorships of the 20th century like Pinochet's Chile and Suharto's Indonesia were the exact same way in this regard. \n\nOne can have both communism and democracy - Mongolia, Nepal and Albania all democratically elected communist parties in the 90s. I just don't see anything wrong with distributing the wealth, especially when you consider the positive track record of such attempts in mixed economics like the Nordic countries, Australia and Canada. \n\nI'd even argue that for all of the bad things Soviet Russia and Red China did, they were still much better than the monarchies that came beforehand. They also did see a lot of economic growth and development. Before the Communists Russia and China were backwaters, practically medieval societies. By the 80s they were very well developed and the majority of the population lived relatively modern lifestyles with radios, electricity, healthcare (not necessarily the best, but given non-discriminately and vastly better than what was available in the 19th century), television sets (even if they were mostly B&amp;W), universal education and running water. It's hard to deny that communism was a success in the sense of material prosperity growing.\n\nSo I fail to see why communism is inferior to capitalism, aside from the fact that nationalist movements ultimately destroyed the Soviet Union. You could also argue that Japan and America's unending economic stagnation represents a failure of capitalism, and it would make just as much sense.\n\nI think the best system is one that mixes capitalism and communism together - that allows innovation and makes it easy for people to start enterprises, but also has a strong publicly owned \"backbone\" and distributes wealth so that the poor do not starve or end up homeless, and the rich and middle class live in a more stable and safe society, which is the case when you have fewer people who are desperate and irrational due to poverty.\n\n\n\n\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

I've watched my sibling get into pot, get depressed, attempt suicide, and have anxiety attacks. This all started once they began smoking. I have dead friends, \"burn-out\" friends and friends who smoke 420 blaziken MLG pro Monster blunts daily with minor anxiety and side-effects. My point is that while pot doesn't directly give people depression or anxiety etc. that don't already have a propensity for it, that it does help bring those (forgive my lack of better phrasing) \"disorders\" to the surface. \n\nWays to convince me: Reputable studies showing people who smoke are less likely to be depressed, anxious, suicidal. A fair-logical argument will likely win me over, since all my examples are generally first-hand.\n\n\nStuff that won't work- any argument saying \"you're only one person, this is a rare extreme\" \"have you ever smoked it?\" or \"Everything you said is objective etc. etc.\" I'm not saying that those pursuits are incorrect, just that it's not going to convince me.\n\n\nThank you, and happy CMV'ing\n\n\nGeneral Links:\n\n\n[Schizophrenia](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/270262.php)\n\n[Depression](http://learnaboutmarijuanawa.org/factsheets/mentalhealth.htm) \n\n[Anxiety](http://www.leafscience.com/2014/03/07/study-explains-marijuana-makes-paranoid/)\n\n[Spooky side-effects](http://www.drugfreeworld.org/drugfacts/marijuana/short-and-long-term-effects.htm)\n\n[WebMD](http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-947-marijuana.aspx?activeingredientid=947&amp;activeingredientname=marijuana)\n\n\n\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump gain popularity from the same underlying reasons + \n + This is how it appears to me as a non-American. In effect, people are moving to support these two candidates mostly in response to the same set of events:\n\n- Disillusionment with the political establishment. Voters are fed up with the highly polished and spin doctored politicians, with overtly similar views, that make up the rest of the leadership candidates. Moreover they feel the insularity of groups within political circles leads to a strong divergence from doing what is best for the people to doing what is best for the elite. In response they support people with seemingly strongly felt policy proposals, messages, and who have only - if at all, existed at the forefront of mainstream politics.\n\n- A response to the emergence of political dynasties. Hillary and Jeb both feel like rehashes of past presidents, and voters fear an arrogance and weakening of democracy if familial dominance is extended.\n\n- Anger at cronyism and corruption. Support for people percieved to fall less into donor's pockets. Sanders stands against this kind of \"selling out\" and Trump would seem to be rich enough to fund himself. (Reality isn't important here, only what people think).\n\n- Upset at being left behind financially. Sanders talks about raising the minimum wage, organising co-ops and unions and making trade deals beneficial to the American people. Trump talks about forcing companies to situate factories in the USA, especially in cities on steep decline like Detroit. Voter feel these two\n\n- Upset at the pace of change. (This goes in alternate directions so may be less suitable). The USA is deeply split in its range of ideologies, Obama felt it prudent to oppose Gay marriage officially when he first ran for President due to this in order to gain enough votes. With Trump, to quite Iain Dey in the London Times \"Large numbers of Americans are struggling to get their opinions up to speed with the liberal agenda and they are fed up with being ignored...[which] is why a candidate currently percieved to be a joke is leading the race for the Republican presidential nomination\" . Conversely others feel that Sanders would push their nation towards a more tolerant and open nation, and more supportive of minorities and the less well off.\n\nSo please, change this l'il Limey's view that these two candidates gain support for offering their (differing) responses to many of the same problems.\n\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

(I'm not here to argue whether or not it was, as the investigation is still ongoing and many developments have yet to come, but for the purpose of this discussion I'm going to assume it was.)  \n\nMuch like with the Elliot Rodgers case, there are many people already stating that this is purely a mental health issue and it's just the liberal media drumming up a race war and etc.  \n\nI don't think it's fair to detract from those arguments, as there are many many people with mental illnesses living non-violently. Even if people with certain mental illnesses have a higher chance of committing violence, and even if most mass murderers do have some kind of mental illness, it shouldn't detract from the fact that there are social motivators that led them ultimately to taking others' lives. The reason I say it's \"disingenuous\" to downplay them is because it allows people who believe there's nothing wrong (eg. that racism is still a major problem) to persuade others that there's nothing wrong, even though there's evidence in the form of the killings that there's still a problem. \n\nIn this case, it was the suspect's surrounding himself with racist rhetoric that led him so far down a path of hatred towards black people that he acted violently against them. In Elliot Rodger's case, it was his intense hatred of women not sleeping with him (and resentment of other men he saw as his 'competitors') that ultimately led him to go on his spree.  \n\nI believe that bigoted hatred should also be addressed alongside mental illness, and shouldn't be downplayed by the media or the public whenever these issues arise.

{"input": "CMV: Nuclear war in the near future is inevitable until virtually all such weapons are eliminated. + \n + By near future, I mean 0 to 100 years. Given the irrationality of humanity, and the long history of systemic failures leading to the unthinkable, the presence of nuclear weapons represents an existential risk that is all too plausible.\n\nThe total yield of all nuclear weapons is measured in the *gigatons*. Though work has been done in the area of disarmament, the pace is far too slow to be meaningful. Even the presence of 20 modern nuclear weapons is an intolerable threat. \n\nBut a nuclear war involving only 20 weapons is a pipe dream. There are thousands of 'active' nuclear weapons, ready to be deployed, and at the current pace of disarmament, any nuclear war within the next 100 years will involve *at least* hundreds of weapons, with a total explosive yield in the hundreds of megatons.\n\nEven one is too many. If, for example, terrorists detonated a nuclear weapon of moderate yield in Manhattan, simulations have shown a total fatality amount of nearly a million. Economic damage due to both direct and indirect effects would likely be in the trillions. Geopolitics would be utterly and irreversibly destabilized for the foreseeable future. North Korea and Iran would suddenly appear to require immediate military intervention to forestall future attacks, and the American public would gladly endorse it.\n\nThis even would represent one of the greatest calamities in human history. Yet the threat of this pales when compared with a nuclear war involving multiple nations. In a full-scale nuclear war, immediate causalities would be in the hundreds of millions, potentially rising to billions depending on the extent of the war and the resulting collapse of infrastructure and climate stability. The very concept of a global economy would cease to exist. Humanity would be plunged into internecine conflict for decades, possibly centuries, as those still alive fought tooth and claw over the rubble of civilization. Suffice to say, short of an asteroid impact on the scale of Chicxulub, it is hard to imagine a worse fate for mankind.\n\nNow, let me address the problem of mutually assured destruction. This subject really requires its own topic, but I'll try to be as concise as I can. All major nuclear arsenals are organized around this idea, and so they are kept ready at all times, waiting for the call. This is insanely dangerous, as it means any mistake or false positive will not simply cause some weapons to be launched in retaliation, but *all* weapons. Implicit in the idea of MAD is that any nuclear strike must be responded to with overwhelming force, and the response must happen **immediately**, long before the bombs start going off.  A submarine-launched ballistic missile would take less than 15 minutes to reach a major city - that is the window our leaders have to judge if an attack is real or imaginary. Mistakes and false positives of this kind [have already happened](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov), and will surely happen in the future. We only need be unlucky once. \n\nIf that weren't bad enough, we have the growing danger of missile defense initiatives, which although perhaps well-intentioned, serve to destabilize the already questionable state of nuclear deterrence. What happens when, for one country, MAD is no longer mutual? If you believe your only true means of defense is being taken from you, what response do you have left?\n\nBut here is what is really scary, what should truly frighten you: it doesn't frighten you at all. This is the great paradox of nuclear war. It is simply too big to fathom. Just like attempting to imagine the scale of the universe, our minds fail us. Because we cannot imagine it, we dismiss it as a kind of fantasy. I am guilty of this too. Here I am, writing this post with all sincerity, and yet to contemplate it doesn't disturb me one bit. Of course it won't happen, right?\n\nI feel that this is the true peril we are facing. While our leaders may understand the threat intellectually, they have no visceral reaction to it. Not the reaction required to affect the needed changes to remove the threat. As history teaches us, world leaders are perpetually blindsided by what seems so obvious in hindsight.\n\nWe saw this with WWI: who would have thought one assassination would lead to a war killing millions? We saw this with 9/11: who would have thought it was so trivial to use commercial jets as weapons? We saw this with credit default swaps: who would have thought how easily they would cause systemic collapse of the economy? Who would have thought...\n\nThis where we are right now. The weapons are here, they are ready. The trigger need only the lightest pressure.

To the contrary, it says that women are more likely to be protected by society than men, and are given special \"female privileges\" which makes their development easier.\n\n2. In the USA all male citizens MUST register with the Selective Service when they turn 18 so they can be drafted into war if \"needed\" and possibly die. This is a highly sexist law at its core. What would happen if we had a law that only drafted African-Americans, or Latinos, or people with blue eyes? Why don't we draft women? Should we? Some nations like Israel do.\n\n3. If a woman and a man engage in sexual intercourse and pregnancy results, a woman can make decisions that disregards the man\u2019s input but that affect him drastically. If the woman decides to terminate the pregnancy, the man has no legal say in the matter. And if the woman decides to continue the pregnancy, again without any discretion from the man, he is legally responsible for child support for 18 years. If he fails to support such a child he can have his wages garnished and/or be imprisoned. (Please note I AM NOT CLAIMING that a man SHOULD have a legal right here, just that he has no legal standing - it is entirely a woman's choice about how to deal with the pregnancy, and this gives her more control and power than a man in that circumstance) For example, a woman can have the baby and then give up a child for adoption against the man's wishes - http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/12/31/22124881-dad-files-130m-lawsuit-after-son-in-utah-is-given-up-for-adoption.

Can you convince me it merely reflects the fact that every person has pretty much every trait in them in some form, so if someone says \"I hate X\" they're bound to have some of X in their personality.\n\nAn important distinction: I'm talking about \"hate\" that people regularly bring up, like a person who's known for having a hate or dislike of something in particular (something non-trivial, not broccoli or crap movies): **Things that people hate which they think about regularly.**\n\nWhen people say they hate homosexuals, odds are pretty high they have closeted homosexual desires.

{"input": "CMV: Only registered members of a political party should be permitted to seek and obtain that party's nomination for elected office. + \n + The 2016 US presidential primary race is well underway, and the large pool of candidates in both major political parties is exposing a significant gap in the nominating process. Some of the leading candidates are of questionable party affiliation (e.g. Donald  Trump is now a registered Republican but has faced criticism for switching parties throughout his lifetime; Lincoln Chafee was a Republican while serving as a Mayor, Senator, and Governor, and only became a Democrat in 2013) or are unabashedly independent of any party affiliation (Bernie Sanders is not a registered Democrat but still running for the Democratic nomination).  \n\nThis has led to a lot of controversy on both sides about throwing the weight of the party behind someone whose allegiance to the party is questionable, and with good reason. For the following reasons, I believe that by law only registered members of a political party should be able to seek and obtain that party's nomination for elected office. \n\n1) Parties spend a substantial amount of resources to try to elect their nominees. These resources often come from contributions (in terms of money, activism, work hours etc) governed by election law made by party members or supporters to support fellow party members. It is inappropriate to allocate these resources to someone who, despite achieving the nomination, is not even a member of the party in the first place.\n\n2) Many third parties with access to general election ballots often nominate the same person, which causes that individual to appear on the ballot several times for the same position. This duplication is unfair to candidates from other parties (especially third parties) who may only appear on the ballot once. For the purposes of the official ballot, parties should only be allowed to formally nominate their own members, or no one at all. \n\n3) The members of a political party's presidential ticket are the de facto leaders of their national party during and (if elected) after the election. The same principle applies for nominees for Governor at the state-level, Mayor at the municipality-level, etc. Nominees' political positions are often absorbed into the general party platform, which can impact elections and party voter turnout elsewhere. It is nonsensical, and unfair to party members, for their de facto leaders to be from another party or no party at all, especially given that nominations are mostly a function of popular vote. (Tangentially, I am also opposed to \"open primaries\" where voters who aren't registered members of a political party can still vote in that party's primary election, but I suppose that's a topic for another CMV post. And of course, it should continue to be against election rules to be a registered member of more than one political party.)\n\n4) There is nothing wrong with or prohibitive about running for office as an independent. Ross Perot staged a pretty successful third party run for president in 1992. Sanders is the longest serving independent in the Senate. Many other people have been elected to political office at various levels of government without obtaining a major party nomination. Our political system does not preclude independents from winning elections, so any argument that an independent's only real chance of winning is to seek the nomination of a party with which (s)he does not formally affiliate is historically and demonstrably invalid. \n\nCMV.\n\n\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

The purpose of this 'tap out' option - and the suggested break time above may not be the best system, but it's just off the top of my head - would be to allow students suffering from a brain freeze, panic attack, stress moment etc. to take a breather. From personal experience many students experience these terrifying ARGHHHHH HELP moments during exams, and I feel that in many cases, a short break and an opportunity to stand up for awhile would really clear the mind. \n\nPossible objections include: \n\n- Ease of cheating. Yes, but an extra invigilator could follow the student out or simply have someone standing in the hallway. \n\n- It's not fair, disruptive, etc. Yes, but ideally the student would be able to raise his/her hand (just like if you had a crazy stomachache) and be escorted quietly out. Also, not too many students would take advantage of this system IMO. \n\n- Extra thinking time: I don't believe that the 5 min 'tap out' should be counted in the exam writing time as this would discourage anxious/stressing students from making use of this option. I also think that it would cause more stress to students who would already be freaking out about not finishing the paper. In my opinion, 5 minutes extra for an exam should not be causing so much difference in terms of performance; if students are working to the last minute, the time limit is 1) too tight or 2) they simply don't know the material. \n\nI would really welcome thoughts on why this is not a practice and suggestions as to why this current suggestion is not a good idea/is a good idea.\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: Sex in public should be legal. + \n + Specifically, people should not be *legally* punished for enjoying themselves through sexual activity in a public place (governmentally operated), like a park or a beach. This activity should be treated by the state as any other public activity, like having a family picnic, a pickup basketball game, or tanning in the sun, and be liable to the same restrictions. That is, sex on a public highway would be unreasonable just as having a picnic on a highway would. Again, in the same grain, this applies to purely public land, not private areas, like businesses (unless they allow such activities). Finally, this is in the context of the United States, but could probably be extended to other countries.\n\nThere are a number of reasons which some might oppose this, so lets preemptively address some of them:\n\n* **Sex is a safety hazard to others.** This is one of the more legitimate points. Full public nudity is opposed for the same reasons; people could reasonably not want to sit in the buttsweat of someone on a bus. However, this would apply to beaches and parks, where clothing is already very optional and the environment is assumed to be unclean (as opposed to a semi-sanitary bus seat). Furthermore, similarly risky activities are allowed in public places, like pickup football, or parties where litter affects others.\n* **People don't want to see it.** Public spaces are generally viewed as areas where freedom should abound- restrictions on speech and assembly are looked down on. For instance, an 'unattractive' person is not *legally* disallowed from a beach, even though some might not want to see that person.\n* **It promotes STDs.** Telling people that they can't have sex is an infringement on personal freedoms, and as long as the sex does no harm to others, that basic human desire should not be impeded.\n* **Casual sex is morally wrong.** If casual sex is morally wrong from a religious perspective, then seperation of church and state should apply to public recreation areas. If sex is morally wrong from a secular view (like theft), then I would need to see a convincing argument that justifies this stance.\n* **Children should not see sex.** Sex is a activity innate to humans and animals alike, and as such should be considered a part of life that everyone should be exposed to. Certainly, children should be guided to mitigate risks (physical and emotional) involved with sex, which we currently do with sex education, but sex itself should not be seen as something harmful to a child.\n\nI'm open to criticism about any of these points, but for now sex seems like it should be legally treated as any other activity in a public area. CMV.\n\n\n\nI've heard a lot of interesting points today, which is great for a Fresh Topic Friday! Unfortunately, none have been strong enough so far to change my view.

In that unit, we were taught the very bare details of the war: The south seceded when they couldn't keep their slaves, and declared war on the north in doing so, Lincoln was a great guy who freed all the slaves with the emancipation proclamation, and then the north won.\n\nIn 8th grade I was taught more details to the story. The south seceded because the right of the states to decide on whether they keep slaves was being questioned, as well as there being the beginning of unequal representation of slave-nonslave states. The south secedes, war begins. I was taught this more comprehensive view in more detail in my junior year of High School, with emphasis on the economic and cultural dichotomy of the north and south: The north was a manufacturing powerhouse that didn't need slaves, and the South was largely agricultural and couldn't afford to *not* use slaves.\n\nI, as a student, preferred being taught the States' rights version of the civil war, as it shows that the South was not comprised of nothing but slave-owning bigots, but that both sides were trying to preserve their way of life.

I underwent SRS (sex reassignment surgery) seven years ago, but I do not feel that medical science is advanced enough to cure my dysphoria to an acceptable extent - my physical appearance is just far too different from my inner self image.\n\nFor this reason, I have been unable to enjoy any aspect of my life. I have had numerous relationships, some short term, a couple of long term, but they have all felt \"forced\" - not at all natural and how I'd expect a relationship to be. As I never felt like myself, I could never really participate in the relationships in the way I'd like to - and more or less all of them ended for these reasons. To elaborate, I felt no real emotions - I told myself I was feeling them, because that's what I expected, but none of it was ever \"real\".\n\nThe rest of my life has followed similar patterns. It's as if I am looking at someone else's life through a window, never actually experiencing the feelings and emotions that I'd expect to feel. I am unable to experience most emotions - the only thing I feel is disappointment and frustration about my situation. Other than that, I just feel numb.

I have taken up hobbies, sought medical treatment for the dysphoria as well as counselling, various anti-depressants and SSRIs, etc. (despite the fact that I do not suffer from depression) all to no avail.

It seems like every news article I read gives me further disdain for the human race, for the world around me.\n\nThe simple fact is, I have absolutely no desire to be here.

{"input": "CMV: Math should not segregate students of different skill levels by placing an adept student into the next year's class. Instead, advanced students should be placed in a rigorous class that uses the same concepts in their peers but in more unconventional and challenging ways. + \n + Disclaimer: I am only well versed with the math system in the USA.\n\nIn the contemporary classroom, math is an integral class to any student's curriculum. Students are all required to take math for nearly every year. The teacher usually teaches just the concepts in these normal classes. Some students score much higher on these conceptual tests administrated to the class than others. When this consistently happens, the school opts to place the student in a so-called advanced math class, in which they learn material in advance and at a faster pace than their peers. For example, those who demonstrate exceptional ability in 6th grade can skip to Algebra 1 if they pass a ~~national~~ standardized placement test. Supposedly, the schools have demonstrated that they have accomodated the student's needs for a more rigorous class. However, I believe that they have instead wasted the potential of the student's ability because the student never is allowed to expand and extrapolate from the concepts they are taught.\n\nWhen we examine the student who skips to Calculus in year 10 when their peers are learning Geometry, we can see that both the advanced student and the regular students are learning math at the same depth. The Calculus student is supposedly more advanced simply because they have learned more content. However, when we consider that the advanced student has taken summer classes which claim to teach a year's worth of math in 8 weeks, one must then question how the adept has demonstrated their true mastery of the material. Most classes in the USA are little more than plug and chug classes. Algebra 1 teaches students how to make linear and quadratic functions, but it doesn't teach the context behind why they're used. Geometry, which supposedly emphasizes proofs and thinking beyond plug and chug, presents its questions in a straightforward manner. The diagrams are simple enough to \"eyeball\" the answer before one even starts the proof. Algebra 2 is a mashup of so many random concepts, like exponentials and logarithms, polynomials, sequences and series, and matrices, but it doesn't teach amything about why we have those functions and why we use those functions. We don't learn in Algebra 2 that logs were used to represent numbers of greater magnitude than what is comprehendable, nor are we taught about the ability for sequences and series to approximate a value. Trigonometry only teaches us how we can graph a sinusoid and how to use the Law of Sines. It doesn't teach us how we can use sinusoids to represent harmonic motion, nor does it teach how people rearranged the Pythagorean theorem to create a more convenient rule for different scenarios. The school only teaches surface level content to its students, creating a math foundation which is a mile wide, but only a millimeter deep.\n\nEven in differential calculus, students are usually only taught a.) what the derivative is, b.) how to differentiate this long equation, and c.) how to maximize/minimize the function. They aren't taught the true potential and the true challenge of using calculus, and why people created calculus in the first place. For example, while most may know how to maximize the volume of a box, they most likely won't know how to find mutual tangent lines of two quadratic equations. The second task requires understanding of not only what the derivative is, but also requires one to know how to combine the concepts of two points on a linear equation and the how having two different parabolas will affect the model/setup used. What is the point of learning faster if a.) the slower peers will reach the same amount of understanding as you and b.) you will run out of so-called harder and more advanced classes?\n\nSome schools claim that their honors classes solve this problem entirely. They claim that with their honors class comes a chance to view material in \"greater depth\". From my observations (feel free to post counterexamples), I see the schools just jamming more surface level content into their classes. Algebra 2 Honors simply adds conics and asks the students to transform the rectangular equations. They are never taught about how conics begin with parametrics and then transform into rectangular equations. Precalculus Honors simply covers limits (and in some places, simple derivatives) without really expanding on said concepts. What I don't understand is why these schools don't spend more time on developing mastery and context to each concept.\n\nMath, after all, is about understanding patterns of numbers. It's not about simply plug and chug. We don't do harder math by saying \"99x99 is easier than 999x999, which is easier than 9999x9999, therefore we should teach the advanced to do 9999x9999\", we ask ourselves why the answers of those multiplications creates a pattern of 9801, 998001, and 99980001. It's a shame that this kind of teaching is what's driving some people away from math. To them, it's simply busywork, because no teacher provides a challenge which requires much forethought to answer.\n\nCMV?\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: The US congressional system is far more representative than the Westminster parliamentary system + \n + Something I've noticed is that there is a prevailing opinion that the Westminster parliamentary system (i.e. the one used in Australia, Canada, and the UK) is far more representative of the populace than the US congressional system. This usually stems from the observation that there are generally more political parties at play under Westminster parliamentary systems than is the case under the US's congressional system.\n\nBut this argument seems to break down when more closely examined. In particular, my biggest problem with it is that parties in a Westminster system are very different from those in a congressional system.\n\nSpecifically, parties in a Westminster system are far, *far* more homogenous and rigid than those in a congressional system. From what I've seen, under the former it is rare to the extreme to vote against your party while in the latter it is notable when a vote is split perfectly along party lines. To give an example, the \"Blue Dog Democrats\" are a subgroup of the Democratic party that often \"crosses the aisle\" to vote with the Republican party. As far as I can tell, that sort of behavior would be likely to get one kicked out of one's party in a Westminster system.\n\nIn other words, party discipline is much stronger in a Westminster system than a congressional system.\n\nThe strangest thing to me is that this homogeneity kind of appears to defeat the point of having parties in the first place - if the point is that the parties are voted into power and do not split their votes, then why bother to have many different MPs? Surely it would achieve the same effect if each party was just given a block of votes equal to the number of seats they would hold, no?\n\nThis all seems rather obvious to me, which tells me that I am most likely missing something significant or perhaps misunderstanding some key feature of the Westminster political system.\n\nFor the record, I am from the US and therefore far more familiar with the congressional system than Westminster systems, though I do try to understand both as best I can.\n\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: Much modern and contemporary art (i.e. non-figurative, \"ready-made\", conceptual etc.) is of profound and deeply expressive merit + \n + Thought I would flip the usual \"Modern art isn't real art\" stance around and present a muscular defense of the various 'radical' branches of 20th and 21st century art. Come at me with all you've got about the poverty of modern art! I'm going to start with a rebuttal of some of the common points raised against the worth of modern art, and then list some of the artists I like and why I like them.\n\n\nSo here's what I see as the commonly raised objections to the value of modern and contemporary art (the distinction between these two terms is somewhat ambiguous, but basically modern art is most of what was created from 1900-1960s, and then a shift to 'contemporary' art gradually occurred). \n\n\n* No effort/technical skill is required to create it\n\n* \"I don't get it/it's just colors\"\n\n* It's not pretty/beautiful\n\nPlease let me know of any others you can think of! But, to address these I've listed:\n\n\nFirst: No effort is required to create it. Yes, in many cases very little traditional technical skill is necessary to create any number of famous pieces of the last century. And by the same token, often very little quantifiable time or physical effort would have been necessary to create the same pieces. But why do we want art to require technical skill or effort? The answer seems to me that it makes worth quantifiable in terms of man-hours spent or technical skills applied - we assign worth to goods with money, and we earn certain amounts of money based on the time we work at a particular job. That feels simple - but actually we know when we think about it that even the apparently firm valuation possible with money is linked to arbitrary process - the economic status of the country which issues it, political contingencies and emergencies, the variability of market prices for goods and services, etc. And time itself is subject to the same instability - it zips by when we're having fun, and drags endlessly when we're working on a tedious task. Similar insights to these are driving factors in the way the artwork of the 20th century moved gradually away from traditional technical representation of subject matter. When we acknowledge that all processes of valuation are, at bottom, arbitrary, we are liberated from the requirement to adhere to traditional systems of valuation, but also forced to confront the problem of using any system of valuation at all. If all value is arbitrary, can we value anything? Is creation valuable? Life itself?\n\n\nThis brings us the 2nd objection: \"It's just colors/abstract\". A common whipping-boy for Reddit's typical reaction against modern art is Mark Rothko, whose monumental color blocks are often presented as a sort of \"Emperor's New Clothes\". And of course, while there actually is a great deal of technical canvas and paint ability which goes into Rothko's works, traditional figurative techniques are abandoned in them. But we must take note: the 'effort' Rothko is putting into his work is not technical effort but rather effort towards discovering a system of valuation which he can stand on and for after he has abandoned traditional systems. For Rothko, his paintings represented man's transcendental relationship with his own consciousness, a kind of pure, experiential expression of pure Being. It is noteworthy that the dominant philosophical trends of the time were phenomenology and existentialism, which were attempts to find a fundamental ground for consciousness in a newly modern world whose science had demoted God from his throne but neglected to nominate a new Fundamental Arbiter in replacement. So, while Rothko does not use traditional figurative techniques, his work is effortful in the sense that it tries to express a new sense of modern spirituality without God. Variations of the same can be said for much of the various avant-gardes of the first half of the 20th century; traditional artistic valuation was being abandoned (and concrete and universal measurement along with it), but the search for a new ground from and of which to create art was a consuming occupation.\n\n\nAnd finally, number 3, \"It's not beautiful/it's ugly\": This point obviously is answered to some degree by the points I've previously made - in dismissing traditional techniques, traditional standards are also held up to question. Beauty becomes something that is not necessarily inherent in a particular nude figure painted with particular colors and brush-strokes, if it is even something to be strived after at all. Duchamp's 'Fountain', among much of his other work, was a fairly direct critique of traditional concepts of artistic beauty, and later Conceptual artists would work with ideas which were in many cases almost totally devoid of physical manifestation, or any object with which to invest with traditional beauty. That doesn't mean many of their works are not beautiful however - the simplicity and poetic elegance of Hans Haacke's [Condensation Cube](http://www.macba.cat/en/condensation-cube-1523) would, I argue, meet many updated standards of beauty; a simple transparent figure which manifests changes in the heat and pressure of the room it is within it, providing a sort of spiritual residue of the minds and bodies which perceive and surround it. In any case, the gist of my rebuttal to this last point is that just as artistic techniques had to shift fundamentally to address our experience of living in the modern age, so did standards of beauty, and even the valuation of beauty itself.\n\n\nSo those are my initial defenses against some of the more common critiques of modern art - please do your best to pick them apart, as well as point out other points that I've missed. Take your best shot! But now that I've put up a defense, I'm going to launch a little offense - examples of some of my favorite artists of the last century, all having worked at some points at least in very untraditional mediums. Perhaps some of you will appreciate these artists as much as I do - and perhaps others of you will gain new fodder for the pointed attacks against my favorable stance towards modern art that I am hoping for!\n\n\nI love [Marcel Duchamp] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Duchamp_Fountaine.jpg). I love [Dieter Roth](http://blog.art21.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/moma_roth_literaturesausage.jpg). I love [Martin Kippenberger](http://www.markorton.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/kippenburger-moma-032809.jpg). I love [Bruce Nauman](http://inhalemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bruce-nauman2.jpg). All of these artists have in common their use of non-representational artistic techniques. Duchamp introduced the 'ready-made', and irreverently demonstrated the contingency of artistic value through his 'Fountain'. Roth frequently incorporated real food into his work, which inevitably would decompose and change form (and smell). His use of this material points towards the mortality and changeability of things, as well as linking the traditionally abstract realm of artistic production to the corporeality of bodily functioning. One of Martin Kippenberger's most famous pieces is his 'Happy End of Franz Kafka's America', which assembled dozens of pairs of chairs around desks on a sports playing field, with books commissioned by friends of the artists on many of the desks. The work is almost all 'ready-mades', so to speak, with most of the furniture being found and the books written by someone other than the artist, but that's exactly the point - Kippenberger's conception of the creativity of the artist rejected the traditional image of the solitary genius plucking ideas from the ether. Rather, art for Kippenberger was an inherently social function, a variable form of communication of the same type as talking or writing - although a communicative form of imperative spiritual importance. Kippenberger repositioned the artist within the social milieu from which he is at bottom inseparable. Nauman is a mercurial figure who works in many mediums - from sculptures that look like rags tossed in a corner to blinking poetic invocations in neon. What they have in common is an ambiguously anti-monumental sense; if art can be anything, as Duchamp demonstrated, then much of what the artist does in his art studio can be art, as Nauman intuited, even if appears to be trash or built in a gaudily commercial medium, or even if it's simply the act of walking around the studio itself. Here the social role of the artist creates the work as much as the artistic concept. Thus Nauman's dispersed and abject sculptures, or his [lists of neon words](http://beautifuldecay.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bruce-nauman-1-e1299486791926.jpg) which, as portions constantly blink on and off, modulate to new ambiguities the ambiguity already present in each phrase, demonstrate a freedom of creation bound to the realm of play opened by the identification of the artist with his social role.\n\n\nOK, so that's enough theorizing from me - change my view! Make me realize that modern art is worthless. I don't care how you do it, but I want to be feeling deep existential dread at the way I've wasted years of my life on a total void by the time I wake up tomorrow morning!

{"input": "CMV: Toilet paper is better than bidets. + \n + I am American and have used toilet paper my whole life. I've had to use a bidet the past week for medical reasons, and I think that toilet paper is the far superior option.\n\n**Cleanliness**\n\nIn this area, I prefer toilet paper for a few reasons. First of all, there is actual visual confirmation that you've got it all. With bidets you just have to keep spraying until you think you're good. And as the amount of wiping/bidet-ing can vary greatly, the visual aspect is a great help. (I used a towel to dab afterwards, as toilet paper doesn't hold up against all the water.)\n\nSecondly, a bidet shouldn't be necessary as people (should) shower daily. Many people like to point out that bidets are better because they rinse away bacteria and other nastiness. But, a shower with actual soap and water and scrubbing should do that job much better than just water alone.\n\n**\"But you wouldn't just wipe it away if you got some on your hands!\"**\n\nNo, and I don't think you'd just rinse it away either. You'd use soap and water and scrubbing. Another point, your hands are usually the first thing you use to touch something. Until you grab things with your bare ass, wiping is just as good.\n\n**Comfort**\n\nGood quality toilet paper is amazing. It's soft, thick, almost like Kleenex. Hell, you could wipe with Kleenex if you wanted. Point is that high quality stuff is glorious. On the other hand, you're getting a cold spray of water in a very sensitive area. Even if you have a super luxury bidet that uses heated water, it's still basically shooting water up your ass. Even low quality toilet paper is better than that. In a shower the water flows down, which is much less uncomfortable. With a bidet there's also the added trouble of being all drippy with water while you move to towel off. And unless you want to reach into the bowl with a towel while you're still sitting on it, you're going to have to at least move up to a squat to towel off. (Those with an air dryer feature may alleviate this somewhat, but toweling will probably still be necessary if the air hand dryers are anything to go by.)\n\n**Price**\n\nI understand bidets cost less. But for me and where I am in life, I can and will pay extra for quality. There must be many others who feel the same, or else only single ply sand paper toilet paper would exist. In this area bidets are better, but I think that if this is the reason someone buys a bidet it would be because they have to save money.\n\n**Eco friendliness**\n\nI think we're past the whole 'save the trees' business. Reforestation is greater than reforestation in most of the world. Bidets may actually do more harm in low water and drought areas, if everyone dropped toilet paper and got bidets the gallons would add up.\n\nTo clarify; I'm talking about a bidet for home use, that's built into the toilet. The bidets that are completely separate just seem impractical.\n\n\nSo, CMV.\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: Statutory Rape/Standard Rape laws are sexist and should be completely redone to make the trial more equal. And statutory rape should be abolished all together. + \n + A topic that I have been aware of for a long time has been brought up to my attention again. [This](http://www.wnem.com/story/29722286/young-man-fooled-by-girl-on-hookup-app-wants-off-sex-offender-list#ixzz3i1vo9lzT) appeared on my news feed today and the main key that made me upset was this part of the article was this \"The 14-year-old girl in the case has admitted she lied about her age on the hookup app and said the encounter was consensual, but that's not a valid defense under current laws.\"  There is no reason why that shouldn't be a viable defense, I mean, that sentence alone should make any person automatically innocent and the only punishment that should be dealt, if any, should be against the person who lied about their age.\n\nI bring up that rape laws should also be redone. One example was that a youtuber I watch (He wouldn't lie about said things because his whole channel is about social issues and such, and hasn't lied about anything yet. MrRepzion is that guy). He was in a bad relationship and decided to end it. Now the girl was very upset, so upset that she decided to create a fake rape claim, and the only reason Repzion was found guilty, was that his ex mistakenly decided to tell him over text that she claimed a false one, so he had evidence that it was false. Another one was an old friend of mine (17) was dating a 15 year old from my school. He broke up with her, and then filed a false statutory rape case against him, with parental help. Which he plead guilty.\n\n~~I also bring up abolishing statutory rape laws because I see no use for them. If the sex is consensual, then there shouldn't be any punishment, because both parties wanted it, and with how they are set up, I guarantee that the guy will almost always be the one being punished, with the girl off scotch free. And if the sex wasn't consensual, then it should be considered just rape, rendering the statutory rape law useless.~~ Realized this would never be okay.

The $100-200 you save isn't worth the work it takes to assemble the thing and troubleshoot faulty parts.\n\nSo I had a 100% functional pc I built years ago, and decided I'd \"rebuild\" it with a skylake CPU/new motherboard/new cooler/ddr4 RAM.\n\nI was short on cash, so I decided to reuse the same GPU for now, 100% functional before I built the new PC.\n\nPackage arrives, I take a couple hours to assemble it as the cooler is a bit tricky. But I get it right, but the system only outputs to the onboard VGA. Onboard DVI and GPU outputs don't work, but the GPU fans are spinning. Yes, the PCIe power connectors are connected, and yes I properly seated the GPU.\n\nSo I look online, and people tell me I probably just need drivers. So I install windows just fine. Try to get drivers off of AMD's site, install fails. Not surprising, because the GPU won't show in the device manager. Great.\n\nSo I turn it off, open it up, and put a spare GPU into the same slot. Still no image. I then take that spare GPU, and put it in the 2nd PCIe slot. Magically, it works. But this PCIe slot operates at x8, and isn't big enough to fit high end GPUs because the SATA ports are in the way. So no bueno.\n\nI decide that the PCIe slot is broken, and take the pc apart to get the board ready to RMA. I decide I need a PC while I wait for the new parts, so I reassemble my old build, which took even more time.\n\nSystem boots, image displayed but now the video card fans don't spin. System restarts after a few minutes abruptly. Obviously, this means that the card is overheating due to no active cooling.\n\nPut in spare card, works fine. So the new motherboard I bought fried the video card I own due to a falty PCIe slot, and chances are Newegg or ASUS won't cover that, judging by what I read online.\nSo now I'm down $600 I spent on new parts, 2 days worth of time I spent troubleshooting(which I could have made a lot if I worked those days), and now I'm stuck using a low end GPU as the motherboard fried my $200 one.\n\nThere's a reason that professional corporations just buy OEM PCs like Dell instead of hiring people to build them. The build process is all fine if you know what you're doing and all parts work, but the moment you get 1 DOA part that fries other parts, then it's pure hell to figure out what to replace, and what to keep. The time spent troubleshooting poor parts isn't worth the miniscule amount of money you save.\n\nI've been working in a PC repair shop for a year, took a year long pc repair course, and I'm comptia A+ certified, so I know what I'm doing, for the most part. But imagine if this happened to a beginner, who is just going off of guides found online with no experience behind them in troubleshooting. They would have no clue what part to blame, what to RMA, what to buy. \n\nUnless you're extremely frugal, or enjoy building PCs, you're better off just buying an OEM PC.

{"input": "CMV: I think an insurance company only for elite drivers is a great idea + \n + I believe that there exists a great market for auto insurance that only insures elite drivers.  Personally, I have never made a claim in the 17+ years that I have been driving and paying auto insurance and I believe that I should be paying a lot less than I am.  If I had the money to invest, I would start an insurance company that requires the following of all policy holders, no exceptions:\n\n1) No less than 10 years of driving experience.  \n2) Zero at fault accidents in at least 10 years.\n\n3) Zero claims filed with your previous insurance company in the last 10 years.\n\n4) No moving violations in the last 7 years (eliminates one third of fatalities*).\n\n5) No DUI or felony driving convictions, for your lifetime (eliminates one third of fatalities*).\n\n*http://www.carinsurance.com/Articles/How-many-accidents.aspx?WT.qs_osrc=fxb\n\nI understand that the qualifications are somewhat subjective, but I don't see a fair way to avoid that.  You could say that you are still a very low liability if you have only 1 speeding ticket for 5 mph over the limit 6 years ago, but that opens the door for a guy who has 2 tickets.  You have to draw the line somewhere.\n\nTo answer some likely questions: if you are on a policy and do something that causes you to no longer , the claim is paid but your policy is cancelled until you meet the requirements again.  No, you cannot add your teen driver to your policy, no matter how great you think they did in driving school.  Yes, your spouse is listed as an excluded driver if they do not also meet the requirements. All others are listed as excluded drivers.   \n\nI believe that enforcing the above would drive down claims enough that rates could be drastically reduced.  The main people who are opposed to this would be those who are butthurt that they don't qualify.  That's just too bad.  This is a (hypothetical) private company that has the right to refuse service to those who do not meet its qualifications, just as other insurance companies do.\n\nThe following is just an observation that I tried to backup with data but I have not found anything.  It does not seem to me that car accidents are evenly distributed.  It seems that some people smash up their car every couple of years and others have never caused such an event.  As such, the requirements are intended to disqualify about 90% of the people on the road today, and offer insurance only to those who have consistently demonstrated a high skill level and good judgement.\n\nI believe many good drivers would flock to this service because they are tired of spending their money on a service they have never needed to use and have a very low probability of using in the future.  This is not a service for everyone, but for those who qualify I think it could add a lot of value.  To CMV, you will have to convince me that this is not a viable business idea.  You will not CMV with responses that state any version of \"I'm a good driver but I don't met X, and I think I'm special and should still be able to be insured thru this company.\"  Thanks.\n\n\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: If gay and interracial marriage is legal in a state, then polygamous marriage should also be legal in that state. + \n + A few things to note before a start:\n\n1. I'm not arguing to the contrary against gay marriage. I am for gay marriage as I am for polygamous marriages.\n\n2. I'm not arguing for forced marriage or arranged marriages where several women are forced to marry a single man, like in various religious sects, but the concept of a marriage containing multiple people as a whole.\n\n3. I am as much for polyandrous marriages as I am for polygynous marriages. (i.e. women can have multiple husbands in addition to men having multiple wives.\n\n4. Willing to discuss this *legally* and *ethically* in seperate spheres, but let's try not and mix the two together too much, unless absolutely necessary. It is assumed that gay marriage is both legal and ethical for the purpose of this discussion. If you believe gay marriage should be illegal or is unethical, then those arguments have merit towards polygamous marriage as well.\n\nAlrighty, now onto my main points.\n\n1. Polyamarous people deserve the same right to equality, to marry who they love, just like homosexuals, and heterosexuals. Polyamarous relationships are no less moral than homosexual relationships, and relationships between consenting adults should be able to be consummated in marriage.\n\n2. Marriage was not made legal by a popular vote in many places. The only country to legalize it via a popular vote was Ireland a week or so ago, everywhere else had it decided by judges or representatives. In the US, interracial marriage and gay marriage has been ruled as legal by courts, not voted in. Public opinion towards polygamous marriage is irrelevant.\n\n3. When it comes to raising children, one can assume that since having a single parent results in worse-off children, then having a higher amount of parental figures and providers would make for a similar, if not better child-rearing than having one parent, two parents, or two parents of the same sex (all of which are legal). [Source] (http://archive.news-leader.com/article/20121125/NEWS01/311250054/single-parents-Ozarks-poverty) [Source 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_House)\n\n4. When it comes to insurance, legal proceedings, etc. everything can be easily adjusted to treating additional spouses as additional dependents (as where such institutions are adjusted for additional children). Yes, it is true that the current system does not allow for it, but it can be adjusted. When it comes to division of property, divorce, etc. things will simply be divided by the amount of people participating in the marriage, i.e. if there are three people, everything gets split 33%, or if the other two remain married, it gets split 66%. Prenuptual agreements can take care of anything that may be complicated by this if spouses have different intentions for how things are split. There will be a cap where insurance coverage/tax benefits end, i.e. if you have more than 7 children you stop receiving benefits for any more. For taxes and insurance, children are treated similarly to spouses, and additional spouses shouldn't complicate things out of reason. The specifics as to what the cap will be, how things get split, life and death decisions, etc. can be hammered out by individual states and individual people participating in a marriage, just like in other marriages.\n\n5. Sham marriages containing two people that don't love each other, of the same or different sex are currently legal. *Chuck and Larry* marriages are currently possible, the only difference in allowing polygamous marriages would be to not allow odd numbers of people to participate in such marriages, rather than being in pairs. The difference here is insignificant.\n\n6. The idea that polyamarous people are treated \"equal\" because *everyone* is only allowed to marry one spouse is the same type of \"equality\" where *everyone* is only allowed to marry within their race or sex. This is nonsensical. Everyone being held to the same standard of law does not work when people love people outside of what is socially accepted.\n\n7. Polyamarous relationships aren't any less stable than homosexual relationships or heterosexual relationships. Even if they were, it shouldn't have any weight, as interracial relationships are much less stable than intraracial relationships. To argue that polygamous marriage shouldn't be allowed because of a instability in relationships is also to argue against interracial marriage.\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: I think that individuals who identify as transgender have an underlying mental illness that should be worked through in therapy rather than corrected by invasive medical procedures. + \n + I'm going to try to attack this issue from multiple angles and I want to preface by saying that I am NOT trying in any way to attack the transgender community. \n\n\n\n\n-First off, I want to begin by discussing the very premise of labeling oneself as trans. I have an issue with transgender people saying that they are born with a [gendered] brain in a [wrong gendered] body. For many years women have been fighting for equality with men and in this light it is abhorrent to say that men and women have brains that are different. Feminists (both men and women) have fought hard to erase the entrenched beliefs of a patriarchal society. For example, to be a male yet be interested in feminine things and FEEL feminine is only upholding the belief that there are certain traits unique to and can only be possessed by females. This is the premise to my argument so bear with me. \n\n\n\nAlas, as stated above, I believe that being transgender can be one's own way (subconsciously) to mentally rebel against society's very deep and entrenched gender roles. \n\n\n\n-Secondly, I see thoughts of transgender individuals to be patterned similarly to the thoughts of individuals with the mental illness known as body dysmorphic disorder. Persons with BDD tend to have an obsession with a certain part of their body or facet of their personality that they blow out of proportion to reality. This obsession causes sufferers a great deal of emotional pain and can lead them to take extreme measures to remedy the perceived problem. Most people with BDD are adolescents. \n\nFor example, someone with BDD may be so obsessed with the shape of their nose that they seek surgery to reduce their concern and obsession. However, surgery is not a treatment for BDD. BDD is a manifestation of extreme anxiety and depression and fixing the obsession does not remove said mental illnesses from the person. Most individuals who do go to extreme measures as such tend to continue experience the anxiety and depression that manifested itself as an obsession with the shape of their nose.\n\n\n-Now, in that vein how are we to say that the plight of transgender people is any different? Feelings of extreme anxiety and depression directed at the person's gender, correction of gender and not a lot of resolution with the underlying mental illness.\n\n\nSee this study: [Long-Term Follow-Up of Transsexual Persons Undergoing Sex Reassignment Surgery: Cohort Study in Sweden.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3043071/) Research has shown that \"Persons with transsexualism, after sex reassignment, have considerably higher risks for mortality, suicidal behaviour, and psychiatric morbidity than the general population. Our findings suggest that sex reassignment, although alleviating gender dysphoria, may not suffice as treatment for transsexualism, and should inspire improved psychiatric and somatic care after sex reassignment for this patient group.\" \n\n\n\n\nThis is my case.

It's not a mistake that the activities that are illegal and/or most popularly hated in the US are those associated with the poor or with cultures unfamiliar to most americans. Another factor is the cuteness of the animal (I have a soft spot for snakes and insects so I notice this)-- The popular, often almost gleeful, condemnation some of these activities is inseparable from hatred of outsiders and the oppressed.\n\nFor those who cherish animal life in a less arbitrary way it could seem like, this blood-thirsty mob has, for once taken, the correct side. But, this is an illusion-- we are are harmed by the inconsistency and emotion-driven fervor of these people who would suggest hanging as punishment for dog fights, then blithely eat chicken from a large producer, or smile at photos of their uncle posed with half-dead and suffocating sword fish.\n\nI think there are important questions here, I don't have the answers either. My point is not that all of these actions are equivalent, but rather that they have more in common than many people care to acknowledge. I would not be sad to live in a meatless, leather-free future, it might make me feel old, like someone's homophobic grandma who tries, but can't quite shake deeply learned prejudice. But, I think we have no choice but to recognize the cruelty in our own culture as, at least, similar to the cruelty found in other cultures. Most people I know personally who care about these issues already think about this rather deeply, so my criticisms are not for them. Many animal rights activists *do* see the parallels but it is hard to hear their intelligent arguments over the din consisting of little but mad-vitriol over certain animals (especially dogs) being harmed in certain ways. This level of anger that never seems to show up for pigs, snakes and fish-- or for the actions of male hunters (but women who hunt can get death threats) much of this comes from people who, like me, use leather, kill and eat fish (or think it's normal) and buy products like eggs or bacon.\n\nThis consistency issue is a big deal to me because calling an action cruel in one context but normal or a sport in another speaks to an unwillingness to contemplate life from diverse perspectives. And there are so many things we ought to be questioning... beyond the torture of fish.\n\nThis critical moral question about how and if we can end much of this cruelty deserves an answer from humans who recognize the common joys and failings of each other.

{"input": "CMV: Age of consent laws are based on faulty anecdotes + \n + Age of consent laws around the world vary dramatically, and even within the US there is a wide range of things that are acceptable or unacceptable depending on what state you are in. Most people are in support of age of consent laws, and will very aggressively assert that they want to protect the children. Many people will tell you that a sexual relationship between an adult and a child who is X years old is unquestionably damaging to the child, where X is usually a completely arbitrary number.\n\nThere is no doubt to me that an adult is capable of abusing a child in a relationship, and that the adult is capable of abusing the child in a way that the child believes they are consenting and does not believe they are being abused. I also believe that adults are capable of doing this to eachother in relationships where both people are of the consenting age.\n\nWhere things start to get shaky is the point when people start asserting that all sexual relationships are abusive once the 'victim' is below a certain age. I do not believe that there is sufficient scientific evidence to back up this claim. I do not believe that healthy sexual relationships occurring between adults and teens or children are given the proper room to breathe or prosper: as soon as a child is discovered to be in a sexual relationship with an adult, that child will be told repeatedly that their sexual partner is a bad person and that their sexual partner has abused them. I believe that this alone is sufficient to damage the child, regardless of whether the sexual relationship itself was damaging. Children are highly vulnerable to suggestion.\n\nI believe that more rigorous scientific investigation is necessary to justify the age of consent laws, and that once the scientific evidence comes out, the age of consent laws should be adjusted accordingly. I know that, as a teenage boy, especially by 14 (but even, to a smaller degree, as early as 8 or 9) I would have been excited to engage in a sexual relationship with an attractive female. I don't see how this would have resulted in abuse or psychological damage (assuming, of course, that my partner had my best interests in mind). But that's just the problem, it's nothing more than an anecdote. People who oppose my views also provide anecdotes.\n\nThe amount of scientific research in this area is lacking, and lots of the mania surrounding child abuse laws come from unproven ideas about child innocence and susceptibility to abuse. As an even bolder step, I believe most age of consent laws are largely baseless as far as genuine evidence is concerned. (as a side note, these beliefs also extend to other child abuse laws, and also extend to student-teacher relationship laws).\n\nPlease, CMV\n\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

I believe that although rare, it is justifiable to discriminate if the other group's acts are radically going against your belief and serving them will make you feel like you committed a sin against your beliefs and values. So for example, I believe that the pizzeria should be allowed to refuse service to a gay wedding, if he feels like doing that will violate his belief system.

{"input": "CMV:I think the argument against Zoophillia based on lack of consent is only an effective argument for a tiny portion of the population. + \n + So the most popular non-religious argument against beastiality is that such actions are wrong because it is impossible to get any kind of consent. I think it is possible to argue otherwise (for some animals it is very easy to read their emotional state), but I won't argue that because I think the whole idea that consent would be necessary in these situations is completely inconsistent with how animals are treated by the vast majority of our population, including vegetarians.\n\nExample 1(for the vegetarians, but applicable for everyone): Pet ownership. Do we get consent when we take a puppy from his parents? Do we get consent when we neuter them? If you assume that consent is essential in animal/human relationships, pet ownership itself becomes a kind of slavery or imprisonment. The owner provides food and housing, the pet is imprisoned and provides entertainment to the owner. Any argument you could run about this being justifiable without consent would frighteningly similar to arguments for why slavery in the U.S. was good for many of the slaves. Arguments that they \"seem happy,\" or \"they don't run away\" are meaningless when you have kidnapped an animal and brought it up to be dependent on you. I'm not saying pet ownership IS slavery; I'm saying that the only way it pet ownership can be justified is if you toss out the idea of needing consent for our interactions with animals.\n\nExample 2(for the carnivores): The vast majority of human beings eat animals. If you are one of this majority, the idea that you would ask an animals consent for anything is laughable. You could argue that unnecessary cruelty is still wrong, but much beastiality clearly involves the pleasuring of the animal, not the torturing of it.

However I am going to counter my own argument here in saying that you can't prove that rocks aren't sentient either in the philosophical sense, but there is at least reason to believe that a fetus is more alive than a rock. When you have sex, you know it's a possibility to get pregnant, it's kind of like its part of the terms and conditions of sex, yeah it sucks but that's the reality. Now I realize that it's not always consensual sex, and having to carry the child of someone who assaulted you is an absolutely horrendous thing, I would not wish that on my worst enemy, and I don't say that lightly, I really truly wouldn't. I can only imagine feeling as though I would just want to tear the child out no matter what. Never the less, life is life, a fetus is innocent, and the best I can recommend is some extreme therapy taken to whatever (healthy) extent necessary to help a person cope with such a thing.

(This is also why I don't get mad at animal rights activists, I've seriously considered going vegan, and I kind of think following my own philosophy, it's selfish and hypocritical of me that I'm not.) I feel as though people are arguing two completely different things, a persons right to do what they want with their body, and a fetus's right to live.

Even shouting matches still occur despite the fact that any rational adult should be able to carry out a calm conversation and either keep themselves under control, or withdraw if they feel they cannot.   \n\nSo the short version of the CMV is: Being quick or accepting of violence and anger is already partially recognised as a mental disability/illness, but we're not doing enough to combat it. As a global society, we should be more active in teaching children that it's literally never OK in standard adult life (self-defence being the only exception), and if we ever see it in adults, we should be quick to recommend them to therapy in the long-term, and ask them why they feel anger/violence is acceptable in the short term when any sane person would know it's the wrong thing to do.\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

I believe that it will be immoral to manually drive in the distant future when they are common. Firstly, by manually driving, you are putting people in a lot more danger than you would while riding in an automatic vehicle. Your car would not be interfacing with the rest of the vehicles on the road, and you would be far more likely to cause an accident. If self driving cars become universal, then we could see the removal of streetlights and other road equipment meant to organize human driven traffic. Cars would be much more efficient, being able to stop and start and at the same time. There would be virtually no road deaths at all, and absolutely no reason to drive cars outside of events like motor sports or other things like that.

{"input": "CMV: Any life other than one of poverty is unethical. + \n + Lets start by looking at a situation:\n\nImagine you are walking by a shallow river on your way to a ball when you see a child drowning. You're wearing some pretty expensive clothes (lets say 500 pounds) that will no doubt be ruined if you jump into the river. Saving this child doesn't put you in danger as you can stand in this river while the child being smaller cannot. Do you jump into that river to save that child? \n\nLet's say you encounter that same river with a different child in it the next day while wearing your rolex watch. Do you jump into that river to save the child? \n\nNow lets look at the real world. More than 1.3 billion people live in extreme poverty (less than 80p a day) and 7.6 million children are estimated to have died before their 5th birthday in 2010. Many of these are from poverty, preventable diseases and illnesses. Money can help provide infrastructure for schools, hospitals, sanitation facilities, vaccinations etc which no doubt will help reduce child mortality rates. Once you look at the world through this lens then it is easy enough to look at the world in terms of opportunity cost. This iphone or 100 life saving vaccinations. An expensive house or cheap government housing and a new well providing water for a village. One may argue that there is a difference between the example and this and that is distance. These children are much further away but I don't see how that dilutes your moral responsibility to them. Therefore, it seems that any money that you keep must be worth a child's life, education etc or be allocated to some other duty such as child rearing where you have a responsibility to give time and money (for schools, healthcare etc) to make sure that your child grows up to be a socially productive member of society. I know that sounds like a very cold perspective on what parenting is about but i couldn't think of another way to phrase it haha.\n\nI will assume that most people think that you should save the child but this specifically is why I would save the child. I'm looking at this from the stance of virtue ethics (Aquinas) and I believe that by allowing this child to die shows a lack of charity and isn't positively building character. I can't justify losing a life in exchange for 500 pounds.\n\nBut,  I think even taken from the stance of consequentialism (believing that consequences should inform your moral thinking) or deontological ethics (believing that laws inform your moral stance) you would still reach the eventual conclusion that you must jump into that river:\n\nConsequentialism (i.e. Utilitarianism):\nYou would have to argue that having 500 pounds will lead to greater pleasure/happiness than that life and I don't think you can justify that.\n\nDeontological ethics (i.e. Kant):\nI only really understand Kant so he's the one that I will briefly (very briefly) talk about but allowing that child to die breaks the categorical imperative as if you allowed that act to become universal you would be devaluing human life by saying that it has a price tag.\n\nI've only briefly talked about why I think the child should be saved as I take it as a assumption that most people would save the child but I will be willing to discuss my ethical stance more thoroughly if anyone asks me about it but i didn't want my post to only appeal to those who have studied philosophy.\n\nThanks for your answers!\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: The writers of Charlie Hebdo are heroes, and those who do not recognize this are ignorant fools + \n + At the beginning of this year, multiple staff members at Charlie Hebdo were slaughtered in their offices. The reason for their murders were due to cartoons they published - satirizing the prophet Muhammed. Whilst the majority of people I've seen have been firmly in Charlie Hebdo's camp, there seems to be a noticeable backlash against Charlie Hebdo and some of the things they've done - to the extent that people have protested against PEN's (a freedom of speech organisation) decision to award them honours. I want to address some of these claims.\n\nA Guardian article recently had this to say about CH:\n\n\nFirst issue - this is a complete dehumanization of the staff who lost their lives that day. Suddenly, a murder becomes a narrative; that way, we don't have to see it as a crime. Furthermore, I imagine that Mustapha Ourad, copy editor of Charlie Hebdo, would be surprised to hear that he is white (if he were alive to hear it).\n\nThere are these claims that the writers at CH are racists (a claim that is demonstrably wrong, as I shall go on to explain), who oppress 'marginalized' peoples with cartoons. I suppose the people who make these claims either simply ignore, or do not see, the fact that the people who killed the cartoonists are very, very, very obviously racists themselves - demonstrated by their targeting of a Jewish community following the attack on CH - making them authentic, evidently racist killers. No one mentions that part of the 'narrative', do they?\n\nThe claim that CH is racist is an absurd one. I'll demonstrate why. Take this image from the [New Yorker](http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/files/2015/04/original.jpg). Say you knew nothing of The New Yorker or wider US culture. What do you think this image conveys? That the New Yorker thinks Obama is a terrorist - that would be the only logical conclusion you could deduce.\n\nThe real purpose of that image is to parody the extreme right wingers of US politics and their claims about Obama - tea party claims that he is a terrorist, muslim, and unable to stand for presidency. To understand this, you require an understanding of current US political culture.\n\nNow, take this [widely circulated cover of CH's apparent racism](https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2925558/CHARLIE-HEBDO.0.jpg). It shows Boko Haram sex slaves shouting 'Don't touch our welfare'. Now, imagine you have no understanding of Frances wider political culture of CH. What do you think this image conveys? That CH is a racist, right wing magazine.\n\nNow, if you *did* happen to possess an understanding of Charlie Hebdo and France's wider political culture; you'd immediately understand that the image is doing something extremely similar to the one on the New Yorker. It's parodying the extreme paranoia of the right wing, anti immigration parties that began to arise in France by displaying enslaved, pregnant, Boko Haram sex slaves invading France and taking their money.\n\nAnyone with any understanding of French culture and CH know for a fact that CH is a left wing magazine that has routinely expressed their desire for immigrants to remain in their country, and that the rights of immigrants be respected. Ignorant people with no prior knowledge of parisian culture, of the history of CH, make these absurd, disgusting, disrespectful claims about CH.\n\n\nFirstly, if attacking 'marginalized peoples' is such a major issue - then their would be zero criticism, parody, or satire from the left aimed at the working class peoples who voted for the Tea Party, Ukip, of the French NF. Is that the case? If Tea Partiers, or the French NF, had gunned down CH - would their be claims that CH's vicious attacks on their ideology lay hold to the blame of the attacks? Would that argument be defended?\n\nThe people who argue this way must therefore agree that there is an Islamic blasphemy law that is enforced at gunpoint - regardless of whether a population wants it - and that you are to blame if you are slaughtered for saying something other people don't like.\n\nCharlie Hebdo was a beacon of light, a welcome friend, and an invaluable ally to moderate and liberal Muslims across the globe. \n\n\nIslam has no special place. It should receive the same level of parody, criticism, satire, and insults that every other religion and ideology has - if not more so given it's followers reluctance to accept this. It's followers have no right to demand people not to write this way. Muslims have zero right to murder those who don't believe the same things as they do, or insult the things they believe. Muslims who support those who commit these murders are equally as disgusting and retched as those who commit them. \n\n\nYou also shouldn't kill people. This is not an argument I take seriously - Islam *needs* criticism, parody, and satire, and muslims need to see it, in order to understand that in Western Countries, this is an important aspect of our culture. Islam is not above reproach, it is not above satire. The reason for the killings given doesn't even make sense anyway - Islam restricts muslims from drawing Muhammed. Non-muslims can draw whatever they want.\n\nI understand there are people who do not agree with CH. I'm imploring you to explain to me why I'm incorrect in my support for them.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: If straight and cis people attend a Pride parade, they should spend some of their time there volunteering. + \n + Context: I'm a straight cis man with a lot of straight friends (as well as LGBTQA+ friends) who often go to Boston Pride Parade and NYC Pride Parade. I've never gone to one myself (always find out about it a few days after it happens), but I'm planning on going to volunteer at next year's Boston parade, assuming I'm home from school in time.\n\nI personally get a little uncomfortable when I see straight people partying hard at Pride parades. To me, the parades are supposed to celebrate marginalized social groups who are often shoved under wave after wave of oppression and hatred the other 364 days of the year and has this one day to fully let loose and celebrate in the face of a culture who still may not accept them in the way that they'd like. When straight people jump in, it almost feels like they're co-opting the one day in which non-straight people are finally in control. It seems to me to be similar to straight people putting a rainbow filter over their profile pictures - in theory, it might be OK, but in practice it shifts the attention from the LGBTQA+ people who deserve it onto the straight person who steps in. Almost like a \"Look at me, I'm celebrating pride! Look at how great I am!\"\n\nAnd, yeah, to a certain extent I think this display of solidarity is good. Gay/trans/queer rights won't move forward without the support of those already in power - straight people - and it's nice to see people united across gender and sexuality boundaries in order to celebrate how far we've come and prepare for how far we still have to go. That being said, though, I think there's a point at which a display of solidarity becomes less about the people for whom the solidarity is shown and more about the people who are \"showing\" the solidarity. I think that at a certain point, support for the LGBTQA+ community can transition into an exercise in self-promotion and narcissism, and I'm not super comfortable with that.\n\nThis is why I think that straight/cis people who participate in Pride parades should spend some of that participation on volunteering. The parades really run on volunteers, and if a straight/cis person spends time doing the thankless task of picking up trash, filling and lugging big containers of water everywhere, or making sure a first-aid tent is properly staffed, it helps show support for the LGBTQA+ community in a way that simply taking selfies with a shirtless parader will never be able to. I think it's a great way to be an ally to the community in a way that doesn't obnoxiously trumpet that allyship, and it might teach people more about what really makes the revelry run smoothly and give them a new appreciation for something many almost take for granted.\n\ntl;dr Volunteering is a helpful form of allyship for straight/cis people in a way that just going to the parade and celebrating is not.\n\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: The President of the US should not be in charge of the military. + \n + This view will be broken down into a few main points; Lack of Training, Corruption, Abuse of Power, and conclude with Overall Role of the President.\n\n* Lack of Training\n\nThe primary and most notable is that the President doesn't need any no formal training or experience with the Army. Now it may be true that the brunt of the responsibility for this is in the hands of the Generals but the fact that a no experience individual gets such influence on the behavior of the largest army on the planet, is just absurd. The president can go against the council of those generals and against the council of the CIA which has been seen many times in the last few decades.\n\n* Corruption\n\nHaving a single person with this much power over the army lends itself to corruption either from the outside or even worse, corruption from that individual who would use the army for personal reasons. For example, George Bush 2nd invaded Iraq in part due to the fact that Osama Bin Laden had attempted to kill George's dad in the past. He made the move with the army against the recommendation of the CIA who said the attacks came from Saudi Arabia, to get the man who hated his daddy.\n\n* Abuse of Power\n\nIt is frankly idiotic that the person in control of the army, can use that as a resource to gain 'Emergency Powers'. This is just a perfectly exploitable glitch in the system. This is made especally potent when you take into account that the president for some reason doesn't need permission from congress to go to war, invade another country, or deploy the military any way they choose.\n\nThe president also can abuse their power to get money that could circumvent the power of congress, allowing this one person to circumvent many powers of the legislative branch, and judicial branch; goodbye checks and balances. This still occurs through documented selling of firearms over seas after a 'totally legit invasion' of panama, iraq, or wherever else. \n\n* Overall Role of the President\n\nThe president is a figure head more than anything, cluttering the role of the president with control over the armed forces just adds unnecessary strain to the role of the president who should focus on being Head of State and communication with the public, not foreign affairs, the state of the army, or anything of the sort.\n\n* Conclusion\n\nSo what should the president be of not commander in chief? What the president is now; Head of State and Head of Government. I see no issue with having the elected office of the president simply being a figurehead role, and having commander in chief be a separate role chosen either by the president or through a panel with The Generals of the Army.\n\nMany people say the president actually has less power than people think, and this is true because many people think the president controls legislation, which they do not. But the president does have more power than a single individual in a balanced government should have; power of the army, power of uncontested 'emergency powers', and a nigh endless amount of unbounded cash to use globally.\n\n* To CMV\n\nI must see a reasonable argument as to why each of these is wrong because if even one of them stands it is a legitimate reason to remove the Commander in Chief title from the Presidency.\n\nor\n\nYou must show a reason why transferring the role to a separate person or to the army  leaders as a group, would be a worse alternative than its current state.\n\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: Teaching personal finance in schools and encouraging saving would end badly + \n + Hello everybody! \n\nI was in a reddit thread earlier where someone was preaching the importantce of teaching personal finance in schools, encouraging people to start pension contributions as soon as they start earning, ect. ect. \n\nI'm an economics undergrad so I have a little (it is only a little) understanding of savings, but I believe that a drastic increase in savings would be a catastrophe for a few reasons:\n\n1) Intrest rates. The current interest is LOW, if not negative in real terms. This means that there arn't sufficient (safe) borrowers to allocate the funds to. Increasing the savings more risks entering a liquidity trap.\n\n2) Stagnation of demand. If you encourage people to save then they arn't spending (obviously). This is probably the worst thing that could happen right now (or in the next few years). \n\n3) Asset price bubbles. With lots of savings being depositied banks will be forced to 'do' something with that money.  Some of the things they will do is buy assets, or lend to buyers of assets: such as Bonds, stocks, property. ect. Rapid increases in the purchase of these has historically lead to their prices becoming speculative. It also prices out of the market the very people who you are teaching should save: Young people. \n\n\nSo thats why  I think encouraging, on mass, a new generation of young people to start savings to that degree would end badly.\n\nI want to understand why others think it shoudl be encouraged so I'm posting here.

I don't see this as a viable argument, because if someone is going to leave, then they have a reason to. Even if its a bad reason, or a really good reason, making the person stay by the threat of losing lots of money and/or possessions will only make the marriage worse and worse and cause the couple to fight more and more. \n\nI see no reason whatsoever why anyone should be able to take legal action if their spouse decides to leave then. If someone leaves a marriage, it means they are unhappy with it, or have lost feelings for the other person. And like I said in my first statement, making the person stay in marriage until a joint divorce is (if ever) made by the threat of the person leaving losing a lot of money and/or possessions will only make the marriage worse and worse, leaving 1 or both of the people suffering for years. \n\nAnother reason why this is bad is if one person is unhappy in their marriage, and the spouse is forcing them to stay by means of threatening legal action, will leave the unhappy spouse in a terrible marriage for years, or possibly for the rest of their lives.\n\nChange my View Reddit!\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

It may very well help them, but it is without a doubt true that a pirate violates the owner's property rights, and the elements of the contract they sign.  Ultimately this argument can be ignore, because it is not just for someone to burn down another house just for petty revenge even if the ultimate result is a hefty insurance payment for the victim.\n2) *It's the freedom of information age!*\nNo, it isn't, since the information isn't free. Information isn't, nor should it be, inherently free. Classified military secrets, passwords, SSNs, browser histories, and credit card numbers are \"information\" but most certainly should not be given for free to anyone and everyone.\n3) *The poor wouldn't have bought it anyway. Besides, how do you expect me to pay for it?*\nAnother disregarding of morality, but let's address this directly. Information that is pirated, aka games, books, movies, etc. are luxuries. They are not necessities. Thus, while the poor may very well have not bought it anyway, they still violated property rights for something not in any way,shape, or form necessary for their survival or well-being. Stealing food, water, or money in order to purchase the former may, at times, be justified, but the theft of luxuries is not necessary for your survival. \n4) *We should transition to donation system.*\nThis is one of the more laughable positions I have seen and so often comes from the exact same people who argue that charity is not enough to help the poor(which they almost always claim they are). That argument, which I agree with, is especially true of art and copyrights. Why do you have to pay the electrician for the work he did to your house? After all, you never took anything from him, all he did was rearrange the bits in your house to work again, something you could of done yourself. All he lost was time, and that's not illegal to take, is it? So then why do we not hear of the same donation systems for blue collar workers like this?

I've since been prescribed vyvanse. Now, the difference on this stuff is incredible. I am motivated, I am hardworking, and I am happy when I'm on it.

I want to disregard this part for discussion, however. 2 reasons: 1) I only want to talk about the people without ADHD but who want to self-improve. 2) those who want to abuse can already do so in that its not extremely difficult to get it illegally.\n\nOne other point is that it provides an unfair advantage to students. Well, I see it as a choice. If you use it it is entirely up to the individual. The people who feel disadvantaged have an equal opportunity to get it (disregarding prices). There are already people without ADHD using the drugs, the only difference is that they pretend to have it. \n\nA final point that I think some people have is the \"zombification\" of students.

When people don't exist, they don't have the capacity to want to exist.  When people suffer, they want to stop suffering.  Shouldn't this mean that we should be more upset over suffering than we are over death?\n\nSay, for example, that a person was so depressed for so long that she decided to kill herself.  It's typically only after someone commits suicide that people get really upset, even though the deceased no longer has feelings to empathize with.  The concerns expressed by survivors are typically along the lines of death being tragic or death being a waste.  When someone is stuck in their own personal hell, however, people's reactions aren't nearly as dramatic.  They usually try to comfort the depressed person and often get so frustrated from the futility of it that they give up on them.  Often, the advice given is to not die.  Isn't this like looking for the forest through the trees?  Isn't there a greater tragedy than death right in front of them?\n\nAnother example is of what is considered dangerous.  Many situations are considered non-dangerous simply because they probably won't result in death.  For example, it's often argued that gender dysphoria isn't a serious condition because it doesn't directly result in death.  This is argued despite the fact that the condition renders many people unable to even want to live.\n\nI've brought up suicidal ideation twice, now.

You may either push the other person off the bridge, which will stop the trolley before it hits the 5 people, which will kill that person, or you can do nothing, which will kill the 5 people.

The purpose of the problem is to present a dilemma between utilitarianism (benefitting the most people in the best way) and deontology (doing one's duty in life as in following basic principles), but I do not believe that doing nothing and allowing the 5 people to die is ethical under either mindset. By neglecting to push the other person off the bridge, you have prioritized your own moral standpoint over the lives of not just one, but 5 other people. The idea that one should not kill may be generally applicable, but to effectively condemn other people to die because you do not want to compromise your morals is incredibly selfish, and goes against the implied deontological principle that one should prioritize the needs of others over one's own (especially if one's needs are really wants).

{"input": "CMV: There is only one possible future worth considering, one with the existence of AGI, and not enough people are planning around it + \n + I believe that when considering the near or far future, there are only one possibility that is worth considering, and would be so transformative that worrying about anything else pales in comparison. That is the creation of Artificial General Intelligence or Artificial Strong Intelligence, whatever you want to call it.\n\nFirst, you have to contend with the issue of whether or not you believe human or greater than level intelligence can even be created. Which I think most people would agree that it is possible, or at least there is nothing fundamental about intelligence that requires it to exist only in humans, or a biological substrate as opposed to some other.\n\nNow, if you do accept that AGI is possible, you must then consider when you think it may be created and whether you or your direct descendants will be affected, if it happens 10,000 years from now, no one alive today would (or really should) care in the slightest. The issue is that unless you are directly involved in the field itself, coming up with a realistic timetable is a difficult problem. Fortunately for us laypeople (myself included), a survey was conducted at a conference of AI experts a few years ago, and concluded that the median optimistic year (10% likelihood) for AGI was 2022, the median realistic year (50% likelihood) was 2040, and the median pessimistic year (100% likelihood) was 2075. Now you are free to disagree with their predictions, but you'd better have damn good cause to do so and be takes seriously by other people. \n\nAll of this taken together has forced me to the realization that there can be no useful forecasting of the near or long term future without considering the impact AGI could have on it. But further to this, no one can even make a solid guess as to what might happen if one is created! There is speculation, some good and some bad, but ultimately this event, the singularity, has an apt name for a reason, we have no prior history or examples from which to learn from! And then, to top it all off, an AGI would likely quickly surpass human intelligence if given the resources, not to mention it may think in such a way that humans could not even follow its logic or reasoning.\n\nTL;DR: So all of this is to say, if you believe AGI is possible, and if you believe that it could come into existence in the nearish future, there is no way to make any easy generalizations about what the future might be like. We have no idea what's coming, and too many people are not factoring in the disruption an AGI could cause, whether for good or ill. Essentially, not enough people are taking this possibility seriously enough, and we're making plans about the future that are affecting people today without taking into account the most profound event in human history.\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

Telling me to be *less* cautious about a valid threat is like telling me to be less cautious about walking through the ghetto at night.\n\nI can't possibly imagine what benefit a psych professional would give to someone who is aware they are irrational. \n\nThe neurotic precautions I take aren't on the scale of not leaving the house because a meteor might hit, they are legitimate precautions that most normal people admit to me are a valid concern, but that they \"try not to think about what could happen\" and thus don't take precautions.\n\nFor example:\n\n-Sleeping in my car instead of a hotel for fear of bed bugs.\n\n-Completely writing off living in apartments as an option for fear of getting bed bugs/cockroaches.\n\n-Throwing away food (as opposed to making a scene or eating it) if I see the food employee handle it with their bare hands, or inadvertently touch the side of the napkin that will grab my pastry with their dirty hands, before picking it up.\n\n-Unscrewing my lightbulbs before I leave my house to confuse potential burglars.\n\n-Taking alternate routes if I see a gravel truck a mile ahead of me on the highway, as opposed to being forced to inevitably pass it and get my car pelted with stone chips.\n\n-Dating, at all. Would not commit to someone unless I was on a desert island where noone else could interfere. Dating in a dynamic world where I am anything less than a top 10% male is too risky, as all it would take is a determined individual with more to offer than myself and an opportunistic time.\n\n-Expiration dates: When in doubt of how long a food item was opened for I throw it away, even if it's a condiment that tends to have a long shelf life. Unknown = toss. I wasted so much money doing this I now exclusively eat out to avoid having to throw food away.\n\n\nSo as you can see I have rational concerns but irrational worry about them. Telling me *not* to do any of those things is asking me to be more vulnerable to threats with relatively high probability of happening. IT isn't like I'm afraid of meteors and volcano's here...

Now, before you rip me to pieces, hear me out.  It's a disability that a person does to themselves.  It's a disability that is completely avoidable, and I think for these reason people don't like to classify it as a disability.  However, I still think it's a disability because it makes it harder to perform every day tasks.\n\nHere's a comparison that I use.  Imagine you cut off your leg with a hacksaw, for no good reason.  You're now missing a leg, and I would consider you to be disabled.  You did it to yourself, and you could have made different life choices to avoid becoming disabled, but you are disabled all the same.  You might argue that someone who cuts off their own leg obviously has some mental issues, but that could be said for a person who allows themself to become severely obese.  For example, depression leads to overeating for many people.\n\nSo why should obese people be denied some of the \"benefits\" of being disabled, just because they did it to themselves?\n\nAnd I hate that I feel like I have to even say this, but no, I am not overweight, and I do not have any personal agenda.  I am honestly curious why people believe this, and I am willing to reconsider my views.\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: Hiragana are superior to Kanji + \n + By superior, I mean more practical/usable as a writing system. I do not mean to argue about the aesthetics of the two writing systems. \n\nBackground: I am a weeaboo, so I elected to take Japanese for my college language requirement (3 quarters). I don't feel like I have all that great of a grasp of the language, but grade wise I received 3.9, 3.9, 3.8 so its not as if I am just completely awful at it. Towards the end of the course though, I found Kanji to be frustrating. Early on we learned simple kanji such as \u4e00, \u4e8c, \u4e09, \u4e0a, \u4e0b, and \u4e2d (these mean 1, 2, 3, above, under, and inside respectively). With these it wasn't had to see how the character corresponded to the meaning. Towards the end though, we were learning kanji with many strokes to express one syllable, and I couldn't see any connection between the kanji and the word - take for example \u52c9\u5f37 (to study). With this, let me outline my points\n\n1. It is easy to entirely memorize Hiragana, and difficult to do so for Kanji: There are ~50 Hiragana, and ~3000 Kanji. Just by numbers, its clear that the former would be easier to learn. Kanji characters in general being more complex than Hiragana ones compounds this issue. Even native Japanese speakers study Kanji through highschool. Furthermore I'd wager a lot of the more complex Kanji don't seem to be very tied to their meaning. This is to be expected given that abstract concepts, colors, etc are difficult to express through said strokes, but even if its to be expected, it still increases the difficulty of memorizing Kanji\n\n2. Hiragana directly correspond to how something is pronounced, Kanji do not: This has several benefits. If you know how to pronounce a word, then it is simple to write it in Hiragana, not true for Kanji - you have to have memorized the Kanji. Furthermore, say you are reading and you come across a word that you don't know. There are two cases - either you can guess the meaning of that word from the context, or you can't. I argue that it is better if the word you don't know is written in Hiragana. With Hiragana, you can simply type out that word and search for it, either verifying your guess, or learning what word it is. With Kanji, it is harder to search precisely: since you don't know how the word is pronounced from reading a Kanji you don't know, you can only search for 'your guessed meaning + kanji' and see if they are the same. If the sentence has multiple possible meanings, or your guess of the meaning was wrong, you are simply out of luck: Consider a sentence like \"X event occured, so Y person felt ___\". Without knowledge of Y's thoughts regarding X, any number of emotions could fill in the blank, and so searching by meaning isn't going to be effective.\n\n3. While Kanji may use fewer spaces/characters to express a word, it makes writing things more time consuming. Say you wanted to write Sunday. In Hiragana this is \u306b\u3061\u3088\u3046\u3073\u3001in Kanji this is \u65e5\u66dc\u65e5. While the Kanji is 3 characters rather than 5, the middle character which replaces \u3088\u3046 is a large number of strokes, it is faster to write the hiragana, and the tiny strokes in that Kanji make it difficult to write or read when you want your text to be small. \n\n\nDisclaimer: My argument isn't predicated on any hard statistics or linguistic background (I have never taken a linguistics class, don't have the room for one in my course plan), just on personal thoughts. However, if you do have input for the argument in the form of relevant statistics, or the perspective of someone studying linguistics, then I'd appreciate hearing it.

{"input": "CMV: The law should never be used as a moral compass + \n + First of all, the *law* I'm referring to isn't the law of any particular country, just laws in general.\n\nImagine sitting on the bus when an elderly woman comes in. The rules don't tell you to give up your seat for her, but you do.\n\nThis short scenario illustrates that rules and morals are two different things. However, I see more and more people defending actions saying it was \"legal\", and therefore it should be alright. \n\nThe death of Cecil the lion is an (extreme) example: the man who shot him defended himself by declaring that what he did was legal. As the global outrage over his actions showed us, it was however completely immoral.\n\nAnother example: bankers. I read in a book that bankers that are considered \"professional\" disregard their own morals as much as possible and instead try to do as much as is legally possible. Immoral bankers and brokers are a core part of why the 2008 crisis was able to happen.\n\nI think this illustrates what happens when people use the law as \"moral compass\": immoral behavior. \n\nSecondly, I think this is caused by the fact that our law is not our morals themselves but rather these morals applied into (simplified) rules.\n\nThirdly, I think it's impossible to enforce socially appropriate behavior like giving up your bus seat. This follows from my second viewpoint: because rules are simplified results of our morals, they can never cover every aspect of our lives, therefore leaving gaps for bus travellers and dentists and bankers to exploit.\n\n**I think it's up to us to be aware of this and never use the law as a moral compass.

{"input": "CMV: Sword Art Online is one of the best Anime of All Time [SPOILERS] + \n + I've recently subscribed to r/anime, and as a long time anime watcher and considering myself to have the appropriate amount of good taste, I feel that Sword Art Online is massively misrepresented as mediocre among fellow fans and otakus. Currently ranked [#459 on MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online), this show scores an average rating of only 8 out of 10 nerd points.\n\nI believe this is due primarily to *hater votes*. It should be in the top 50, if not top 25, anime of all time.\n\nIn fairness to the haters, the ALO arcs sort of ruined it with the whole sister romance harem thing. Japanese people are weird, but they sure know how to milk a hit show. For that reason, SAO II is not considered here; just vanilla SAO please!\n\nSome Background\n\n---\n\nI am a 30-year old male product writer for the web, and I am not what most would consider an otaku or weeabo. (I prefer Korean culture, if we're comparing asking, and I don't go to cons, collect or read much Manga, or follow every anime series.) I watch anime recreationally, and consider myself a reasonable self-styled critic. I've recently watched quite a number of shows, being bored at home, and I've watched and rewatched SAO several times and am familiar with it.\n\n\n---\n\n**Why The Show Is Good**\n\nCharacters: The cast is great. Voice acting isn't overdone or underdone, and the characters all feel like people from a real world stuck in a game for a long time together. It also makes sense that they're all there.\n\nPlot: The premise is not made of solid gold, but it's interesting enough to lend itself to greatness. If you die in the game, you die for real no quitsies. This has been done before in fiction, of course. However, SAO takes a different treatment of this premise. Normally, you would see horror, like in a show like Gantz, applied, or game aspects, such as in No Game No Life. \n\nSAO's goal is rather to show that a virtual world can be real and fulfilling. Its creators accomplish this by focusing not on the MMO aspects, which are limited to flavor, but rather on the interaction between strong characters and the tension of being trapped within this scary world. The story itself lends itself to a rich world, and the writers take advantage of the larger arc to fit in almost a dozen sub-arcs in 24 episodes. The show is *very* story dense for an anime; normally, a single sub-arc would take 4-6 episodes. These sub-arcs balance developing the world, fighting, and building relationships. The characters build on their strengths and flaws and often find themselves in situations partially crafted of their own making. (Example; Asuna is hard on her guild and pushy, and this results in a poor culture within the guild that causes problems as the series develops.) There are no unbelievable moments.\n\nIn the end, the heroes triumph, but it's not a boring triumph. They often sacrifice during the show and make many mistakes that weigh upon them. At the ending bar scene, you can feel the air of both relief and regret washing over all of the former players.\n\nAt the symbolic level, SAO is very symbolic of life itself. God puts us on this plant, and we don't get to leave unless we die. So we adapt to it and live in it, the same as in SAO's virtual world. This allegoric story pairs well with the show's many slice-of-life scenes, creating a very vibrant and real-seeming virtual world.\n\n**Writing:** SAO does not waste time or words. No episode is filler, and each main character is multi-dimensional and arrives naturally in the main story arc. Characters do not break character. Villains are villains. Episodes are succinct and *excellently paced.* This show is so clean that you can eat off of it.\n\n**Art:** The art direction is superb. Each character's outfit is suitable for their personality and status. Motion and combat is more fluid and direct as well as it was in Fate: UBW and other highly regarded similar shows. It was smoother than classic epics like Record of Lodoss War and Gurren Lagann or modern releases like Arslan. Admittedly, it probably had a bigger budget than those shows, but that shouldn't be a detracting factor at all. The only *fantasy world* anime I would give a higher regard to in art direction is Berserk, but in quality of animation, SAO crushes Berserk.\n\nThe only complaint you could make in the art department is that the show wasn't stylized enough to differentiate it from other fantasy anime.  For instance, the art direction in Kill la Kill was an incredible thematic rush of color with awesome hand-painted backgrounds. I'll grant that point, but can you name a fantasy anime with a better quality of animation offhand?\n\n**Avoids Most Awful Anime Pitfalls:** Fanservice, chibi conversations, people falling off of park benches or turning into paper; these are the marks of an anime breaking the fourth wall and ruining suspension of disbelief for the view. In short, they're signs that an anime doesn't take itself seriously. Almost no anime of any level of notoriety, excluding comedies, uses these generic tactics.\n\n---\n\n**Arguments Against**\n\n\nThe story follows Kirito, a regular guy with some Kendo training and beta test experience in an online game. Kirito earns almost all of his levels solo and is on par with the very best fighters in the game. He starts off with an advantage due to his experience, gets full exp. for the very first boss, and grinds pretty much every day from there on out to stay on top of the curve. He clearly earns his main character slot through a number of trials instead of being handed it by the divine will of the writers, such as in every other anime ever. He is given a unique skill, eventually, which is powerful, but it's relatively balanced because it's difficult to use. His backstory and skillset are reasonable, and given that there must be a \"best\" among all the players, it makes sense that the show would follow him.\n\nMeanwhile, in How to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon, the main character is literally given a skill that says \"become overpowered against things you can't beat.\" It's shit like that which makes me want to throw my laptop.\n\n\nIn the first or second episode, another beta tester dies in Kirito's arms not because he was defeated, but because he turned down a potion. That guy was obviously a fuckin' idiot, and that scene could have been saved if he had just drank up and laid there. This is a fair criticism. Additionally, the army guild unit that marches in to fight the minotaur boss half dead is also made of retards. However, it's noted in the show that the reason they do this is because the army has been terrorizing its members. However, those deaths serve a purpose within the show and are not overtly distracting. The dumb beta guy's death serves to inspire Kirito to action and turns him into the MC. The dumb army guys are, much like the group that runs into the trap room early in the series, there to set Kirito on the right path and force him into action.\n\nIn the meantime, how will you excuse characters like Faye Valentine in one of your favorite anime, Cowboy Bebop? She's just there to be a plot instigator with a pair of giant boobs. Almost. Entirely. Fanservice. Many other very good anime have done much much worse with their cast and still rank top 50. Hell, Hajime no Ippo is fan ranked 20 on MAL, and although I won't disagree that the show is awesome, it's just following the formula of a hundred other sports anime shows like Prince of Tennis. OWARI NO SERAPH is even up there, and that show literally only has one redeeming character -- who isn't in most episodes. Hell, characters are invented out of thin air and people do dumb shit in Game of Thrones every other episode. Are you really going to say that SAO's weak point is a few serviceable plot blunders and side characters that didn't think through some obvious mistakes?\n\n\nThe ending probably irked a few of people because it was so sudden. However, that's really the magic of the series. It's a virtual world controlled by a nutty, manipulative scientist-god whose purposes are unknown. That's the driving mystery behind every episode. Why are they even there? Why is the NPC planted in the guild as the final boss? Why is the psychologist AI disabled?\n\nWithout that underlying tension, the series doesn't take shape. The story is about human actors making intense decisions, and the elusive creator adds another layer to the conflict. It makes the story feel bigger than it is and every victory seem hollow. This in turn allows our main characters to keep driving forward.\n\nPlus, they've already put in so many boss fights. I thought the defeat of the technically invincible guild leader was an awesome way to end, although it's obviously hedging a sequel.\n\nI'm tired of typing, so I won't bore you with more examples. Although I really wish they had done much more with the sequels, I believe the original series ranks among the best-produced, best scripted, cleanest, most heartfelt Anime of all time. I look forward to your spirited replies.\n\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: A benefit of believing in subjective morality is that it forces you to really think about why something would be \"good\" or \"bad\". + \n +  My position is that if someone believes there are things that are objectively good or bad then they may fall into a mindset of simply accepting things as good or bad without much thought. This can lead them into blindly following their so called objective morals. On the other hand if they don't believe that there are things that are objectively good or bad, then they will more often try to think through why something could be \"good\" or \"bad\". This in turn can make the person more aware of little details and nuances that may cause a big change in their way of seeing a situation. This can allow a more flexible outlook of the world. This will prevent the blind acceptance of ideas of what is good and what is bad.\n\nNote: when I use good and bad in quotations it's because I understand that a component of subjective morality is that it takes the position that nothing is inherently good or bad, but I don't know what would be more appropriate words to use.\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.
