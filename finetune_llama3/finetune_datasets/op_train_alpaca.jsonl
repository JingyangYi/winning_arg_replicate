Dogs do not have the same urge to 'start a family', nor do they have the emotional desire to have children. They aren't going to feel 'left out' because everyone else is having babies and they are not, that's silly. \n- Owners who claim they 'keep an eye on their pet enough to make sure they aren't having sex' are naive and are not accounting for the very real possibility that a trip to the dog park and a 10 minute distraction (like a telephone call) can end in pregnancy. \n- Keeping a pet intact and not allowing it to mate is a different form of cruel in my opinion.

It is the responsibility of every able-bodied individual to defend themselves from any attack, sexual or otherwise. Identifying the circumstances in which women are most often sexually assaulted and teaching young women how to recognize those circumstances and be aware of or avoid them is completely reasonable, and in no way \"blames the victim.\" Teaching girls not to put themselves in unsafe situations is not the same as telling girls who get raped that it's their fault. \n\n\nI can assure you, any boy in the care of responsible parents is being taught that rape isn't ok. To say \"we should be teaching boys not to rape\" completely ignores the fact that well-mannered, considerate people *aren't committing rapes.* Rape is an attack like any other, and anyone who attacks another person outside of self defense is acting on motivation that can not be educated against. \n\n\nWhich leads me to my next point...\n\n2.

{"input": "I am a compatibilist in the free will debate. This means that I believe in universal determinism and free will simultaneously. In fact, I believe determinism is necessary for free will. CMV. + \n + I am a compatibilist in the free will debate. This means that I believe in the truth of universal determinism, but I still believe in free will. These are compatible phenomena.\n\nMany of my reasons for being a compatibilist are outlined by Daniel Dennett in his book, *Freedom Evolves*. If you haven't read the book, the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_Room_\\(book\\)#Synopsis) has a decent summary of many of the ideas covered by Dennett. I considered myself a [hard determinist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_determinism) until I read *Freedom Evolves*.\n\nThe problem I originally had with compatibilism is that it allows our status of having \"free will\" to change depending on situations external to us, which seems to say nothing whatsoever about our wills.\n\nIt just didn't seem *good* enough to say that we have free will, yet concede in the words of Arthur Schopenhauer, [\"A man can do what he wills but not will what he wills\"](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer#Quotes). In what sense would the \"will\" really be free?\n\nI have since come to change my position on free will. I believe that human beings have it even if determinism is universally true. I believe that determinism is necessary for free will, in fact, ~~and I also believe that free will is something that we can say we really have even if we're not interested in moral responsibility, i.e., I'm not just confirming free will as a means of making sense of moral responsibility.~~\n\nHere are my reasons for being a compatibilist, and for believing that determinism is necessary for free will:\n\n**(I) Control is the type of free will worth wanting.**\n\nDennett's example is quite good in my opinion. He writes about a pilot who not only has direct, \"first-order\" (if you will) control over his plane, but also a special sort of foresight and control that allows him to direct the plane into places where *he will best retain control of it*. This higher-order control means that we are capable of responding to our environment with courses of action that have been planned rationally. We have the kind of free will worth wanting even if we \"cannot do otherwise\" in a metaphysical sense.\n\n**(II) Indeterminacy and free will make no sense together.**\n\nThere are a few points I could make here. The first is that if indeterminacy does not give us free will based on the fact that if \"choices\" are non-deterministic, then deliberation does not necessarily bring us any closer to a decision.\n\nI could weight the factors of two of my options (consciously or otherwise, whatever you consider meaningful deliberation to be in terms of getting closer to a decision) and if my deliberation is really to be called \"deliberation\", then it should be made more likely that I will choose one option and less likely that I will choose the other. But having indeterminacy involved would mean that my deliberation may actually mean nothing with regard to my decision.\n\nFeeling as though we have free will is a prerequisite to actually having it. I find this point sort of self-explanatory but rather important to mention here. The \"feeling\" that we have free will *is* the same as deliberation, and so deliberation must mean something with regard to the actual decision we make. Here is an example:\n\n\n\n\nThis is the main problem I have with libertarian free will. They have to find a way to explain how indeterminacy gives us free will, and they simply can't.\n\n**(III) Libertarian philosophers confuse determinism with fatalism.**\n\nOne libertarian author I read (Helen Steward, *A Metaphysics for Freedom*) argued that if determinism is true, then there is no such thing as an \"action\". She claimed that if everything is determined, then no conscious creature would ever have a reason to interfere and \"settle a matter\" in order to steer it away from it's determined path. This is, needless to say, a blatant confusion of determinism with [fatalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism).\n\n**(IV) We are only moved to act by reason and desires.**\n\nReason and desires are not things that are up to us. They are this way by definition, I believe. Deciding what we want is a useless idea. In order to decide what we want, we would have to consult ourselves to see what we want to decide we want first. The nature of real wanting is that is a realization about the self.\n\nReason and beliefs are the same way, in that if we actually believe anything, even if the belief arose from some action in our past, *that* action was done because of a prior belief, and we will eventually reach a point where we have to say that one's predispositions to act were based on something that was not up to the agent himself.\n\n**(V) Hard determinists are making unreasonable demands.**\n\nThey want to know how it is that we can \"will our own wills\". But willing our own wills does not make sense and so there is no way to tell whether it is a desirable form of free will. If determinism is universal, then it is kind of moot to say that it impinges upon free will. It's kind of like claiming that behavior is not true behavior because it relies on environments and genetics... which is everything that *could* determine behavior anyway and effects us all equally anyway, which renders the whole point moot. Humans have more free will than cats because we can control our responses to circumstances more rationally, with more \"higher order control\". Willing our own wills is nonsensical and the idea is not relevant.\n\n**TL;DR** ... I am a compatibilist. I believe that free will and determinism are not only compatible, but that determinism is necessary for free will because libertarian arguments for indeterminacy and free will are not cogent. Many of the reasons I have for being a compatibilist are expressed very well in [Elbow Room](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_Room_\\(book\\)) by Daniel Dennett. I believe that hard determinists are demanding something impossible from compatibilists when they ask how it is that we can \"will our own wills\".\" Willing one's own will doesn't not make sense, but we have a form of higher-order control available to us that allows us to respond to our environments with rational courses of action, and it is determinism (not fatalism) that allows us to be driven from concrete reasons and desires into action. We have, in Dennett's words, \"the only type of free will worth wanting.\"\n\nCMV.\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: Welfare you receive isn't \"your money\", and things like food stamps that make welfare non-discretionary are a good idea. + \n + A social safety net is a good idea, and money is spent with the intent of providing a specific kind of help. In many places this includes a cash handout. I believe this is wrong on many levels. \n\n* The money may be misspent. This idea is NOT based on the assumption that poor people are all stupid or drug addicts. It's simply the fact that there's no way of ensuring that the cash is used for its intended purpose. The best assumption you can make is that people would be so desperately craving the thing you give them extra money for that they would almost certainly spend it on that, but people may end up endure forms of squalor that were far from what the well intentioned policy makers had in mind. \n\n* From the government's perspective, money is also being spent inefficiently. Let's say a program wanted to ensure that people were well fed. They'd have to find a cash amount that would buy enough healthy food to feed the recipients, but people have different needs, so they'll have to provide to the upper percentile of demand (the alternative is weighing people, paying women less etc.) This not only will result in discretionary income, but inequality in how much everyone gets. A food stamp system would allow everyone to get as much food as they need, and the money left over is still in the governments hands to spend on other initiatives.\n\n* Things like food stamps are patronising, and that's a good thing. A cash handout creates a sense of entitlement beyond what something \"patronising\" like food stamps, rent vouchers etc. create. By the time money's in your pocket or bank account, there's several layers between you and the people providing that service. Food stamps create a meaningful difference between working poor and welfare recipients to encourage escaping the system. There's also the huge benefit of less resentment of those on welfare.\n\n* In general they communicate purpose more clearly. Too often there's an attitude of getting as much money as you can from the government, and paying as little tax as possible. It seems like people would be less likely to trick their way into receiving food stamps, education and other initiatives purpose built to meet needs. On the other side, I would think policies would allow people to see their taxes as less of a redistribution of wealth, and more as funding for benevolent programs to create a better society.\n\nI think as much welfare as possible should be in the form of vouchers and other purpose specific, non discretionary forms. I like food stamps, I like rent vouchers, I like free healthcare and education. Things like these over cash seem like the best way to prevent the safety net becoming a fishing net. I can't think of many situations where cash is the best option, which is why I'm here.\n\nThe other aspect to this changemyview is that I'm ok with policies that \"patronise\" the less fortunate. Being well fed, healthy, comfortably sheltered, continually educated to eventually earn the life you want are more important than not being insulted.

{"input": "I believe falsification is an inadequate demarcation criterion. CMV + \n + For the uninitiated, in the philosophy of science the demarcation problem considers how to distinguish science from non-science. Karl Popper, a 20th century philosopher, suggested that the line separating a scientific theory from a non-scientific theory is whether or not a theory is falsifiable. He also suggested that falsified theories be rejected for newer, unfalsified but falsifiable theories. I think this is inadequate, and that a theory should be measured by its successes rather than its failures.\n\nI believe this for two reasons. First, I believe that the way science is actually practiced should be taken into consideration when discussing the demarcation problem. I believe that this is by evaluating the successes of the theory rather than judging it based on a falsification criterion. Secondly, I believe that the falsificationism principle cannot keep up with where science is taking us. \n\nConsider the first point. When factual evidence is uncovered that undermines a well-established theory it is often rejected outright. If it is not rejected, the theory is modified slightly to accommodate the new facts. Therefore, the theory stands on its previous successes rather than succumbs to falsification attempts. This is not to say an established theory is never replaced or superseded, but I do think this demonstrates that too much import is placed on falsification, when in reality science is hardly ever practiced this way. Most science is done within the scope of a theory. I would argue that a really well established theory is in practice unfalsifiable. It can only be amended or superseded.\n\nSo how is a scientific theory established anyhow? By its successes! You can argue that this is semantic -- that any success of a scientific theory is its passing a falsification test, but in practice I think that scientists pay a lot more attention to how successful predictions of a theory have been rather than to what degree it has failed falsification tests. These are not one and the same! Consider how general relativity was established. It predicted a few major things that distinguished it from competing theories such as the precessing perihelion of mercury and the deflection of starlight during an eclipse. When Arthur Eddington established that starlight did indeed bend during an eclipse, the theory gained widespread support. Forget the fact that there was much that remained to be tested. It was the successes that gained it support.\n\nFinally, I think that falsificationism leaves little to no room for inductive reasoning. I think that this has historically been very important in science, such as in the discovery of relativity, and I think that it's importance is only growing. There is plenty of science that can't pragmatically be falsified because of technological or temporal constraints. Consider the question of quantum gravity. Because of technological limitations, theories of quantum gravity will be untestable for the foreseeable future. If falsificationism had its way, those studying the quatum gravity problem from a theoretical perspective would be on par with priests and mystics. So what separates String theory (a theory of quantum gravity) from religion? Its success, of course! It is the only theory, per my knowledge, that can definitely combine quantum mechanics and general relativity in a logically consistent way. Whether or not the theory is correct remains to be seen, but because of its success its status should be squarely in the domain of science.\n\nThese are my views, anyway.

The assumptions that I think are implicit in this are first, that WWII was fought to end The Holocaust, and second, the common thought that if something on the scale of The Holocaust were happening right now the world would unite to stop it.\n \nThe United States has a horrible, shameful history of ignoring genocide (so does the world, in fact, but as an American and given my background, I'm only really qualified to speak on its history). \n\nThere's a lot of good sources talking about US response to The Holocaust. Here are some [1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_American_foreign_policy#The_Holocaust) [2](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/14/specials/onefifty/20FRAN.html) [3](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005182). The short of it is that Roosevelt knew that The Holocaust was happening and not only didn't take any action, but he worked to keep anyone else from taking action, meanwhile, Jewish refugees hoping to escape to the US were forced to turn back and return to Germany. When an eyewitness of a Polish death camp eventually met with Roosevelt, the president didn't ask a single question about the Jews but did ask how the horses in Poland were doing. The blame isn't just on the government: even news agencies didn't report the information they knew about The Holocaust or intentionally made it a short, buried blurb. Whenever any news agency did prominently cover news of The Holocaust, the US government outright denied it was true.\n \nThere's a few different reasons why this happened, but the most prominent is that the US simply didn't want to intervene. They didn't want to get dragged into a war even to save the lives of many millions of innocent civilians.\n \nAfter WWII the UN was formed and adopted the [Genocide Convention of 1948](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide_Convention), which [146 nations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_parties_to_the_Genocide_Convention) are now parties to. It was drafted to insure that nothing like The Holocaust happens again, and all 146 signatories are *mandated* to intervene, by use of military force if necessary, if they know of genocide having been committed, of a conspiracy or attempt or incitement to commit genocide, or even of complicity with genocide having occurred.\n \nAs you all know, there have been many genocides since then. Putting the focus on Rwanda for just a moment, where in 1994 about one million ethnic minorities were killed in the streets, most often with machetes, after a planned genocide was incited on the nation's (mostly Catholic) radio stations.\n\nHere's how the US responded:\n\n* They knew there was going to be a genocide and exactly who was going to be leading it. They actually *spoke* to those people and tried to convince them not to commit the genocide, but took no action once they said no.\n\n* The US refused to jam the radio broadcasts inciting the genocide, which it easily had the power to do, citing **cost** as the reason for their inaction.\n \n* Once the UN actually did begin to intervene in the genocide, the US lobbied for a total withdrawal of UN troops.\n \n* And most cowardly: Secretary of State Warren Christopher forbade anyone working for the government to *say* the word \"genocide\", because admitting that a million ethnic minorities being chopped up with machetes in the streets was genocide would mean that the Genocide Convention would require them to intervene. \n\n(Sources: [1](http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB53/index.html) [2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_Genocide#United_States) )\n \nEven now, atrocities are being committed and ignored all over the world. The most widely and willingly ignored atrocities, in my opinion, are those taking place in [North Korea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_north_korea). Right this very moment, in 2014, as you read this, there are *at the very least* 150,000 innocent people being tortured and killed in concentration camps in North Korea. If you want to be horrified, read accounts and see the drawings of the concentration camps from escaped prisoners and former guards ([1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoeryong_concentration_camp) [2](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/life-north-korean-labor-camp-no-thinking-just-fear-n32076) [3](https://www.google.com/search?q=north+korea+concentration+camps&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eHjZU-LDLMK6igKzp4GwCg&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643#imgdii=_) [4](http://freekorea.us/camps/)). And that's not even mentioning the horrific living conditions that all North Koreans have been subjected to by their leadership for decades, which has taken the lives of many many millions of North Koreans.\n \nIran has prisons with the specific purpose of raping and torturing women who are imprisoned there ([1](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/world-jan-june11-iranianwomen_06-10/) [2](http://www.iranhrdc.org/english/publications/reports/3401-surviving-rape-in-iran-s-prisons.html) [3](http://www.mrctv.org/videos/testimony-iranian-woman-tortured-and-raped-evin-prison-iran)). Meanwhile, Iran's [state-sponsored](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funding_of_Hezbollah) terrorist group [Hezbollah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah) is just one of countless religious-extremist trying to wage war against the world and uses nuclear mushroom clouds as images during their rallies ([1](http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/05/christopher-hitchens200905?printable=true&amp;currentPage=all) [2](http://city-journal.org/2009/eon0408jk.html)) at the same time that Iran is undeniably working towards [acquiring nuclear weapons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction).\n \nBack to the idea of a \"just war.\" The US has almost never entered a conflict for moral reasons, even when they had plenty available to them. I think that too many people naively think, \"Well, if something like The Holocaust were to happen again, of course we would do something about it.\" More often than not this leads them to rationalize in reverse that because we aren't intervening, things must not be all that bad in the more horrific parts of the world.\n\nThe second justification in a \"just war\" is usually in self-defense. While it's true that civilians in the US and other major western powers aren't being attacked *in the same scale* as the civilians of smaller or less fortunate nations (though let's not forget that there have been and continue to be many attacks against against western civilians), I don't see how a political border is enough to separate a civilian in another nation, especially one who stands for the same principles and ideals that I do, should be so much more categorically different from me than another person in my country who I despise.\n \nThe poet John Donne wrote an [amazing commentary](http://www.online-literature.com/donne/409/) on this, which you've all heard referenced in some way, as he was sick near death in the 1600s in a monastery where a bell would toll to signal to the priests that one of the sick was about to die and needed to have prayers said for them as they died. He noted that he might be so sick, without realizing it, that he was the person that the bell was tolling for. He then goes on to realize that it doesn't ultimately make a difference: \"No man is an island unto himself.\" He was a part of the whole of humanity, and just like any European nation being sunken into the sea makes Europe lesser, any loss of life directly concerned him because it was a loss for the humanity he was a part of. He wrote:\n \n\nI don't see how there's any consolation at all to be taken in knowing that it's only your fellow human beings somewhere else being tortured and killed. Let's even say none of these nations were openly hostile towards other nations, particularly those in the West (which almost all of them are). Let's say that if we just let them be, nothing bad would ever happen to us, only to their own people.\n \nDon't basic international human rights mean **anything**? Are we, who take so much pride in our civil rights and sense of justice utterly unwilling to make sacrifices for our fellow humans, our brothers and sisters, who just happened to have the misfortune of being born inside the wrong political lines without the means to escape? Is there **nothing** that we **won't** allow someone to do to innocent human beings?\n\nIf World War III were to start tomorrow, almost everyone would already know which country is on which side. On top of that, the Russia/North Korea/Iran/and so on side of the conflict seems to be doing a disproportionate amount of escalating global conflicts.\n \nGeorge Orwell, my favorite author and someone whose essays I *seriously* recommend to everyone, wrote in an essay on Gandhi:\n\n\nAnd he's been right so far given that horrible atrocities are being committed by small, weak nations that we could easily stop if it weren't for their political ties to stronger military powers and our unwillingness to start a war.\n\nI understand that war is horrible and, hell, I'm a healthy male of fighting age and probably wouldn't fare well if an world war broke out. I want it to be avoided in any way possible, which is why I'm hoping someone here will be willing and able to change my view and help me see a solution to these problems that would allow us defend basic human rights globally in a genuinely effective way and without resorting to war. Maybe I'm fundamentally wrong in thinking the winning a conflict against the aggressors in these atrocities would have any impact in keeping them from continuing; I don't think I am.\n \nBut if this war is going to be fought anyway, if it's going to break out no matter what we do and come after us, I would be ashamed if our involvement in it came only after trying to run away and let the other side do whatever it wanted until we were cornered and had no choice but to fight back, instead of us taking a stand against it to begin with, on behalf of basic human rights.\n \nMy view is that (1) WWIII looks like it might start anyway because of hostilities from a lot of the nations committing the atrocities in the first place, and if it's going to happen anyway we should take stand now instead trying to avoid it for as long as possible and letting millions of innocent people be tortured and slaughtered for nothing in the meantime.\n \nMy view is also that (2) even if WWIII isn't imminent, there *has* to be *some* point at which a government can commit an act *so horrible* that the global community would say \"We don't care if it means war, we're going to stop you.\" I think that line has already been crossed. If you agree with the principle but don't think the line has been crossed yet, please let me know what you think it should take.\n\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: Abortion should be mandatory if a fetus is found to have a handicap + \n + First of all, I would like to say that what the Nazis did with their eugenics was horrible. However, I believe this to be quite a different matter. The main difference being that the fetus has no feelings and will not suffer from its abortion. The reason that I wanted to discuss this, was the following tweet from a while back by Richard Dawkins:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/RichardDawkins/status/502106262088466432\n\nOh, how this man has a way with words. /s\n\n This was his response to one of his followers tweeting \"I honestly don't know what I would do if I were pregnant with a kid with Down Syndrome. Real ethical dilemma.\". I was surprised at this backlash. When I asked my friends, it turned out pretty much everybody was against forced abortion as well. After some research, it turns out that others who have proposed mandatory abortions of fetusses with Down syndrome have also received gigantic backlash (even being thrown out of their political parties).\n\nStill, I would like to change this view, because my feelings tell me that this is absolutely horrible and I therefore do not want to want this.\n\nNow my reasons for believing this:\n\n-Handicapped people will, on average, cost society more money than the average person/contribute less to society.\n\n-Somewhat related to the previous point: the parents could, to put it as bluntly as Dawkins himself, 'try again' and this time, they will most likely have a child without birth defects or some other kind of handicap.\n\n-The child will cause the people around them a lot of stress, more than a normal child. Stress that could be avoided and should therefore be avoided.\n\nThe two main arguments against my point of view, I think, would be:\n\n-Slippery slope: What exactly would a handicap be? Who decides what defect is enough for a forced abortion, and what defect isn't? However, I don't think this means that we should simply avoid the whole issue altogether, merely because we can't define *exactly* what constitutes a handicap. As an example, the government also deals with handicapped people. They need to decide who is and who isn't handicapped (and who therefore deserves money to help them with their disability and privileges such as special parking spots). It is quite clear that Down syndrome and Huntington's disease have huge effects, not only on the child's parents and siblings, but also on all of society and of course on the child itself.. That would be enough to qualify as a handicap. Also. this argument sounds quite [fallacious](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope). There is quite a large difference between aborting fetusses diagnosed with Down syndrome and aborting all fetusses that will not have blue eyes and blond hair. The government also controls the army, but that doesn't mean they are just going to shoot everybody they don't like.\n\n-It can't be enforced: how could the government enforce this? The government could simply force all women to register their pregnancies and force them to have their fetusses tested for birth defects. Sure, this might lead to people hiding pregnancies, but just because it isn't a definitive solution doesn't mean that the law shouldn't be there. It will still cause many fetusses that would otherwise have been born with a handicap to be aborted. One could argue that this law would violate the rights of the woman to control her own body, however, that's what laws do. Should we not be sending people to prison, because people should have control over their own body?\n\n\n\n-What about people who would be able to compensate (pay) the difference? Would they then be allowed to have the child, whereas the poor would not be allowed to? This would be a very unfair law then.\n\n-If I condone forcing a woman to have her fetus aborted, I obviously condone violating some basic human rights. Why would I not condone murder of society's 'burdens' as well?\n\n-The government shouldn't be deciding how much stress people put on themselves.\n\n-Trauma of the parents.\n\n-A smaller gene pool causes the race to be less capable of adapting. (Good example: sickle cell causes horrible pain. If it had been eliminated from the gene pool, a massive malaria outbreak might have happened since sickle cell causes immunity against malaria)\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: Claiming that people are allowed to hold whatever religious views they want implies correctness is not important or valuable in society + \n + Over the last few decades, easy access to information has started to decimate mainstream religious views which have been accepted for thousands of years. Loud voices have emerged from that debate, stating that people should be allowed to believe whatever they want as long as it does not directly harm anyone.\n\nIt's my view that this position is incorrect for a number of reasons, and more harmful than the alternatives. There may in fact be more of a net benefit for people's spirituality, from education about our reality than by defending their right to stay wrong. Again, my issue is not with the people who hold the outdated views. The reality is that most adult humans reach adulthood already holding strong views, and won't switch away from them in most circumstances. If they have taken the time to debate with others and look at information regarding their world and tried to come to a rational conclusion, yet decide to still hold on to outdated views, there is not much that any human can do. \n\nDefending their right to stay wrong is definitely not a good course of action, as it directly promotes that correctness is not important or valuable in our society. This has far reaching implications in how our surroundings think, especially in how these hard-headed adults bring their children up.\n\nIf someone actively chooses to be incorrect in regards to how they see the world, the best thing we can do is try to educate them. The middle ground is ignoring them completely, hope their children use the Internet and seek out knowledge and that they aren't making decisions based on their worldview. **The worst case scenario is defending their right to believe whatever they want.** \n\nLet's take an example: Bob believes that God is real. He can't really define what God is, but thinking that someone is always watching him feels good. Rebecca tries to explain to him the history of religion, and how the belief in God came from not understanding nature and humans requiring a catch-all to explain things. She explains to him that we now know what the stars are, and that we are actually star material. She explains that praying feels good because introspection is important, and how although there is no \"thing\" watching over him, the beauty of life itself is way cooler anyways.\n\nBob thinks about it and decides that although those arguments might make scientific sense they don't make him any happier. Accepting one's place in the cosmos takes too much humility, and instead of working on that, Bob takes the intellectually lazy approach and just stays with good olde God. \n\nThe next best outcome is not Rebecca defending his right to hold incorrect views about the world. It's Rebecca not saying anything. **If someone defends that we're allowed to believe whatever we want all it does is promote intellectual laziness, and potentially encourages actually harmful views to materialize and propagate.**\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: The \"check your privilege\" phenomenon is not racist against white people; rather, it calls for an awareness of the cultural and historical reality in which we live. + \n + There was a lot of uproar this week about an article written by a Princeton student on the topic of \"checking one's privilege.\" The problem with this expression is that it means different things to everyone. Some people, including this Princeton student, interpret the phrase as meaning something along the lines of \"fuck you white boy, your opinion is made invalid by the advantages given to you by society.\" As such, that shining bastion of white America, Fox News, sprang to the defense of this kid, to proclaim that prejudice against the opinions of an individual based solely on skin color or gender is wrong, in any form. I certainly agree with that assertion, but \"checking one's privilege\" does not mean that one's opinions are void simply because one is caucasian, or a man, or Christian. Rather, my interpretation of \"checking my privilege\" is that it means to have an awareness of the political and historical reality that I was born into and have grown up in. Life experience is the means by which we evolve as people; our opinions, words, actions, and thoughts are all defined by our perception of ourselves and our place in the world. That perception is undeniably linked to the historical and political context in which we exist. When you are told to \"check your privilege,\" you are being told to open your eyes to the reality of your situation, to the way that society treats you, compared to how it treats others. In other words, realize that your experience is unique, and that the opinions of others are no more or less valuable than yours, regardless of social status. This concept makes white people uncomfortable, as we have rigged the societal system so effectively to our own benefit. They would prefer to ignore the advantages they have over others. As a result, \"checking one's privilege\" becomes an attack on the comfort of white america in the cozy little system of oppression it has created for itself. \n\nTL;DR: Checking your privilege doesn't mean that being white, or a guy, or straight, or whatever discredits your accomplishments and opinions, just that individuals should have an understanding of the reality in which they exist, and how that reality affects them and others.\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

If some powerful country is carrying out abusive foreign policy in your country, and it's military is incomparably superior to yours, are you going to fight a conventional war against them ? Of course not !\n\nIf you abuse people, they will fight back in whatever way they can. Since you leave no opportunity for a fair fight, you are essentially asking for a clandestine \"dirty\" war.

Both of them can be used to achieve similar total death tolls. Why is it worse for people to have been gassed to death than for them to die slowly with shrapnel stuck in their gut?\n\nThis also relates to international intervention. If we don't distinguish between the two types of warfare then there won't be international outcry over *chemical* warfare anymore, but rather on warfare as a whole, which could work to eliminate a negative stigma associated with this issue and could then lead to countries intervening more often in cases of domestic violence.\n\nOn an effect-level basis, both the types of warfare are similar once again. The usage of either types of weaponry will end in the death of people. Realizing this to be a necessary side-effect of warfare, how can we judge that the usage of chemical weapons will cause more pain/agony than conventional warfare when even bullets and shrapnel can lead to horrible situations like perforated lungs? Since we can't, it doesn't make much sense to draw a line between them.\n\nDrawing this line also seems to make conventional warfare look better than it is.

Let me explain....\n\nIf I am a taxpaying homeowner, and let's say I dislike Jews (to pick a random ethnic minority). As a homeowner, I have the right to refuse Jewish people into my home. My home is mine. The same should qualify for a business.\n\nLet's say the CEO of Wal-Mart (just to pick a random company) hates Jews. He hates them so much that he decides that he will not employ any Jewish people nor let them in the store. Why is it different for him to operate his business based on his own personal views and morals as it is for how he handles things at home?\n\nIf the CEO of Wal-Mart decided to do that, he would deal with some harsh consequences. For one, Jews would no longer shop at Wal-Mart. Many non-Jewish citizens would also stop shopping at Wal-Mart because they found that practice to be despicable. Many companies would stop doing business with Wal-Mart because of this practice. The companies that still did business with Wal-Mart would lose most of the same clientele that have stopped supporting Wal-Mart. Many other stores such as Target and K-Mart would thrive on making the public aware that they do not have the hateful policies that Wal-Mart has and would reach out to the customers alienated by Wal-Marts policy. Eventually, the CEO of Wal-Mart would decide to discontinue this practice. Why? Because the millions (or possibly billions) of lost revenue would convince him that having this practice is bad for business. I guarantee if Arizona had allowed their \"keep the gays away\" bill, that whichever businesses decided to exercise that right would lose substantial profits and their competitors would drive them out. \n\nWe saw this happen with Chic-fil-A. It came out that they were funding anti-gay groups, word got out, people protested and boycotted, and they eventually stopped giving to those groups. Did Dan Cathy have a sudden revelation that made him change his mind about gay people? No. He did it because it was in his economic interest. In a capitalist society, it is the responsibility of the consumer to support businesses you want to succeed based on your personal ethics. This is why I believe that anyone complaining about minimum wage but still shops at Wal-Mart or eats at McDonald's is a complete hypocrite. I personally do not buy gas from Exxon due to their treatment of the LGBT community. As a consumer, your purchasing power is your vote. Put it to use.\n\nIgnorant, hateful people have rights to their beliefs just as everyone else does. If someone opens up a discriminatory business, there is a chance that they might be able to stay afloat from the patronage of equally hateful citizens or perhaps citizens that are just apathetic, but it would be a small number, and accepting, non-discriminatory businesses would emerge to accommodate consumers that are more open minded. We saw a lot of right-wing Christians support Chic-fil-A's decisions, but eventually, the company gave in.\n\nI think if a white supremacist wanted to open a whites-only bar for fellow minded people to congregate then it should be his constitutional right. If a huge Dallas Cowboys fan wanted to open up a sports bar that is openly for the Cowboys and they didn't want any Redskins fans in the bar cheering for the other team, they should have the right to refuse them service. It's your business. Do what you want. \n\nJust as a secular government allows religious citizens, but does not make laws honoring religious beliefs. Our goal in a society should not be to force beliefs that are right, but instead learn to let all ideas co-exist no matter how despicable or hateful they may seem as long as they do not infringe on the rights of others.

This reality patently proves that the US talking about racial discrimination in the 21st century is nothing but a charade to hide its human rights abuses.\n\nThis is shameful; we can do better than this. It is quite natural for the world to censure the US as a major violator of human rights; it is completely disqualified to talk about human rights. Many countries in the world are now ridiculing the US, America should be going through an agony of shame; it's become a laughing stock of the world.

{"input": "CMV: I'm not a misogynist + \n + Serious attempt to understand the logic and come to a final conclusion here. Backstory: there's women that have been in my life over the past few years that have accused me of being a misogynist for a variety of reasons. I had a discussion today that resulted in me, again, being called a misogynist. As of right now I tend to assume it's just an insult that's being cast at me because I've \"won\" an argument, thus being used as an easy-out. However, what if it's true? If so, I should probably work on some self-improvement right?\n\nHere's why I think I *might* be a misogynist:\n\n* Let's just start by saying I absolutely despise the mother of my child as it seems to be a frequent reason I'm interpreted as a \"woman hater.\" It would be false to say that I haven't let my experiences with her have an affect on me, but it would also be false to say that because I hate her I must hate all women.\n\n* Second: perhaps what I would see as my closest-to-misogynistic trait. It's more difficult for women to gain my trust. This generally only applies to women who I'm considering a relationship with. Probably leads into my next point. However, I don't have a problem being friends with women or associating with them because how much do you *really* need to be able to trust a friend or associate? On that level, I think distrust everyone fairly equally. For that matter, I don't really try to get into relationships with men so... maybe I would distrust men in the same way? Not sure.\n\n* In all likelihood because of the above point I don't usually give two flying fucks about having sex or especially getting into a committed relationship that extends beyond dating.\n\n* On occasions outside of the above: I do from time to time partake in \"no strings\" or \"friends with benefits\" arrangements. I make my intentions clear from as early as possible, but when asked about escalating to a legitimate relationship I tend to back out of the arrangement and put an end to it. I see this as my best effort to not \"lead someone on\" or \"tie them down\" because clearly we don't share the same end-game. If I wanted a relationship that's what I would have aimed for from the beginning.\n\n* I have standards. The few times I have been in relationships my significant other has been attractive and, since the break-up with my son's mother, had some level of intelligence. I won't consider a relationship, even a no-strings one, with someone who is overweight or I perceive to be, for lack of a nicer way of saying it, an idiot.\n\n* My immediate reaction to someone announcing they are a feminist is a negative one. I'm not a fan of the MRM either, but that's mostly because of all of the whining and lack of motivation to actually accomplish anything. At least they acknowledge some of the same issues that affect my life. I feel like feminists as a group are actively fighting against what I am. Not saying I can't eventually respect a feminist or that I would suddenly dislike someone upon finding out that they are a feminist, but if part of my first impression of someone is that they are a feminist it's a red mark, so to speak. I realize they're not all bad, I really do, but my experiences with people who are willing to speak up and say they are a feminist (outside of Reddit) have *always* been bad ones.\n\n* I have put my hands on a woman once. A knife was involved. I've had two relationships where I was punched, kicked, bit, and verbally abused. One of them was, you guessed it, my son's mother. On no other occasion have I hurt a woman. (sex accidents excluded)\n\n\nThat being said, here's the main reasons I think I am NOT a misogynist:\n\n* I don't cheat out of respect for my partner, I would think this kind of mentality is the *opposite* of a misogynist. However, I'm told that the fact that I have zero tolerance or forgiveness for a cheating partner means I see them as an \"object that I own.\" Wtf?\n\n* I'm not controlling, one of many traits that probably led to the demise of the relationship between my son's mother and I. In spite of that, when I'm in a relationship I don't make it a point to \"lock down\" my significant other. Again, I'd think the fact that I don't see women as objects to be controlled is a pretty clear indication that I'm *not* a misogynist.\n\n* I'm respectful as fuck to women, especially compared to how I interact with other men. I make it a point to watch my mouth more and I'm *much* more likely to shrug off an offensive comment. \n\nI'm more than willing to honestly answer any questions if more clarification is needed, and if I get no responses I'm going to be sure to use an empty thread as a reference the next time one of my female affiliates decides to call me a misogynist. I say I'm not, CMV.\n\n\nI had never considered the fact that misogyny was anything beyond *hating* women given the context in which it's typically used. I do have some misogynistic tendencies: the prime one, ironically, being something I listed as something that I thought was the complete opposite of misogyny. Fuck me, right? Anyways, I've also been made well-aware of the fact that my presentation could use some work. I don't honestly know if I'll ever be able to \"lift the veil\" any faster with women than I can with men, but I'll work on it.

CMV + \n + I feel most music since I have been alive (1993) just has not been on par with anything made before. It seems like starting around 1990 there was a sizable dip in originality of music, and songs were churned out of over-hyped, over-sexualized artists. These songs lack originality in many ways that I have noticed:\n\n**Ear-pleasing guitar riffs have morphed into electronic beats**\n\nPart of this drop in the quality of music comes from this. In today's music, instead of having a writer who understands music theory, one just needs a computer, a program or two, and a singer who appeals to the broadest demographic. There is no talent involved in creating music anymore. To further on the topic of writing...\n\n**Writing quality has diminished**\n\nWhat happened to writing a song about something that has happened to you, or made an impact on you or someone important to you?

Today, music is all about sex, drugs, money, cars, etc. And it's not to say it wasn't in what I like to call \"The Golden Era\" (dates in title) as well, but it sure feels to me those had more substance and meaning.\n\nI'm going to take an artist as an example here and use Taylor Swift. I don't know what your opinion is of her, but like most I encounter, it seems to be either you like her or you don't. What can't be argued is the fact that she wrote or co-wrote every song she has released. Not to add that she can play an instrument (guitar). I'm looking at you, Katy Perry. However, it seems to me the side of not liking Swift is ever-growing, even as her songs and writing continue to grow and evolve. (Yes, I'm a fan.)

It is a resource shared by all, and to endanger its balance is to harm every member of our species by recklessly damaging a critical shared resource.

Poachers clearly act against this interest, even going as far as to kill game wardens who get in their way.\n\nWhen current measures to save critically endangered species is on a brink of failure, it should be allowed for an international militia formed by volunteer fighters to take up arms against poachers who seek to personally gain by unjustly taking away from this shared resource.

{"input": "CMV: Automation will not be a problem in the future + \n + \nLet my clarify my point; I am not a believer in the notion that one day robots will be doing all the jobs and responsibilities required within the workforce while we, the humans, struggle to find a job. Instead, I simply don\u2019t believe that automation will take off on the widespread scale that some people are speculating. In this Youtube video [Humans Need Not Apply]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU) the narrator believes that all jobs, not just simple manufacturing jobs, will be replaced by robots. He relates our perils to that of the early 20th century horse that was replaced by the automobile. But I think this comparison is crude and does not take into the account of economics. \n\nLet\u2019s say his vision comes to fruition and the people with unskilled jobs are given the boot. And for the sake of generalization, let\u2019s also assume that the number of people receiving minimum wage is roughly similar to the number of unskilled laborers in the US (if you don\u2019t agree with this generalization I apologize). According the 2011 study from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, [73.9 million people]( http://www.bls.gov/cps/minwage2011.htm) work for minimum wage salary which represents almost 3/5 the number of salaried workers in the US. So back to the matter at hand. Let\u2019s say that they are let go from their jobs due to the fact that automation would be cheaper for business owners. We now have roughly 74 million people out of jobs. Yup, I\u2019d say that would put us in the very least a recession, or possibly a depression. These 74 million people would be unable to acquire the skills necessary to be hirable in the dwindling workforce due to a lack of money to receive an education.\n\nSo now let\u2019s assume that these 74 million people without jobs will go into a super saving mode in order to be able to buy food and keep whatever shelter they have over their heads. I don\u2019t think the government will be able to provide substantial welfare to almost half of the work force. According to [Labor Market Information]( http://www.dlt.ri.gov/lmi/laus/us/usadj.htm) the workforce in August of 2011 was 153,724 Americans and the workforce in July of 2014 was 156,023 people. Pretty similar numbers, so let\u2019s stick with 2011 since that\u2019s the date of the BLS study. If we add the current unemployed with the newly unemployed due to automation and divide that number by the labor force (73.9+13.8)/153.72 we would get an unemployment rate of 57%. Yikes I doubt the economy is doing great right now with almost 60% of the population unemployed. Even if the robots are cheaper and banging out products day in and day out, who is going to buy the merchandise? The United States GDP would be in crumbles! Businesses would go out of business due to a lack of cash flow and even more people would be unemployed. It would be a nasty cycle that would keep pushing more and more people out of jobs and onto the streets.\n\nNow, I think that the only way this level of automation would work is if our society converted into completely socialist society and shared the wealth and products of the robots equally. But I simply don\u2019t see that happening. It would be possibly the largest undertaking by the Government ever to create a working and efficient socialist system based purely on handouts. Plus I can\u2019t ever see the government allowing automation to take away the jobs of so many Americans. When Tesla began to put pressure on regular auto dealers because of their superior product, New Jersey, Texas, Colorado, Arizona, and Virginia all prohibited the sale of Tesla\u2019s in their states. If those states will go to those measures to protect car dealers, I would bet money that the Federal Government would do a good deal to protect the jobs of 60% of the workforce.\n\nI simply don\u2019t think that automation will change our lives as radically as the folks at /r/futurology would like you to believe. Sure, automation will come into effect in the future, but I don\u2019t think that it will be the problem that some have been making it out to be.

{"input": "CMV: Midget wrestling is more morally repugnant than cock fighting. + \n + This morning I received a snapchat video, from last night at a frequented college bar, of my buddy watching midget wrestling. A huge crowd was drawn to witness this spectacle. I don't know if the wrestling was real or for show but it seemed quite evident by the large crowd around a probably smaller than regulation size ring that a large number of people were willing to pay money to see midgets wrestle.\n\nIt seems silly saying this, but I have a visceral(visceral:emotion from instinct not intellect) feeling of disappointment and shamefulness knowing that people I associate with in society would want to watch fake or real wrestling of midgets. At the same time, I don't feel that way with cock fighting.\n\nTo sort this feeling out in my mind, I asked myself a series of questions: \nWhat are the differences between paying to watch midgets fight and paying to watch roosters fight? \nThe midgets fighting are largely unharmed, while roosters die. But what about the implicit statement made by paying to watch these acts? Are you willing to support the killing of a rooster for your personal enjoyment? Well, I'm willing to support the killing of chickens--I like meat. The volume of chickens I've ate is probably a greater volume of the roosters I'd have the opportunity to watch get killed even if I frequented cock fighting. (I've never watched cock fighting, by the way.)\n\nWhat statement would I implicitly be making by paying to watch midgets wrestle, then? Well, when I watch American football or basketball, I'm paying to watch a combination of skill and genetic luck--these athletes are quick, tall and well-trained. Skill doesn't seem to be the factor in drawing the crowd in the snapchat video, though. Besides being at a bar on a Thursday night, the reason people come is because it is funny--because it is degrading. I'd be paying to degrade the value humans give to other humans. \n\nWould I rather devalue humans or roosters? Roosters.\n\nCould devaluing roosters in turn devalue humans? Cock fighting could devalue humans respect of animals, could encourage greed through gambling, could encourage violence.\n\nCould there be any good in cock fighting? in midget wrestling? In this context, the bar was hosting a show and giving people a way to spend their Thursday night. Cock fighting could just as easily cater to a Thursday night. But cock fighting caters more to men and I know that men in the western world are worse at bonding with friends and have a higher suicide rate than women. I also know that one, women usually divorce men more often than vice versa and two, having friendship outside of your wife helps make you a happier and more interesting person for your wife.So my conclusion must be that men would lead happier lives and have a lower divorce rate if they participated in cock fighting. This sounds vague and absurd as a stand alone statement, but I really do believe male friendship is important to a functioning society and that male friendship is being lost. I'm not saying there aren't other avenues for male friendship--but at this point in my analysis, the idea that we can condone midget wrestling and not cock fighting still befuddles me.\n\nAfter those questions I came up with a thesis: Midget wrestling is more morally repugnant than cock fighting because midget wrestling normalizes making fun of other humans, cock fighting does not and it gives men a needed avenue for friendship.\n\nDisclaimer: I believe midgets prefer to be called little people. I apologize if my casual use of the word 'midgets' offends you personally. However, I'm interested in knowing what you think about this sort of wrestling, the movie the wolf of wall street and how you feel these events shape the perception of little people.\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

I will also go ahead and say that atheism *per se* is not a religion- it is the lack of belief in a god. I am referring to the \"new atheism\" movement, which is much more that just mere atheism. \n\nFirst off: **Something does not require belief in a deity in order to be considered religious.** Religion can manifest itself in many ways, such as a set of philosophies and beliefs among a group of people.\n\nI agree with Neil DeGrasse Tyson when he says that it's weird that the word \"atheist\" even exists. We don't go telling people we are nongolfers or that dogs are noncats. I get it, religion is a big thing and \"atheist\" describes someone who isn't apart of that.

I don't identify as a non-Muslim nor do I go to non-Muslim events in my city. \n\nSo, New atheism is a spiced up version of antitheism, and the attitude is displayed pretty accurately on /r/atheism. Just take a look at its [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Atheism).

This group holds events all the time. Rallies, conventions, and the like. These events can always been seen on the /r/atheism sidebar. Hell, in 2012, new atheism people held a [Reason Rally](http://reasonrally.org/) in Washington where they had a bunch of people speak about how rational and atheist they are and expressed their disdain for religion and especially Christianity. Speakers talked about how X and Y about religion is awful (and don't get me wrong, the anti-gay, anti-science stuff annoys me too), and they went on to talk about how much of an asshole the God of the Bible is. People rant about how much they hate something they don't even believe exists.\n\nI find this all really ridiculous. A huge movement of people so strongly identifying as something they are NOT. They are guided by these books written by these atheist public figures and, when they get together, hardly appear different from religious people- the content is just different, but it does seem pretty dogmatic at times being that it is so focused on religion or the lack thereof. Why do so many of these people so heavily identify as something they are not?\n\nAgain, I am nonreligious so this isn't out of disdain toward atheists.

It might seem hard first, but it's like taming the bicycle, once you've learned how to do it, it's the most obvious thing. Same goes for swimming and using the snorkeling gear which is needed for us to keep track of the game while we surface for air. Because of the use of the fins, it's really fast paced, and there is only a minute brake during matches for the teams to switch sides. You have to be fast and strong with a proper mass to score, but because of the breath hold aspect, you wont get far if there is no proper teamwork between the players. And there is no way to talk in the water so players have to make their own decisions how to follow the tactics you've agreed in previously. Regardless of the intensity, the risk of injuries are surprisingly low. Your cardio-vascular system improves, your core muscles get stronger, your legs will look like as if you've been biking with a pro Tour team geared by a secret medical lab. You aren't destroying your joints on concrete. Tackles are rough, but the water and the resistance make sure you don't have to worry about drooling too early because of an unlucky impact on the head by a ball or another player. But this is not the important part even, but the fun it gives to be able to move around freely in the 800 m3 \"field\" (space, rather), accomplish complex attacks with quick passes and slam the ball into the basket. Right now this is probably the most underappreciated and obscure sport ever, but thanks to the enthusiasm of the players, it's expanding and present in 27 countries.

{"input": "CMV: Abortion is justifiable, but most abortions are immoral + \n + Posting with a throwaway as my position manages to offend both sides of the spectrum.\n\nFor a long time I believed that abortion was immoral, but I eventually became convinced (based largely on utilitarian grounds) that abortion was permissible.\n\nSo why do I believe that most abortions are immoral? For an act to be moral doesn't just mean that it is permissible according to ethics, but you need to actually know that it is moral.\n\nMost people don't understand the issue well enough to know abortion is moral. In fact, most (or at least a large proportion of) people don't know much of anything. For example, only 51% of people don't believe that global warming is caused by human activity. Only [54% of people in the US believe in evolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution). 17% of registered voters believe [Obama is a Muslim](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/26/obama-muslim_n_1706522.html). Of those, a large percent probably only say that they believe in evolution or global warming because their friends do. If their friends said the opposite, then they'd probably think that the scientists were just making it up too.\n\nSo that's on scientific issues that are relatively clear cut. Philosophical issues are much more messy. What percentage of people (male and female) do you believe actually understand the issue and aren't just quoting whatever they've heard other people say?\n\nFrom the way that these discussions go, it seems to be very small. Lots of people identify viability as the point where a foetus deserves moral consideration, but they can't articulate a reason why theoretical ability of foetus to survive outside of a womb should be connected to metaphysical rights (indeed this is a weak argument philosophically).\n\nMany people try to construct a right of bodily autonomy, but the situations differ in the important respect that the mother knowing put themselves in a position where there was a risk of pregnancy. Because of this distinction, bodily autonomy doesn't work as a contradiction argument, only as an analogy to aid intuition.\n\nNow while there are strong, philosophically justified utilitarian grounds (and other more nuanced arguments within other moral frameworks), I would be surprised if more than 5% of the population could provide a logically coherent argument. To be clear, I'm sure that many of the people here can restructure these arguments to be much more logically coherent, except that isn't really the point here - the point is that most people are logically incoherent.\n\nObjection: Does any of this matter? If someone does something that is morally acceptable and they believe that it is morally acceptable, then aren't they in the clear?\n\nNot quite. Someone has to also take due diligence. Suppose someone (who believes in utilitarian ethics) is going to go back in time and kill Hitler. This will have a good result (it will save millions of lives) and they strongly believe this. But before they get a chance, they run into another timetraveller with an oracle machine that can tell them if their action is good or bad (perhaps another leader will take over who kills even more than Hitler). If they choose to put their hands in their ears and not listen to the oracle, their act to kill Hitler cannot be considered moral because they were gambling with millions of lives by changing the course of world history and ignoring evidence that might have shown it disastrous. This applies even if the result is that they save millions of lives. The point is that for an action to be moral it isn't sufficient for it to be morally acceptable and for the person to believe that it is morally acceptable, but one needs to also take an appropriate level of care when coming to that decision.\n\nIn the same way, human life is hugely valuable and someone who has an abortion without making a rather significant effort to ensure that they understand the issue is acting immorally, as they are not taking the appropriate level of care.\n\nMost people, if they were truly honest, would have to admit that they don't really understand the issue and therefore cannot be justified in having an abortion without knowing that they have solid arguments to support their position.\n\nChange my view.\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "I think zombies are completely overrated threat. CMV + \n + Talking about the 'traditional' slow-moving head-shot zombies, like in the Walking Dead or the World War Z book. In all the media with them, they're somehow this terrible force that has driven mankind to the brink of extinction. And I really, really find them overrated. We have books like World War Z that take the whole War of the Worlds broadcast approach to cast such creatures in a menacing manner, and it just does not hold up in my analysis. \n\n\n\nNow, zombies have the following disadvantages over us.\n\n\n\n- Slow. I mean, a moderately healthy person could outwalk them. \n\n\n\n- Not very dexterous. Want to escape a zombie? Get on top of a bus. \n\n\n\n- Stupid. Zero intelligence, only some extremely basic instincts. Easily outsmarted.\n\n\n\n- Zero survival instinct. Many animals have a survival instinct. Zombies do not, and will proceed with zero regard for their well-being. \n\n\n\n\nNow, they have a few advantages over us. \n\n\n\n- Durability. The only way to stop a zombie is by destroying the brain or destroying it's body in such a way that it can no longer move. Otherwise they will blindly walk/crawl/squirm onwards until they are physically incapable of doing so. \n\n\n\n- Stamina. These bastards will chase you until they find new prey, or their legs fall off. Then they'll crawl until their arms fall off. Then they'll wiggle and squirm until they rot away. This makes running away harder than you'd think, since they stop for nothing and require no food, rest, motivation, or water. They are a biological machine that does nothing but hunt people.\n\n\n\n\nNow, as human beings, we have crushed and dominated vast nations of other human beings which are far more dangerous that zombies. It is my opinion that any zombie outbreak would gain little traction and not last long. \n\n\n\n\n- For one, their only way of reproducing is by going toe-to-toe with their top predator. In order to make a new zombie, they must bite a human. Biting by itself is a pretty ineffective way of spreading a disease, and if you have to bite a highly intelligent creature dedicated to eradicating you, there is a problem right off the bat.\n\n\n\n- The numbers issue. Traditionally, it's a given that zombies are inferior to humans one-on-one, and their strength comes in numbers. It's always a zombie horde that's the threat, too many to plausibly deal with. The thing is though, in order to reach those sort of numbers, at some point the zombies will be massively outnumbered by us. Humans will have the advantage in numbers, not the zombies. \n\n\n\n\n- Killing them is made tough in a way, because you must destroy the head. However, this difficulty is much lessened due to their stupid nature. A zombie will come at you in a steady, consistent manner. They won't run, won't take cover, they will do nothing to avoid being shot at. For people trained to shoot stationary targets, it's simple. For people trained/used to shooting moving targets, it's a walk in the park. \n\n\n\n- The military is more than equipped to deal with them. Large hordes of slow, walking hostiles with zero sense of survival instinct is a bomber pilots wet dream. It's the sort of thing that the B-52 was practically made for, just steamrolling an area with explosives. Any large horde could casually be pounded into a giant crater. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I cannot imagine a zombie outbreak being any sort of world-ending threat. Would it cause a lot of chaos in the city/region? Yeah, but the danger can be escaped by a brisk walking pace and is easily outsmartable. Unless a massive outbreak occurred simultaneously all across the world, I don't believe it would cause half the chaos and devastation a really bad hurricane or other natural disaster would.

{"input": "CMV: I believe it is a cop out to pull the race card on something as complex and unknown as the Ferguson incident. + \n + Hear me out before commenting, please.  Over the past 24 hours I have seen so many bullshit posts on facebook about this.  Being from the south, all of my old friends are posting articles from \"conservative weekly\" about how the verdict was right. On the other hand, a lot of my more liberal friends who I find myself surrounded with now are just ranting about racism and how fucked up the verdict was. \n\nI totally agree. The verdict was fucked up.  I feel as if he could have been found guilty of manslaughter. 6 shots? YES. That is excessive. Four were to the hands/arm and two to the head. That, along with the witness testimonies, for the most part, saying he had surrendered and still was shot constitutes man slaughter. Due to the conflicting testimonies though, he couldn't be charged with murder.  \n\nNot to mention, this all started with Brown robbing a store.  The video of Brown stealing the cigarillos shows him aggressively shoving the convenience store clerk as he attempted to confront him.  This doesn't seem like the temperament of a guy who would just surrender when confronted by a police officer (not to imply that he didn't).  \n\nNow to the point!  I have no idea what happened on that day and how it all unfolded. I have no idea what the motivations of the police officer were.  I have no idea if Brown actually grabbed at the gun of the officer. No one does.  But all I am hearing about is how certain everyone is that is was somehow racially motivated.  \n\nI understand it is totally possible that it was racially motivated or influenced in some way. But it is also equally possible that it was simply a matter of circumstance in which someone who had just robbed a store got too aggressive with a police officer and hasty decisions had to be made.  \n\nI just feel that it is way too easy to mark up such a complex confrontation to a racially motivated slaughtering as a lot of people are acting like, especially when nothing would have likely happened had Brown not initiated confrontation with police by robbing a store.  I think it is much more likely that the officer simply had to make a hasty decision and went a bit over the top. Maybe I have misunderstandings about the facts, and if that is the case PLEASE let me know.  \n\nAll in all, I just think that it is a cop out to pull the race card on an incident in which literally *no one* except the people who were there know exactly what happened. Moreover, NO ONE but the police officer himself knows what his motivations were. CMV\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: Gender should not exist + \n + \nHowever, I hear so much about people with gender dysphoria who don't want to change sex, and non binary genders. So I'd like to see if I'm missing something, as I generally consider myself a fairly progressive person. I don't want to end up as one of \"those old people who won't change their ways\" like many people see older people who dislike gay marriage, so I would honestly like some light shed on why gender is necessary. \n\n\nFirst and foremost: I am not saying that \"gender\" should mean \"man or woman,\" or that trans people aren't real. I am saying that I do not believe there is a reason for gender to exist.\n\nGender is related to masculinity or femininity. As a construct, it does not describe just a person's biological sex, but how they fit into \"gender roles\" or \"gender stereotypes.\"\n\n1. Many gender stereotypes are culturally created. Many jobs which are deemed \"women's jobs\" or \"men's jobs\" are called such because it's ingrained in our culture that they should be. However, in most cases, there is no good reason why these fields should be male- or female-dominated, and I feel that doing so is sexist to both genders, and encourages feelings such as \"this person doesn't belong here, they're not a man/woman,\" where those feelings should not exist. For example, nurses are traditionally a \"woman's job,\" and male nurses are often made fun of for their profession. These gender stereotypes are harmful, and should not exist.\n\n2. Other stereotypes involve what a particular person acts like or likes doing. \"Feminine\" men are made fun of for speaking a particular way, or enjoying things traditionally associated with women. These men may very well be completely straight men, but many people will assume they are gay, or trans, or something based on only their mannerisms. \"Masculine\" women are often made fun of for liking things typically associated with men, and may act \"non-feminine.\" These women, who may very well be completely straight women are often derided for possibly being lesbian, or for being \"too butch.\" These gender stereotypes are harmful, and should not exist.\n\n3. Any actual differences between males and females stem from biology. In such cases, gender has no reason to exist, as it's superfluous when we already have biological sex as a descriptor.\n\n4. Having gender as a \"spectrum\" or having things that are \"masculine\" or \"feminine\" leads to more harmful comparisons. When \"masculine\" is equated with \"being a man\" (as it is in the gender social construct), it implies that a man who likes more masculine things than another man is \"more of a man\" than a man who may enjoy fewer masculine things and more feminine things. The same goes for women. Why should someone who is a nurse and likes cooking, crafts, and Pinterest (things typically associated with women) be \"more of a woman\" than someone who is a professional bodybuilder and likes sports, cars, and MMOs (things typically associated with men)? They shouldn't. Associating interests or professions with \"masculinity\" or \"femininity\" opens up shaming for being \"less of a man\" or \"less of a woman.\" Again, it's toxic, and should not exist.\n\n5. In the ideal case where gender, as a concept, does not exist, the worst possible scenario is that biological sex takes the place of gender, and sex stereotypes remain. In this scenario, there is no difference. However, in the best case scenario, many gender stereotypes lessen or disappear, and people are no longer derided for having interests not associated with their sex. In this scenario, there is a positive change. Because of these scenarios, I believe the existence of the concept of gender has no positive implications.\n\nAgain, this does not preclude the existence of transsexual people. Sexual dysmorphia exists. People would still be allowed to change their sex to the other. However, ideally there would be no cases of transgender people who do not wish to biologically change sex, because gender as a whole would not exist, and thus there would be no gender dysphoria. People who are transgender currently but do not want to change sex would not feel pressure to do things associated with their sex, and thus there would be no gender roles from which dysphoria would stem. The only difference between men and women would be biological. Anything short of sexual dysmorphia would be meaningless and serve no purpose.\n\nFurthermore, before someone inevitably brings up Kleinfelter syndrome, triple X syndrome, etc., I am acknowledging that they exist. I know that intersex exists. For the purposes of filling out paperwork and such, there would be a third option, in the case that someone has both male and female genitalia, or neither, etc. They would not be forced to list as either male or female.\n\nI think I've explained everything as much as I could, so have at it.\n\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: Monetary profit motivation (especially capitalism) makes it next to impossible for anything to reach its full potential + \n + Farmers have no incentive to make good tasting, nutritional tomatoes. \nThey go bad quicker and are more difficult to grow. A farmer instead has incentive to make tomatoes that last longer, and can be grown year round. Making more beneficial tomatoes for society is asking farmers to sacrifice profits. \n\nThe meat industry has no incentive to find more ethically reasonable systems of working. It would be a massive cut in their profits considering their current system is strictly based on efficiency and volume of product. \n\nBatteries that never die? Tires that never lose tread? Whats the incentive? If you didn't have to buy new batteries, you would only spend your money one time. The cut in profits would be massive. \n\nNewspapers, news stations and other media outlets answer to someone at the top of their financial food chain. Those people more often than not care about the bottom line. How many papers are we selling? how many viewers are we getting? This directly interferes with the quality of the journalism being presented by these outlets. \n\nThe medical industry has a tragic lack of incentive to be as efficient as possible for the reasons already outlined above. \n\nBut this issue cuts us down to even much more trivial issues: \n\nWhen someone makes a movie based on a comic book or other intellectual property... they had the idea to do so due to the massive popularity of the source material. However... all of the movies we get inspired by this source material is \"reinvented\" and \"redesigned\"... this is to make them as middle of the road as possible so that grandma, your little sister, your parents and you can all potentially go see the movie. They want that bottom line, the most sales. \nThis is the primary motivation to the metaphorical raping of 80s and 90's nostalgic culture (IE transformers, gi joe, etc.) ... they see something that could get a lot of people to go to the movie theater... wipe their ass with it, and move on. It doesnt matter if they do justice to the source material.. .they just need those ticket sales. \n\nThe music industry has no incentive to promote quality music. Nickleback and Soulja Boi are a dime a dozen... there is a billion of them in every city. Radiohead and MF Doom are uncommon artistic talents... Artists have demands, they want their work to be seen a certain way. They are difficult to work with because they dont care how much money you make by representing them, their art comes first. If you can find any rapper or towny-rock band, promote the crap out of them and over-saturate the masses to a premeditated formula of music-- you cut out your necessity to rely on artists for their art. This is all in the name of your bottom line becoming fatter.  \n\n\nThe examples I could outline are almost inexhaustible. Monetary profit motivation (especially capitalism) makes it next to impossible for anything to reach its full potential. The human race is denied faster advancement and top quality in almost every single aspect of life because of it. \n\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV - I believe in Jury Nullification in that not only is a person on trial, but also the law that's being used against that person in that instance. + \n + [Jury nullification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_nullification) is the idea that juries can find a person not guilty even though they believe that she did commit the act with which she's being charged. I find this to be an amazing idea. If we assumed that all laws are perfect, then there's no need for trial by juries. Twelve judges with greater understanding of the law would make better jurist if all we're concerned with is if a person committed an act that's in violation of the law. With nullification, instead we have 12 reasonable people determining if the law is reasonable in this case. Not only is the person being put on trial, the law itself must be defended by the prosecutor as being justified in this specific case.\n\nIn the US, with its four levels of courts: local, county, state and federal; it provides a protection against abuses of jury nullification. For example, if a man murders a black lady is found not guilty by jury nullification in a county trial, the state and federal government can still convict him. The reason being though the murder was one act, the different levels of government each have their own laws against murder. The rules against double jeopardy do not apply in cases of different institutions convicting a person as they're different laws.\n\nI not only think that jury nullification is a great idea, I believe it should be allowed for the defense to explain to juries about their right to acquit the defendant even if they believe he committed the crime. This in turn can help lead to changes in laws if legislatures begin to see that the people are not convicting other people for certain laws they find unjust. \n\nTo put it in perspective, I see the Appeals, District and Supreme Court as putting the law on trial in all cases.

{"input": "CMV: \"Cultural appropriation\" is not inherently wrong or harmful. + \n + Let's start by taking up an extremely popular example: white hipsters who wear imitation \"war bonnets\" as fashion accessories.\n\nIt seems to me that there are three common objections to this practice:\n\n1. It robs the cultural object of its symbolic power.\n2. It \"exotifies\" the culture to which the object belongs.\n3. It offends members of that culture.\n\nAnswering the first objection is trivial, in my opinion. Symbolic \"power\" is not something that a particular object can \"have.\" It is a function of how an object is understood within a given context. War bonnets that are (or were) sold at Urban Outfitters for the express purpose of being worn as fashion accessories are obviously not understood in the same way as are war bonnets that are (or were) designed to be used as profoundly significant ceremonial garments.\n\nThe second objection is much more sophisticated, and I'm admittedly much less confident in answering it. That said, I can't help but feel that *pretending* to revere an object--pretending, in other words, to be a member of the culture to which the *form* of the object originally belonged--is a much more egregious and patronizing form of \"exotification\" than wearing a war bonnet out of sincere and naive aesthetic admiration could ever be.\n\nFurthermore, I don't accept the notion that anyone's understanding of the traditional significance of the object (in this case, the war bonnet) is meaningfully impacted by the object's appearance in non-traditional contexts. I can't imagine that anyone has ever seen a 20-year-old hipster girl wearing a war bonnet at a music festival and thought to him- or herself, \"Gee, I guess it is and has always been nothing more than a fashion accessory!\"\n\nThe third objection is thornier still, but I'm willing to have a go at it. I think it's perfectly reasonable to call people out for being unnecessarily offensive when there is reason to believe that they *intend* to be offensive. When there is no apparent malicious intent on the part of the offenders, the party who is accusing them of behaving offensively ought to be expected to justify that claim--otherwise, people could go around claiming to be offended by any old thing, and we'd always be obligated to take them at their word. As far as I can tell, there is no good reason for anyone to be offended by white people wearing war bonnets at music festivals. In fact, it seems that the only people who ever really complain about it are white people who *don't* wear war bonnets at music festivals.\n\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: Feminism is not needed *in the USA* + \n + Kind of a long post here, I have a lot on my mind, maybe this isn't the best place to post. \n\nAnyway, this view has many facets to it. Let me lay out some things in general first.\n\n* Yes, I am male. I don't think that discounts my position.\n\n* Yes, I acknowledge that there is an issue of income inequality between men and women. This is bad and needs to be fixed. \n\n* It's possible that my view is a little warped because of the community I grew up in. More on this later\n\n* These argruments pertain only to the USA. Feminism may be very helpful in other less developed countries.\n\n* I am **ALL FOR** equal rights. I just don't think Feminism is helping us get there.\n\n---\n\nSo let's start with some generalities. Then we'll get into a couple specifics. \n\n* Why is the focus so much on women only?\n\nBefore you overreact, hear me out. There are plenty of other groups of people who aren't treated fairly or ethically. We can't we just be concerned about liberty and equality for *everyone*? When someone says \"I'm a feminist\" usually I will think that means that they care about equality of women to the exclusion of all other groups. This has come from several nasty encounters with people who identify themselves as feminists.\n\n*I understand* that this does not represent the majority. Nonetheless, the name now has a reputation, and it's true that there are a fair number of people that think that way, it I believe it to be wrong.\n\nI'm not trying to diminish the issue, I just don't see why we can't be concerned about everyone.\n\n---\n\n* My background\n\nI was raised in a very very safe community. I was taught that women were to be treated with respect and that I'm never allowed to hit a girl. I was taught to defend myself if necessary, but refrain from harming them if physically possible. \n\nI understand that not everyone thinks this way. Regardless, I mention it here as it may be a source of confusion on my view of the world.\n\nAlso, I am a student of engineering. This further affects my view, as in this field, women are preferred for their gender alone. Businesses don't want to appear sexist, and there is an extremely high demand for female engineers. All other things being equal, the woman will be chosen over the man in an application.\n\nI understand a bit more about the school system though, in that it has a harsh disconnect with the previous statement. I remember that I study was done somewhere that just by placing a female name on an application to a university, it had a smaller chance of being accepted. This is quite strange. I agree that it's wrong and needs to be fixed, though I'm not really sure how it can be done.\n\nSo the reason why I say this is that in my field of study, women are considered more valuable than men, thus another item that is influencing my view, which may be incomplete.\n\n---\n\nSo those are my generalities. Not much really, but it's because I have specifics and wanted to avoid repetition. Hopefully that works out and isn't too jumbled up.\n\n---\n\nThese two specifics both came from my browsing Tumblr. I found a couple posts that seem to be a little warped. It seems to me that they have an incorrect view, so let me explain my reasoning and maybe someone can point out where I'm wrong.\n\n---\n\n[First post by yungsunshine](http://yungsunshine.com/post/86796092228)\n\nI'm just gonna drop through each tweet one by one, starting with number 2.\n\n* *Who is telling girls this???* The only case of public groping I've seen, the girl slapped the guy in the face and that was the end of it. Where are they hearing to take it as a compliment? I've never seen any girl be told this.\n\n* I think you just need to get over that one. Everyone - *everyone* - endures verbal persecution. Myself included. You gotta have thicker skin than that. If a close friend says something hurtful, I get why you would be upset. But a random stranger being dumb? We don't need feminism to fix that. We need a better education system. (That applies to a lot of things)\n\n* I'm not an expert on self defense classes for women. I have taken several years in American Freestyle martial arts though. So I don't really know what happened in that training, but I'm guessing the instructor said \"Don't yell rape, yell fire, it's more effective.\"\n\n*This is not bad.* Think about it. If you yell rape, that means that one human being is overpowering another. The action required is to stop the assailant with physical force. This means that someone must 1) hear the call, 2) by physically able to stop an attacker, 3) pinpoint the location of the cry for help, and 4) actually hold off the attacker. There's no such thing as a fair fight. On the other hand, if you yell fire, everyone in hearing distance is prompted to a simple action. *Move* This is going to create a huge amount of commotion and it's going to be easier to get away. The cry of \"fire\" calls to a much smaller skill set for action. That's why it's more effective.\n\n* No offense, but so have men. If you're getting death threats, I'd say you're hanging with the wrong crowd and should probably move. Those people have more than one thing wrong with them, or maybe you owe them a lot of money. That's an issue every human must consider in a dangerous place. Being a woman really doesn't have much effect here.\n\nAdditionally... the tag makes no sense here. So you mean to tell me that \"YesAllWomen\" have lived through every one of those? Yeah, it's nitpicky, so more on that later.\n\n* Yes. Yes it is. Problem? We *all* live in a dangerous world. My girlfriend requires the same of me. I'm not \"safer\" because I'm male. I love my girlfriend and I care about her, that's why I have to know she made it to her destination safely. I'm failing to see any problem with this.\n\nIf the argument is that it's not safe for women to be out, then I believe there's an error in that thinking. *Everyone* is unsafe. Any human could get robbed, murdered, or hit by a car. Your chromosomes don't change anything in the context of that tweet.\n\n* Okay, I can see an argument here. But I still think it's partially messed up. For one, as an individual, you can do nothing to control the actions of others. *Your* safety is *your responsibility.* Don't get mad when people try to help girls do that.\n\nNow, I give you credit. They are being taught the wrong way, and boys should be taught just as much. Personally, I would be a lot more comfortable if my daughter had pepper-spray and a handgun and was trained to use them (correctly) rather than a rape whistle. Additionally, boys should be taught to respect girls. Just like I was. However I don't think that will solve every problem. More on that later.\n\nFeminism can't fix this though. Parents must instruct their children.\n\n\n* Yeah, okay, good point. That's messed up. True, those athletes probably have pretty big heads anyway (not all, just some) so there's more than one issue here. Feminism isn't going to fix the pride of athletes. But it's still a decent point.\n\n* This is where my view may be warped. I have only seen one woman suffer this, and she put the dude in his place. (See above) I have a hard time believing that every single woman in the entire world lives with the threat of male violence every single day of their lives. Not more than any human lives with the threat of serial killers every day of their lives. If they mean it in the sense that it's possible on any given day, then the logic is just broken. Many of us live with the threat of a car accident, or a shooting, or a building burning down every day of our lives. Feminism can't fix the fundamental problems of the human race. (Which there's only one race, by the way, the human race)\n\n* That's messed up. If you as a women are honestly scared that any given man you every meet could kill you, then maybe you don't understand statistics. I'll get into the issue of murders on my next specific issue.\n\n* Finally, the generalities here are impressive. \"YesAllWomen\" is the tag used to report your personal struggles? Not seeing the logic there. It's a generalization that should be avoided.\n\n---\n\n[Second post](http://turn-it-up-tune-them-out.tumblr.com/post/86887543820/literally-all-these-girls-having-fucking-meltdowns) (Not sure who to credit, I don't know how this system works very well)\n\nWell it appears that I'm running out of characters.

Apartment complexes can start refurbishing projects and suburbs can have contests for who can DIY their house to look the nicest. Stores and shop owners can clean up a little better, and the city itself can have a recycling program or a tree-planting program or something. It'll only become a second Detroit if the citizens allow it to.\n\n2)The citizens of the old city can live on the fringes of the new one, like my husband and I do.

Prior to college I never had any sort of opinion about them, though having spend four years at the University of Michigan fraternities have become a sore subject. \n\nI\u2019d like to preface this firstly by noting do have many friends in Greek life, and I don\u2019t judge them for being in fraternities, though fraternities as an entity they frustrate me. As a freshman (and even sophomore), I\u2019ve rushed over a handful of them and received bids from many though something about each of them always made me turn them down. \n\nOne of the fraternities seemed to be made up of a group of nice guys, who just wanted to go out and have fun together. I met several of them at a rush event, and I had a few friends in their fraternity though, one evening when I showed up to one of their house parties with three girls, they turned me down. I didn\u2019t expect much of it. Rather it was almost expected considering I wasn\u2019t even a pledge yet, though standing on the sidewalk I could see a freshman named Will, who lived in my hall and told me several days ago he was rushing. I noticed he was stumbling around the room evidently from having been pressured into drinking too much. A few brothers next to him thought it was funny, so they pointed and laughed at him. The tallest one then walked up to him and shoved Will against the wall. He fell to his knees, and began to throw up. The brothers, being annoyed began kicking and pushing him for several moments until they were bored and left the room to rejoin the party upstairs. Will laid on the floor motionless. I tried to go in and help him, though the two brothers at the gate held me back. I told them I wanted to go in to help Will, who clearly had passed out from physical abuse and alcohol, though they both told me to piss off. I called an ambulance.\n\nA few weeks later I was at a different rush event for another fraternity that many people I knew recommended I rush. After speaking to several of the guys, I was taken to one of the junior rooms to speak to the president. After about half an hour of drinking with them, he pointed at a poster of a model on the wall and asked me what I believed was wrong with her. I said, \u201c nothing, as far as I can tell. I don\u2019t know her.\u201d Judgingly, he looked back at me and said, \u201cShe\u2019s not Jewish. We don\u2019t like non-Jews. Okay, I thought to myself. I know my ancestors have gone through a lot. Hell, my grandparents on both sides of my family are holocaust survivors and their parents endured tough times. Even my parents were in the Lebanon war, not to mention the Spanish Inquisition, Egypt, the Roman Empire, and so forth. I decided I didn\u2019t want to be a part of anything that discriminated against anyone, especially something people were people don\u2019t have a say and were born into. \n\nAnother instance, I was at a high school friend\u2019s fraternity for a pre-game on a football Saturday. Two friends of mine came from out of state to visit, and I thought that pregaming with Greek life would be an ideal way to effectively show them how ridiculous football Saturday\u2019s can be. After having a high school mini-high school reunion among the four of us, I left momentarily to find more drinks before they would be out. When I came back, only one of my friends was in the same location in the yard so I walked over to him. I noticed a nervous expression on his face, and realized two brothers we had no met were pressuring him into drinking through profanity and verbal harassment. \n\nThe amount of times I\u2019ve experienced, verbal and physical abuse, discrimination, hazing, and sexism among other things is absurd.

Transformers 4 (the highest grossing film worldwide) made roughly 15 times its production cost back. So, Planes 2 is the most successful film this year.**\n\n*****\n\nWhile arbitrary, I define financial success as the cumulative revenue a film is responsible for generating (box office, merchandising, secondary markets) as a multiple of its production cost. I also eliminate films costing minimal amounts of money to produce (e.g., a youtube video or independent film not in wide release).\n\nAs a target, the highest grossing film worldwide was Transformers: Age of Extinction, which [grossed] (http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Transformers-Age-of-Extinction#tab=summary) approximately 1.137 billion in its initial worldwide release and domestic US DVD and Blu-ray sales.  Additionally, lets assume that the film grosses another 87 million in worldwide secondary sales, and around 2 billion in merchandising in the next few years. These figures aren't public, but are based on estimates from the original trilogy published by [Variety] (http://variety.com/2014/film/news/transformers-the-anatomy-of-a-cross-platform-money-maker-1201245881/). Transformers [cost] (http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=transformers4.htm) $210 million to make. So, **Transformer's 4's revenue:production cost ratio is around 15.2** (3.2b:210m).\n\nTo beat this figure, Planes: Fire and Rescue would have to have a cumulative revenue more than $760 million (15.2 x [its production cost] (http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=planes2.htm) of $50 million).\n\nWe know that its [worldwide box office] (http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=planes2.htm) was $147 million. It [made] (http://www.the-numbers.com/weekly-video-sales-chart) 22 million in domestic US blu-ray and dvd sales. Additionally, using a traditional international dvd/blu-ray sales multipler, we can estimate roughly 35 million of international sales. So cumulatively, the film has made roughly $204 million from box office and secondary markets.\n\nNow, the film would have to make roughly $556 million from merchandising in order to pass Transformers 4 in revenue:production cost ratio. I would argue that this film will do so easily. Data shows that the Cars series (averaged) [http://www.cnbc.com/id/43525949]. 2 billion per year. The original Cars film made $10 billion in merchandising in 5 years (see previous cite). This $2 billion estimate was also made before Disney expanded its theme parks to include Cars-specific attractions. It is unclear if the Cars/Planes series is still generating $2/yr, and $10 billion/film. However, the merchandising channels have been plowed by former films, and Disney is primed to take advantage of the release of Planes films. So, it would not be unrealistic to think that Planes 2 would generate at least 10% of the merchandising revenue generated by Cars. If Planes 2 generates a mere 10% of the merchandising revenue that Cars 1 generated, it would generate **1.2 billion** in total box office, dvd + bluray, and merchandising. **This gives it a 24-times revenue:production cost ratio, about 1.6 times Transformers 4's ratio of 15.**\n\nTherefore, Planes 2 is likely the most financially successful film of the year. If its merchandising is greater than 10% of Cars 1's total, then it may have been much more successful than any other film this year.\n\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV:Criminal record should have no weight on a persons future and should be disclosed. + \n + Employers, colleges, community positions - these things all require that applicants provide a fully-disclosed criminal record (unless the crime was committed as a minor) if one exists. The stigma of having a criminal record can cost an individual any of these opportunities when he/she is fully capable of that position. The stigma of being a criminal is the issue here. Once someone is labeled a criminal, it consumes his/her identity. I believe more weight should be placed on psychological evaluations of a persons **current** state and an overall evaluation of an individuals **present** character. This discretion should override an individuals **past** criminal record.\n\nThe stigma that follows a criminal is fear of criminals and the belief that he/she is no good for society. We are threatened by this individual because he/she has committed a crime. However, this crime can be entirely non-threatening in the present. A man who sold his friends marijuana when he was 19 is not a threat to society. I believe that psychological evaluations and the evaluation of an individuals character can determine whether that individual is currently a threat or not. Take for instance, [Gina Grant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_Grant_college_admissions_controversy) who was denied admission to Harvard for killing her alcoholic, abusive mother when she was 14. Since then she served 6 months in a juvenile facility, got excellent grades, served in the community, joined clubs, and tutored children. She was initially accepted to Harvard, but they revoked her admission when they uncovered her past. A psychological evaluation would show that she is a good person and her only motive to murder was self-defense against her abusive mother. Furthermore, this was years ago. It's not as if she's a serial killer who is fascinated with murder and may strike against anyone at anytime. They denied her the seat because of her criminal record *although* she was not currently a threat. Hypothetically, they could have instead given that seat to a man with no criminal record at all. However, he is (hypothetically) obsessed with stalking his ex-girlfriend, is planning to murder her, and has completely lost touch with society. Who is the bigger threat and who deserves the seat more?\n\nFinally, I think it's unfair to label people as criminals once they have served their punishment. There's no reason something like a DUI that happened 20 years ago should haunt someone for the rest of his/her life after serving the punishment. According to the labeling theory, by removing individuals functionality in society and labeling them a criminal, they are more likely to re-enter the criminal system.

{"input": "I believe universal public healthcare (no private health sector) is the only morally justifiable system. CMV + \n + I'm from Canada but I have family in the United States and friends from South Korea; three different systems of health care with varying levels of private sector involvement. Of these three, I see Canada's as the most fair, because people of all income levels get the same quality of care (for the most part, it's not perfect). It prevents people from having to make the painful choice between sickness and bankruptcy. Publicly-employed doctors are also more likely to work to prevent illness because they don't get more money if their patients get sick.\n\nThe United States is the worst out of the three, because the quality of care you receive is almost completely parallel with your income level. If you don't have good insurance, when you get sick you essentially have the choice between denying yourself care and making it worse or taking a huge hit out of your bank account. This can mean having to mortgage/sell your house or even skip buying food.\n\nEven if you can afford it, it has the potential to completely ruin your life. For example, my great aunt who lives in Cincinnati was a nurse all her life and her late husband was a doctor all his life. They were smart with their money and saved a lot to be able to retire comfortably. However, my great aunt has chronic hip problems which are not covered by her (already expensive) insurance plan. Frequent trips to the hospital over the years has forced her to live in an expensive elderly care complex, also not covered by her insurance. From all those costs plus hospital bills, she has gone completely bankrupt and has few places left to go.\n\nMy grandmother, on the other hand, lives in Toronto. When she got cancer, everything other than her wheelchair was covered by OHIP (Ontario Health Insurance Plan). Now she's made a full recovery and it cost us relatively little. In fact, out of curiosity we looked up the price of the medication she was taking, and if we would have lived in the States, it would have cost us $30,000 a month. We would have had to sell our house.\n\nNeedless to say, I was happy when the Affordable Healthcare Act was passed, but I feel as if this is only the first step and it will only take us to what South Korea has which is a tier system; the poor gets the bare minimum and the rich have the luxury of shorter lines, better equipment, better-trained doctors, etc. While I think it's a step in the right direction, I still hold firm that higher income level does not entitle you to better chance of survival when you're sick. Instead, taxes should be raised and everyone should have an equally good chance.\n\nA common criticism of Canadian healthcare is that lines are always very long. I think this is because of two reasons: One, nobody ever decides not to go to the hospital because they can't afford it. \"When in doubt, ask a doctor\" is the attitude, as it should be. Two, most science-oriented students nowadays go into engineering or computer science rather than medicine. This can be fixed by encouraging more biology in schools, making more med school scholarships, etc. The solution is not to re-think the entire system.\n\n**TL;DR Universal healthcare is worth the higher taxes and longer lines because all people get the same care regardless of income level, you never have to choose between food or medicine, and hospital bills will never bankrupt you**", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

Disclaimer: I'm neither a vegan nor a vegetarian.\n\nI understand that many vegetarians abstain from meat because they feel morally guilty or they feel that it is wrong to kill animals for food. I suppose that some vegetarians may just not want to take part in eating meat themselves and don't really care about the bigger picture but that seems like a shallow and pointless reason to be a vegetarian to me. While meat-eaters don't actively kill the animals themselves by eating them, they support the slaughterhouses and farms that do kill the animals for food production by continuing to consume meat. If meat is demanded it will be supplied, and vegetarians aim to reduce the demand. This to me seems like a much more legitimate purpose and reasoning for being vegetarian.

{"input": "CMV: I believe that affirmative action is an unnecessary, racist towards Asians, and just a result of Blacks/Hispanics/guilty Whites in positions of power. Finally, it doesn't improve the black condition. + \n + While I know this is a popular topic, I feel that I have specific points in my argument that have not been addressed before.\n\nFull disclosure: I am an Asian living in a high income white town, [Glastonbury, CT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury,_Connecticut) In addition, as a high performing student, I am directly affected by Affirmative Action. In my defense, I would point out that a black/hispanic on the other side would be just as affected. With this argument, everyone has a bias and an agenda. \n\nFirst the facts:\n [SAT Scores](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action_in_the_United_States#Bias_against_Asians_and_whites) (Note: while this is in the criticism sections, please only look at the data and not the editorial comments, as to get a non-biased outlook)\n\n[Black graduation](http://www.jbhe.com/features/50_blackstudent_gradrates.html) (Note: as this is called the \"Black Journal of Higher Education\", I trust that no one will call me out on using a source that favors my case)\n\n       1. Let's address my last claim first: It doesn't improve the \"black condition\" and is unnecessary for the vast majority of blacks/hispanics\n\n-This idea is supposed to \"level the playing field\" with all races. All this actually does is passes deserving and intelligent Whites and Asians over for less intelligent and undeserving people in an environment they can't succeed in. For example, [black graduation rates are much lower than white graduation rates.] (http://www.jbhe.com/features/50_blackstudent_gradrates.html) The difference reaches up to +20 points, which is clearly not equality. This disparity is due to affirmative action putting incompetent and undeserving Blacks and Hispanics in college. However, I must make an important clarification. I believe that the vast majority of blacks can succeed in college, and have done so. Affirmative action is not necessary for these kinds of people. The only people affirmative action helps are those who wouldn't be able to get into college otherwise, and by getting them into college, they will only have false expectations and ultimately perform poorly when they realize that college grading is color blind. This is the idea of [mismatching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action#Mismatching) and has been backed up by research. \n\n          2. Affirmative action unfairly favors blacks/hispanics over Asians, and thus is racist towards Asians. \n\n-Ok, you make the argument that this favoritism towards blacks/hispanics is simply reparations for past transgressions, Jim Crow and the low. Well, Asians have been heavily discriminated against in the past. Jap interment, railroad building, and racial slurs and stereotypes have all been a part of Asian-American history. In fact, I'd argue that hispanics have been least discriminated in US history. [wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_the_United_States#Asian_Americans) From this, if you believe that AA is \"payback\" for past actions, defend the favoring of blacks over Asian Americans.\n\n           3. Affirmative action is a result of blacks/hispanics that just want to favor their own race. \n\nNote: I must admit, for this I have no direct proof, only my anecdotal experience and statements made by others.\n\n-Blacks/Hispanics have more political power in this country than Asians, in both positions of government and constituents in voting. Therefore, I believe AA is simply a way to get the black vote/blacks helping out each other. Obviously, being against this political suicide and will get the racist tag labeled in a second. Clarence Thomas, as he is unaffected by these factors as he is appointed and he is black (this is a big factor, a white Justice would get labeled racist), is able to speak out and say that affirmative action is indeed racist, not only towards other races, but blacks themselves. [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas#Equal_protection_and_affirmative_action)\n\n\nThis is my case. While I do admit I believe very strongly in my position, I would point out that I have remained civil in my point, provided sources, and made full disclosure in my situation and any opinions not directly proven by facts. Most importantly, I recognize that I am heavily influenced by this topic, and thus may be blinded. I hope we can have a civil discourse.\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

The risks to both personal safety and privacy are too severe to force on them just for convenience. \n\nFacebook and social media -used- to be a great way to keep in touch with family and friends, but their focus has clearly shifted towards data collection and monetization. Everyone has what amounts to a 'digital identity' that should be solely under their control. You decide what information about you is put out on the web. It is considered bad form to post information about others without their consent. The same should be applied to children. Parents should leave their child's digital identity alone until the child is old enough to make their own (probably bad) choices. \n\nConsider the following:\n\n* Once an image is on the internet, it's there forever and largely out of your control. There is no way to guarantee that adorable picture of your 4 year old in a bathing suit won't end up on a pedophile's computer someday. Even benign images are now manipulated to be simulated child pornography. Also, identity thieves love to target children because their credit/financial status is not routinely monitored. People have a rather cavalier attitude about what is put online, and it is relatively easy to piece together identifying information (I work in financial security dealing with this exact thing).\n\n* Facebook and other sites will collect, analyze, and monetize data even if you try to keep your kid offline. They will create shadow profiles for people who didn't sign up, collecting the bits of data that come to them. Opting out of a digital identity is already difficult without having one forced on you as an infant. \n* If I were to create a profile for an adult against their will, posting their daily activities and photos for all to see, that person would be well within their rights to be furious.

{"input": "I believe the reason for the toxic community of League of Legends is because of the matchmaking system. CMV. + \n + League of Legends is a game I believed plays based solely on catching opportunities and be able to do very small micromanagement (I will explain these this point later), and in order to succeed in knowing both these categories and execute them well, one need to have experiences in the realm of League game play, in simpler term, in order to be good at League one just need to play the game, the more they play the better they get at it. But when the matchmaking system pair experienced players with inexperienced ones, both parties expectations are not met because of their differences in skills thus both parties rage at one another.\n\nIn my personal experience with the match making system, more often than not, I get paired with newer players who have much less experience in the game, to clarify here is my stats:\n\n* 733 wins in normal\n\n* 345 wins in ranked\n\n* 720 game total in ranked\n\n\nWith a little over 1,400 games, anyone with similar experience would know where a ward should be place so that it would give the best vision, not just any place in the bush, it has to be in a certain area within the bush (top or bottom or middle of the bush depend on the the bush position in the map) and if a person is playing Alistar, they know to keep Riven away from the Adc. These are the very small micromanagement that I talked about, and having knowledge about these micro is a huge factor in deciding the game outcome.\n\nThus when an experienced player get into a team fight with the opposing team, he have a certain expectation of his team mates to do things that they are suppose to do. The key word here is expectation, every Adc expects their support to help them by either attacking the other priority target or by keeping the Dps and Assassin away from the Adc. Now again, these things are not taught in the tutorial and one must experienced it in the game in order to know this.\n\nWhen a player fail to meet these expectations, \"rage\" happens. The question often is \"Why?\" \"why didn't you do this, why didn't you do that\", they asks this because each player have an expectation of what another player should be doing, and each person's expectations is different based on their skill level in the game. An Adc with 50 games under his belt expects his support to act differently than an Adc with 400 games under his belt.\n\nThe issue with the match making system is that it paired experienced players with newer ones and the gaps are tremendous, (often I find my self playing with team mates less than 100 total wins in ranked, some even less than 30) and it is unfair to veteran players to lose a game because someone else is learning the rope.\n\nRage can happen to both parties, the experienced player and the inexperienced ones, some of the things that veterans of League does in a game (initiation, expecting follow ups, go for priority target) some time does not make sense to the inexperience players and vice-versa, so both parties rage at one another for not meeting their expectations.\n\nThe issue with the matchmaking system have been on my mind for a while now, I do not know if there are logistic in place for the matchmaking system or if it just match anyone to everyone, I just felt that this is a good place to put my thoughts process out there to see if anyone else think the same and I welcome any other ideas that would say other wise. I posted this in /r/leagueoflegends and did not get much respond or even a counter argument, I am hoping that it would be different here.\n\nTl:DR: Match making system pair experienced players with inexperienced players and everyone rage at each other for not doing what was expected from one another.\n\n\nThanks everyone for commenting, and a special thanks to /u/stipulation and /u/A_Soporific for adding onto the fundamental cause for rage of League of Legends.", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

I would count that as a \"cap on bottom\" design because the bottle can sit on its cap without concern of toppling.\n\nMy argument is very simple: cap on bottom designs are better, because as the remaining liquid gets to a low level, it remains by the spout and can easily be ejected. Otherwise, high-viscosity liquids require a lot of shaking and squeezing to eject from the bottle, as they have settled to the end furthest from the spout.\n\nI believe cap on top designs (defined here as designs where the bottle cannot rest on its cap without being at risk of falling over) are functionally inferior, with no functional advantages. The only advantage to them at all is that, by having no concern for stability, the cap can be artistically shaped for visual pleasure in arbitrary ways.

{"input": "CMV: I think Benn Wyatt is right that calzones are superior to Pizza in almost every way. + \n + Benn Wyatt made several good points about the virtues of calzones. For those that, god forbid, don't already know:\n\n\nCalzones have several virtues over pizza.\n\n1) Calzones are easy to transport cleanly. By virtue of being surrounded by dough, no sauce or toppings are going to spill during transportation, making carrying a calzone a largely risk free proposition.\n\n2) Calzones maintain their temperature better over distances because their encompassing crust acts as insulation for the pipping hot toppings in the center. \n\n3) As any New Yorker will tell you, the proper way to eat pizza is to fold it in half with each end of the crust pointing upwards, and the crust itself enveloping the toppings. Sound familiar? It should, because it's a calzone!\n\n4) Calzones can be filled with more ingredients than a typical pizza by virtue of their design. Since they are a stuffed bread, there is little risk of excess toppings threatening the structural integrity of the calzone. With a pizza, the more you put on, the greater the risk to the integrity of the pizza, particularly when you take an individual slice. Ever had ingredients slide off the top of a pizza slice just as you were about to take a bite? Sounds like a bit of a food engineering problem. Allow me to introduce the solution: calzones. \n\n5) Calzones reduce wast. Calzones can be baked more readily to sizes fitting an individual portion. Personal pizzas are possible, but are rarely seen in the pizza world. Pizza is a group food, and most restaurants provide that option. To help meet individual needs, slices are offered. However, this introduces the problem of waste. If slices remain unsold, what remains of a pizza will inevitably be thrown out. This is wasteful! Calzones don't have that problem. Calzone's are generally made to order for the individual in a size an individual can eat. One calzone for one person. No waste!\n\nTo me, the answer is clear. We should become a calzone nation. Thank you Benn Wyatt for revealing the truth. \n\n\n1) Presentation. Pizza can be presented visually in ways a calzone cannot.\n\n2) Preparation. Pizza can be cooked in ways that produce an ideal outcome in terms of flavor a way that calzones cannot because the toppings are directly exposed to heat.\n\n3) Pizza is a superior social food as it is more easily shared. \n\n4) Pizza can at least *approximate* some of the advantages of a calzone by folding a slice in half.  \n\n5) Calzones have to have more bread relative to the number of toppings (this is disputed, but if true it is certainly a point in pizza's favor)\n\n6) Moisture buildup is a problem if you add too many moist toppings into a calzone. This prevents certain combinations in a calzone that can be put on a pizza, and is why many times sauces are delivered as a separate item in a ramekin.\n\n7) Calzones cool slower and less evenly, making it difficult to eat on the spot, and meaning that you will get an uneven flavor experience. \n\nThese are all very good points.

My View consists of the following ideas.\n\n1.) The goals of this sort of protest are to inconvenience people so that they will be compelled to act in a way that results in change. This is most effective when the people inconvenienced are ones who have to answer to someone else. I.E. A salaried worker at a company having to tell his supervisor that the freeway was closed due to protesters, and the boss with lots of money being able to support a politician who will enact policy to fix the problem. Students are the individuals with the least resources and relevant experience in this scenario. They are probably the worst people to try and reach out to, because inconveniencing a student only costs them resources they don't have.\n\n2.) The form of protest is not peaceful. It's non-violent but it is not peaceful. Personally, if I had been one of the students inconvenienced by this I would take more heed in my inconvenience than the message being sent. From that point, I would at best actively abstain from doing anything that has to do with the cause, and at worst attempt to make it more difficult for these individuals to congregate in such a way.\n\n3.) This is more of a tangent of my other two points. But to me, this form of protest only seems to encourage behavior opposite to the intended message. To me, all this does is demonstrate that people who care about the issue are all just immature whining kids who don't know how to actively try and change what their dissatisfied with and as a result are too incompetent to actually articulate a meaningful, positive message. What this amounts  to is that, they are actively hurting their cause, because I (and many more people I'm sure) was willing to listen to their point of view before they decided to act like a bunch of jackasses and now I don't want to help them for just that reason. \n\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

We no longer have a need for religion or a need to fear death as we can now answer many of the questions that people fled to religion to find.\n\n\n**1) Religion was created to answer questions of the unknown, we now have other resources that can answer these questions for us.**\n\n* Science and technology have not only disproved religion but have made it almost obsolete. We now understand human biology, space &amp; time (for the most part), human psychology, chemistry, plant life, animal life, water, air, drugs, sociology, there is a lot more that we know now that were unthinkable in the days of religion.

This has caused people to worry over what will happen to them when they die and makes them act differently while alive as they only live to set their place in the afterlife.\n\n* Because of religion people have been taught to fear death. Death is an inevitable event beyond our current comprehension that has existed since the beginning of time. It is not only pointless to fear death, but absurd.\n\n* Death is something in life that is uncontrollable and simply just happens. We don't have to understand death or what happens after death, we just have to understand it and accept it.\n\n* Death happens everyday, that's how life works, trying to come up with an answer to \"comfort\" yourself with is illogical and irrational. Accept that it happens, just like birth, and move on so that the fear of death is not lingering over you for the rest of your life.\n\n\n\n**4) Religion separates humanity.**\n\n* When a certain train of thought is drilled into someone mind, it is hard for them to change their views and no longer accept what they thought was true for so long. This has caused a separation of logical, progressive and political thought as people are on opposite sides of the spectrum on many social matters due to the teachings of their religion and has held back humanity atrociously.\n\n* The separation that religion has caused can also be tied in with the problem of nationalism, but instead of people from different countries hating each other, you have people in the same countries who start violent feuds with each other due to different beliefs, even though all of their beliefs preach \"non-violence\" and \"respect\". \n\n\n\n**5) Finally, people who cling to religion lack proper intellect and reasoning.**\n\n* People so foolishly cling to religion as a form of comfort because they are too ignorant to open themselves to a different train of thought. It scares them to think that what they have relied on for so long is false and believe that a world without religion would be utter chaos.\n\n* People who rely on religion need to wake up and escape the ignorant mindset that has been almost engraved into them. \n\n* We need to stop preaching and supporting religion in our society as it is detrimental to the growth of human intellect, and is nothing but a flawed and hypocritical system that is run on fear, subjugation and false attainment/happiness.\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

CMV + \n + This is a very specific to peer-reviewed scientific journals and does *not* include recent initiatives like Obama\u2019s push to increase access to public/government-funded data [^1](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/02/22/expanding-public-access-results-federally-funded-research) \n\nThe main crux of my argument is that, *if adopted universally*, the open-access model of peer-reviewed scientific research for journals would effectively shift the cost burden from the reader/consumer of scientific literature to researchers/producers and this is a net-negative for the advancement of science overall.\n\nAssumption 1: It costs something to create, manage, and publish a scientific journal. The amount is irrelevant, lets just call it $X.\n\nAssumption 2: There are more readers/consumers of scientific research journals than there are researchers/producers. \n\nTo illustrate my point I\u2019ll be using the open-access journal [*PlosOne*](http://www.plosone.org) and the \u2018traditional\u2019 journal [*Nature*](http://www.nature.com). Now if I want to publish a research article in PlosOne it would cost me $1,350 [^2](http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/authors/) They do say that they have waivers available for those who cannot afford this fee, but that \u201cmost authors pay the full fee\u201d. Conversely, a 1-year subscription to Nature for an individual is $199 [^3](http://www.nature.com/ecommerce/subscribe.action?productId=nature). Neither of these costs are negligible, especially for students, but the subscription cost is considerably less prohibitive than the publication cost, especially when you consider the fact that many institutions (both public and private) confer access to affiliates. I've been affiliated with 3 universities in the US in a research role and none of them have ever covered the cost of publishing in an open-access journal (either as a student or full-time researcher)\n\nNow up until this point, nothing I have said supports the notion that this scheme is bad. In fact, I believe the ideal situation is to have a mix of open-access and traditional journals because they serve different purposes. However, I think this issue is obfuscated by the use of the term \u2018open-access\u2019. The reason I believe this model is bad is that it would lead to an environment in which only those with the resources to publish have the opportunity to disseminate their results. Institutions (both academic and private) would have an immense advantage in publishing research and it could narrow the possibility of contrary findings reaching wide audiences. This is obviously a situation in which the truth regarding research could be overshadowed by vested interests. Hypothetically, Pharma company Z could pay to have 50 studies published showing the efficacy of drug Y whereas the small independent group of researchers can only afford 1 study showing the opposite. This would magnify the already existing problem of [publication bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias) and could be disastrous.\n\nThis is getting long already so I\u2019ll just add one more point regarding the advancement of science. I think there are competing interests in the world of science between advancement and dissemination. These two things are not mutually exclusive by any means but are often in conflict. It appears \u2018traditional\u2019 journals are more focused on the former whereas open-access journals are focused on the latter. While dissemination and access are both important I believe that for measured scientific progress to occur we need to encourage more data/results, not less. Universal adoption of the open-access model towards scientific research would be an obstacle to this goal. \n\nCMV!", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

Ultimately, we leave the game early as of course the fat situation had become too much weight for my father to bear as well.\n\nTo my mind, she and her S.O. should have bought extra seats as they're already kind of tight for normal-sized adults.

If a man puts his hand on a neighboring woman's thigh on the plane or at a sports event, it is harassment; it should not be any different if a fat person puts their rolls of fat against someone.\n\nFat people have other options, too, besides buying another ticket:\n\n* Exercising and eating healthier\n* Staying home and watching the game on TV\n\nIf they choose to go for the immediate gratification of buying the one ticket and gambling on whether someone will be seated next to them (and be willing to complain), they should expect sanctions of being compelled to buy another ticket or leaving without refund.\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "I seriously think that people in the Western world really have no right to complain about \"corruption\" and the like in their countries, and doing so is extremly inconsiderate of real problems in the world. CMV + \n + I want to start with a bit of a backstory. My mother's birth family (she was adopted at birth) live in the Dominican Republic as what many people here would consider gypsies. They have a single caravan (which four people share) and live in absolute poverty (hence why they put my mom up for adoption). The travel across the countryside with very few possession to their name. Every now and then my family and I would visit and despite having almost nothing aside from the absolute basics (no electricity, no access to clean water, only access to a few local growing plants and animals) they're are incredibly happy with their lives. They're extremely humble and refuse help from my mother whenever she offers to give them money. In fact, they're a lot more happy than the majority of people I know both here in Canada and on this website. \n\nThe point of that story is I'm absolutely sick and tired of people complaining about \"how bad it is over here\" when they don't even have the slightest idea of what bad is. A popular sarcastic saying here on Reddit is \"Oh well since things are worse in other parts of the world I guess we shouldn't protest or complain about our conditions here\". However, unless we one day find ourselves in some \"utopia\" where everyone lives the exact same standard of life with no disparity whatsoever there's always going to be someone worse off than you. Personally I'd rather live as the poorest person in a place like Norway, Canada, or even the US as an average person in a place like East Timor, Bangladesh, or Angola. I'm extremely grateful of everything I had, and stories like my grandmother's humble me because I realize how grateful I should be that I can eat and drink clean water. \n\nAll this demonizing of the 1% is, in my opinion, just a subconscious jealousy of middle class Westerners who want to absolve their guilt for having an easier life than others. This opinion doesn't just go for income disparity either. I'm infuriated when people complain about \"how corrupt the US government is\" because of the NSA and the Manning prosecution, or of how \"corrupt the Canadian government is\" because the conservative Prime Minister paid off a senator around $90,000 (while the country conveniently ignores a $500 million wasted by the liberal provincial government in Ontario.. but that's for another rant).\n\nIn short, I don't think the majority of Westerners realize how GREAT they have it here, and it's insulting to me (both to myself and those living in third world countries) when these people don't realize this. I was raised to be grateful for what I have, and to not \"bitch and moan\" (my parent's words not mine) if I didn't get what I wanted, but instead to work for it. So Reddit, please CMV.

{"input": "CMV: I think the downvote function on reddit is a problem. It stifles conversation and creates both a sounding board for popular views and a hostile environment for unpopular or even new views. + \n + First, I recognize the irony that downvoting this CMV would be tacitly agreeing with my argument. \n\nOk, to begin, I recognize there is definitely a good use for the downvote button - when people spam or write racial remarks, etc - a low score hides the comment / it eventually gets deleted by mods. \n\nHowever, this could be fixed by a simple 'mark as spam/offensive' button that once received enough hits, would also be deleted.\n\nNow, on to the main point:  There's no need for a downvote button.  Don't agree, think the point's uninteresting, then leave it alone - or better yet, respond as to why it's not a good point.   \"this has been discredited - see here\" or \"this has been asked before - see here\"\n\n The psychological problem is that new knowledge is threatening and people use the downvote button as an easy way of showing their disagreement without actually thinking about it.\n\n\nFurther, The problem with a downvote is that interesting but controversial points get low scores, when they really should be getting some of the highest ones. \n\nConsider an example where you have 3 possible comments.\n\n1) A good comment where everyone agrees\n\n2) A bad comment where everyone agrees\n\n3) A good comment where most people disagree.\n\nLet's imagine 100 people voting:  with the current system, the first comment will get the most (high upvotes, low downvotes).  The second will get the second (few upvotes, but fewer downvotes).  The third will get the worst score (some upvotes - more than #2, but many downvotes).  \n\nGiven by how most people read reddit (and the psychological tendency for people to be influenced by what's popular) - these good, but new ideas will be ignored.\n\nNow you may say: Just sort by controversial.

Although, erasing the downvote doesn't get rid of this problem entirely it helps.\n\nUltimately - my view is that, although not the initial intention, the downvote serves as an implicit \"I don't agree with this, but I don't feel like thinking about it, or explaining to the person why, so I'll just hit this button.\"  Doing so keeps dissenting views and novel questions out of reddit, or at the very best - leaves people with the hanging question of why their thoughts are wrong.", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

Whilst extra-time is added on for injuries it is not usually added for set plays. This is incredibly frustrating for supporters to watch and can make a match very boring, especially if a team starts doing this from early in the match.

One family would essentially sell their daughter to another for political or economic reasons. Sometimes, they might have done it to improve their social standing. But it wasn't something that a man and woman did for love. They may have learned to love each other later, but they didn't love each other when they married.  \n\nFortunately, we no longer approve of the dowry system.

I disagree.  \n\nWhile I certainly don't think it's right to see or treat your child, especially your daughter, as a piece of property to be sold or traded for political, economic, or social reasons, I do think that children owe something to their parents. Your parents brought you into this world. Ideally, they clothed you, fed you, paid for your education, taught you the right things, loved you, and sheltered you. To me, it just seems selfish to say \"Welp, thanks for everything. Now I'm gonna make this major life decision without your approval.\" Marrying someone your parents don't like seems selfish to me. They've given so much to you - again, ideally - I think it's only fair to give them something back.  \n\nBesides, arranged marriages aren't formed by two people lost in emotion. When people marry for love, like in the west, they tend to see each other through rose-colored glasses. They don't see each other realistically and they idealize each other. They get married in a rush and then, later on, find out that they're incompatible and end up getting divorced. By contrast, arranged marriages are set up by two people who aren't lost in emotion but are genuinely looking out for their children's best interests. They look at more important things like financial stability and education background. It's kind of like when a kid wants to eat only pizza and ice cream but his/her parents give the kid healthy nutritious food instead.  \n\nThe statistics bear me out, as well. Generally speaking, arranged marriages tend to have lower divorce rates (less than 2% in India, I think), and lower rates of infidelity and abuse. Meanwhile, half of marriages formed on the basis of love (especially in the US) end in divorce and infidelity and abuse run rampant in the west.  \n\nWe tend to think that acceptance marrying for love is a sign of progress.

However, I have seen something different first developing when I was teaching, I see it with my kid\u2019s friends and I certainly see it on Reddit. Kids today with their constant phones and socially media are being raised by misguided parents to believe that they are special, that they can never do anything wrong and should never be judged when they do something incredibly stupid. There is no accountability or responsibility in their world. This is leading to so many kids who are not equipped in any manner to actually produce in the real world and are honestly puzzled when they fail. I believe that a solution to this is a year of federal service after high school and prior to entering college. This could be some form (not full-fledged) of military service, infrastructure jobs like the WPA used to have, construction, cleanup, social work, tutoring, name it. Many of these jobs simply don't get done now but would bolster the economy on a long-term basis. Not make-work, but a strategic use of a new workforce that is usually contributing nothing productive during that year.  The pay would be minimum wage and housing would be covered as well. Politics and the viability of passing a law aside, I feel this year would \"open\" their eyes to reality and provide them an opportunity to function productively in a social environment where production matters more than bullshit. They would then enter college or the workforce with a much more mature and realistic view of the world and themselves.

The recent news and opinions of some friends have gotten me more interested in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine. I'm torn between both sides because I feel both are justified in what they're doing- to a point. Israel aims to defend its country while Palestine wishes to regain what was theirs. However I see horrible attrocities on both ends of the spectrum and flawed reasonings for the actions of both. \n\nI see many people blindly following Israel and claiming that they are stopping the terrorists against their state and that they have a right to exist as a country now. Then I see many others that are in support of Palestine and even the removal of Israel. On both sides I've seen many supporters of essentially slaughtering all of the other side.\n\nAll of these people's perceptions on the issue lead me to think that they're blindly following their faith or their limited percpetion on the issue. Personally I find it hard to decide if either one is right or wrong and I don't see it as a black and white issue at all. But so many people seem to be extreme on both ends. I just wish the two sides could try and work it out and coexist, but I see so many people that think the Palestinians need to be removed or on the other hand say that agression against Israel will not stop until it returns the land it has stole or \"all of the Jews are exterminated.\"\n\nSo that would be my perception of the issue. I see two extremes with little compromising people making any vocal opinions.

If Ferguson's black residents feel that the police are more like an occupying force than it is their neighbors protecting them, adding tanks does not dispel that notion.

{"input": "CMV: I Should Stop Identifying as a Liberal + \n + \n\nIt used to be obvious to me that I was a liberal. I had an intellectual bent, was an atheist, and strongly disagreed with many policies the George W. Bush administration implemented when I was in high school and college. I was interested in exploring foreign cultures, food, and ideas and had even decided to stay in the international dorm as a freshman in college. As a computer science major and then an entry-level software engineer, I was excited about how my chosen career path could advance the state of society and how we live our lives. Most of my friends and even acquaintances leaned liberal or at least not towards the right. The culture and media I immersed myself in had an undertone of liberalism.\n\nNow I am over eight years into my career and have grown somewhat cynical about politics (at least in the U.S.); being more introverted and intellectual, I was always more attracted to theory than day-to-day political activism and partisan brinksmanship, but I had put hope into the idea that a Democratic president and Congress would implement more liberal policies. Well, on social issues, things seem to be coming around: marriage equality and decriminalizing marijuana. On broader social and economic equality, I feel less optimistic although the push to increase the minimum wage may have some success. In a sense, I feel Democrats are not really committed to economic equality and have started feeling a bit of an, \"If you can't beat 'em, join 'em,\" attitude towards things like finance and taxation; that is, I've started investing in the stock market, socking more of my income into my 401(k), and looking at how I can retire or at least be financially independent in my forties. My reading of philosophy, history, etc. has decreased considerably as I feel compelled to keep up with the state of the art in my field instead. The kind of creativity and whimsical insights one has in college and younger seem to have decreased, I guess, as my life has taken on much more structure and routine.\n\nWhat's more: Some of contemporary U.S. liberalism's causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres are ones I am lukewarm about or in some cases not fond of; more so, issues that affect me most are often not really on the mainstream political radar at all. Legalizing recreational marijuana is something I would vote for if put to ballot, but I personally don't smoke, and neither do most of my friends. There's been political consciousness formed around everything from race to gender to socio-economic class to immigration status; but there hasn't been for nerdy guys. People passionately defend LGBT people's right to love whomever they choose and to marry them. My \"love life\" throughout my twenties was a handful of awkward first dates, so I really feel left out of this whole aspect of life, yet no one has rallied in defense of nerds.\n\nLastly, what we've seen in Baltimore appalls me. I live and grew up in the St. Louis area, which only months before was affected by the Michael Brown/Darren Wilson incident in Ferguson, so I followed the story closely. My initial kneejerk was that the shooting was completely unjustified; I had heard firsthand officers in SLMPD uniform say bigoted things (and not just about black people). I followed the news closely and watched the riots unfold in Ferguson and South City. As more information became available, I started thinking it may well be possible Wilson shooting Brown was justified; the convenience-store robbery before the confrontation, the physical struggle with the officer, and the physical evidence led me to conclude Wilson may have been telling the truth. Unfortunately, Michael Brown was already being held up as a martyr, and now his supporters seemed closed to any new evidence. Living in St. Louis, I understand some of the fucked-up dynamics at play here: the lingering racial issues, the stagnancy, the neighborhoods with failing schools, the pockets of severe poverty and crime. Still, it felt wrong to hold up Michael Brown as a martyr, and then the riots\u2014the looting, the arson\u2014filled me with disgust. The following tactics of closing down highways and die-ins at random places\u2014perhaps because I saw Michael Brown in a more negative light by now\u2014did not sit well with me either; I felt like voting Republican out of sheer spite.\n\nIn short, I've become more focused on my career, more focused on FIRE, more cynical about politics, and more focused on personal concerns like dating; and I've become somewhat annoyed at some of the antics the contemporary social justice movement has done. I certainly don't identify with conservatism or, for that matter, free-market libertarianism; but I'm feeling skeptical about whether I can call myself a liberal any longer.

{"input": "CMV:Political Correctness/Tolerance in Europe is destructive for society. Political Correctness/Tolerance is possibly worse than elitism(May not be the right word). + \n + Alright, so there are two main views I currently have. \n\nThe first is that the current levels of Political Correctness/Tolerance most countries have, especially in Europe, is detrimental to society, seen as how ISIS is actively allowed to recruit in the streets and how the government of certain countries are afraid to punish Muslims for committing Rape  (I believe there were stories about Denmark for instance.) and hate crimes (The most recent that come to mind are attacks on Israelis in Europe by Muslims). Simply put, it is allowing horrible, even socially destroying, ideas to be nurtured.\n\n\nAlright, this view is a bit more challengeable I would say and quite more extreme. The current levels of PC/Tolerance are even worse for society than elitism. This is because PC/Tolerance actually causes society to digress instead of progressing. Elitism, I will define it as people being given less leeway for having flaws/not contributing to society. The extreme version would be how the Nazis were elitist in that only Blond Blue Eyed ~~Aztecs (The race they used escapes me at the moment, but it started with A)~~ Aryans! were upheld while all others were seen as inferior, with people with disabilities being persecuted and especially those of other races/religion. That is naturally too extreme however. The elitism I am talking about is elitism of ideas. This would mean a hard crackdown on ideals such as the ISIS, Communism, Anarchy groups and the like as they are threats to society's overall morality and peace of mind. I understand this has problems in itself, especially for those who advocate more \"liberal\" ideals and identities such as LGBT as it promotes close-mindedness but given that the current state of the world, it probably would not affect them too much and probably wouldn't warrant a government crackdown as it doesn't pose an imminent threat to peace or society. The bigger problem I would see is strikes and such movements that protest the government can be labelled as \"disruptive\" but eh, governments seem to do that right now regardless of Tolerance or Political Correctness anyhow.

As it stands currently where I live, a woman can have an abortion, but she has to go in and talk to someone alone to be sure the man isn't forcing her. But, what if the case is the opposite? What if the pregnancy is an accident, and the woman doesn't want to keep it, but the man does. It seems unfair to me that when a child is born, if the woman wants it and the man doesn't, hes forced to pay child support, but if the position is reversed the woman can just go have an abortion. Essentially, that's saying that the man has no rights to the life of a fetus, even though it's his the same way it will be if its born. Before it's born, he has no rights over it and can't accept it as his, and after it's born he's forced to. I think in the case of an accidental pregnancy, if the woman does not wish to have a child and the man does wish it enough to lose the woman over it, she should have to carry the baby to term and the man should get sole custody afterwards. If the position were reversed, the man could take off, and the woman could have the baby herself. (For the sake of this argument I'm ignoring cases in which carrying the baby is harmful to the mother, that would of course still be abortion-able (terrible word...)). I understand that that would force the woman to spend nine months carrying a baby she would not want to, but that would be a consequence to her actions (everyone knows sex is never 100% safe, so its a risk we take every time. Sometimes you draw the short stick). Paperwork would have to be signed beforehand to ensure that once the baby is born the woman has no responsibility towards it. \n\nTLDR: Why do women get the entire say on an abortion?

It is the responsibility of the parent to take care of the basic needs of their child, and adequate food/nutrition is one of those basic needs. Sending the child to school does not absolve them of that responsibility, and does not transfer that responsibility to the school.\n\nThe most common argument I have heard is that children are required to go to school, and therefore the school is acting as a \"parent\" for those eight hours and is responsible for providing for the students' needs during that time. I don't find that argument reasonable for two reasons. The first is that the school is not responsible for providing any other consumable goods to the students (pencil, paper, clothing, etc.) and it is unreasonable to arbitrarily assign the responsibility of nutrition to them. Secondly, if the child was not at school, the parent would be responsible for providing lunch. The need for lunch is not caused in any way by the student being in school, and I cannot understand why the parent would be absolved of this responsibility due to a change in venue.\n\nPlease note, my argument does not include parents who provide lunch for their children by signing up for the free/reduced lunch program, as I feel this adequately fulfilled their responsibility.\n\nPlease help me, as I can't help but feel all the people who argue for free lunches for all students are a bit off their rockers.

{"input": "CMV: Education is the only way to end intolerance + \n + This CMV is born out of a discussion I had with a friend wherein we compared the modern Feminist movement to the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. I took the stance that during the Civil Rights era, Martin Luther King Jr. was more successful than Malcolm X because he took a more tempered approach, presenting arguments that simply could not be denied, and using tactics like sit-ins to prove the brutality of the oppression by the racists of the era rather than using offensive tactics to get the oppressors to back down in submission. If I recall correctly, my friend argued that he was successful because he did not in fact take a tempered approach, but instead that his tactics were very in-your-face, citing his quote that freedom cannot be attained by simply asking. (NB: I pretty much just talking about civil rights, here. Political and economic inequality are somewhat different issues)\n\nHere's a basic outline of my position and the opposing one:\n\nMy belief:\n\n- Equality for any oppressed group can only logically happen if the enough of the oppressors realize their fault and change\n\n- Ignorance breeds intolerance, and therefore education breeds tolerance\n\n- In the case of the Feminist movement, activists should work to make society aware of problems and favor hard data to rhetoric (not that rhetoric isn't useful)\n\n- You're better served by telling someone why they're wrong than by berating them\n\n- Criticize the action rather than the person. For example: tell someone that what they did was racist, not that they're racist and they should feel ashamed (even if they are)\n\n- Equality not only means being able to achieve the same result as another person, but being able to achieve it with the same ease/difficulty\n\nOpposing belief:\n\n- Equality for any oppressed group can only be achieved by empowerment of the oppressed group, enabling them to go their own way\n\n- Gains need to be won without any connection with the oppressor, because they're not going to help. If they were, they wouldn't be oppressors\n\n- Feminist activists should take what's rightfully theirs instead of waiting for it to be handed over to them\n\n- You're better off berating someone who practices intolerance to express the seriousness of what they've done\n\n- Criticizing an intolerant person's character might make them reconsider their positions\n\n- Activists have been trying to educate for a long time, and the hate is still flowing\n\n*TL;DR - What serves modern movements like the fights for women's and minority rights better: the approach of MLK or that of Malcolm X?*\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

This is a definition *so basic* that pretty much anyone who isn't *totally anti-women* would say their values are in agreement with. Generally speaking, unless someone is openly sexist, they will say that they are for women having equal rights legally, equal payment for equal work, the ability to run legitimately in political campaigns (as well as the right to vote), and the right to be treated socially as autonomous individuals with thoughts, feelings, desires, and opinions (and not merely objects for male amusement). \n\nSince every reasonable person will agree with the fundamental tenets of women's rights, I don't think it's responsible or correct to claim that these are all it takes for someone to be a feminist. Everyone is a \"liberal feminist\" in a sense. But not everyone is actually a feminist. If all it took to be a feminist was to agree with basic liberal feminism, we wouldn't need the term. It would be nearly synonymous with \"human being\" and hold absolutely no weight or connotation whatsoever.\n\nIn order to actually be labeled a \"feminist\", I think it should require at least one of the following:\n\n* The belief that society is organized in a patriarchal manner (society is chiefly organized around male authority figures) and that this is damaging or worthy of changing\n\n* Masculinity and femininity are concepts maintained and propagated because they are useful tools in organizing people (not by merit of any of their actual skills) and making sure that society adheres to gender roles\n\n* It is important to criticize traditional scientific discourse as being historically biased towards a male perspective (in biology, bioethics, psychology and sociology especially)\n\n* Society nurtures an implicit bias which is more likely to promote and praise works/media produced by men and from male perspectives than work produced by women (in television, film, novels, plays, music and visual arts).\n\n* Standardized concepts of language, formal logic, and similar systems can and have been tailored to privilege predominantly male-oriented perspectives. How we talk about good reasoning skills, or how we talk about the use of grammar, for instance, are created with traits associated with masculinity. Even our very concept of emotion and emotional reasoning has negative gendered perspectives in it.\n\n* Men are not more entitled to certain career positions just because of their gender, so efforts to hire more women are not \"Women stealing my job\" but simply \"A woman getting the job\". Until we exist in a system that truly hires people based on skill and experience without gendered biases, programs, mentorships, and other efforts to hire women will be necessary and in line with promoting equality.\n\nThere are many more perspectives, but I think if someone cannot agree with any of the above points, and can't agree with or approve of the kind of reasoning behind them, it wouldn't make any sense to call that person a feminist, even if they agree with liberal feminism.\n\nMaking liberal feminism the only standard one has to meet to be called a feminist is setting the bar *way too low*. If we accepted this as the only standard for feminism, it would be extremely easy for people with sexist views to legitimately call themselves feminists. It makes \"feminism\" = \"just being okay with women's equality\" and not actively challenging a male-dominated world. \n\nAfter studying feminism in an academic setting, there were many ideas I agreed with and many I disagreed with. I still feel that I disagree with enough feminist ideology to not call myself a feminist, despite promoting many feminist ideas and believing that women should have political, social, and economic equality to men.\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV:Online interactions, relationships and obligations aren't inherently inferior to \"real life\" ones. + \n + Just as a preface: I am not a native english speaker, so this may end up a lot longer than would be \"needed\". I'll include a TL;DR. Also, while I'm using myself as an example, that's both due to some personal experiences and to make writing this easier. This is not about \"me\", per se. \n\n**TL;DR: Ultimately, people on the internet are still that - people. What this means is that any online interaction, friendship and obligation, involves real people and should be held to the same standards as offline interactions. What you wouldn't do someone in \"real life\" should also not be done online, be in a forum or elsewhere. This doesn't mean the internet is \"more\" or \"less\" important than offline interactions; it means that both are important and \"it's just the internet\" is not an excuse to diminish relationships, be impolite, not take things seriously when you're expected to, constantly bail out on stuff you've agreed to do and such.**\n\n\nTo start with a simple example I believe most people will agree with, people should try their best to be polite in any online interactions. This includes discussions and such. You don't randomly offend someone in a bar table because he disagrees with you, and you shouldn't do that online either. Of course, sometimes discussions can get heated and \"shit hits the fan\", but that feels like the default state of any discussion online, and I believe that the main reason for that (and everything else I mention here), is because most people either fail to realize that they're dealing with another PERSON on the other end, or simply don't care. That just shouldn't happen. \n\nAnother example I want to tackle is online friendships. These, I feel, are almost universally seen as \"inferior\" to real life ones and shouldn't be prioritized over \"real life\" interactions, no matter the context, and I really have to ask why is that so. I'm not saying that if you have a bunch of online friends and have \"no need\" for real life interactions, I'm just saying that an online friend is still, for all intent and purposes, a \"friend\". And it's all right to prioritize said friend over a real life social event if you are that close with him, just like you would probably prioritize going to your best friend's birthday party instead of go out drinking with your co-workers, if both events are scheduled at the same time. That it's all right to confide things or  ask a a really close, decade old online friend, for help and such. It's okay if your \"best\" friends live far away. They're not necessarily inferior to RL ones. \n\nTo give a personal example, I have a very tight group of online friends that I interact with on a daily basis. We know each other for almost 10 years. Some of us married, moved to a different country, live too far to reasonably have any chance to meet offline, and still, we're extremely close. Just like any social group, some are closer than others, a few of them easily being my \"best\" friends. If that group wants to have a skype conference on a friday night just to mess around and talk, yes, I will prioritize it over pretty much any non-emergency RL event. If someone at work calls me to a happy hour, \"sorry but I already have plans\" is my answer. I feel a lot of people disagree with this, because they see real life interactions as inherently more important\". In this example I gave, no, they are not. If it's someone's birthday party, or wedding, or any other kind of \"major\" event, then maybe I would give it priority. But, as you can see, I'm comparing things on a case by case basis, and not just \"AH, it's just my internet 'friends', they don't matter\". They matter just as much as any other person I have a similarly close relationship with. They're people.\n\nThis also extends to what I believe is my most \"controversial\" opnion, and that's about internet \"obligations\". What I mean with this is, if you agree to do something for someone on the internet, again the standards should be the same as when you do so offiline. It would be assholish back out an appointment for minor reasons in RL and that standard should also be applied online.\n\nFor example, say you join a team or guild for some online game. You agree to meet Wednesdays and Thursdays 8PM. \n\nThen you miss a day without warning because there was a sports game you wanted to watch. You miss another day because you just weren't feeling like it. And another because you agreed to help your neighbour move a sofa in his house or something. Then you agreed to go to the bar when you knew you have to be available somewhere else at that time. I'm sorry, but that's assholish. \n\nI believe most people would not flak out on, say, a minor neighbourhood soccer team's game because of said reasons. Doing so would be rude to your team and screw them up. They would not be able to play the game, or have to find an inferior replacement not used to the team, and that would impact their enjoyment and performance. Guess what? THE EXACT same things happens to the online gaming group. But, again, because they're seen as \"not as important\" as real life, it's suddenly \"ok\" to do so. \n\nNote that I'm not advocating you to raid with your WoW guild or w/e when your SO wants to have some time with you on that particular day, or a major event demands your attention. But wouldn't that kind of major situation also make you miss playing with your \"soccer team\"? And using the soccer team example once again, if you know you have to be with them X days at Y times, you will likely try to make your other obligations and events not happen at the same time. You'll see if you can change the time, make it ealier or latter, change the day and so on. You won't always be able to, of course, but my point, once again, is that people should evaluate things on a case by case scenario, and that it's wrong and perhaps even assholish to always put internet relationships \"last\" on your social priorities list. \n\n*When you screw people online, ignore them, are inpolite, bail out of stuff you agreed to do with them and treat your relationship with them as inherently less important than everything else, you're treating PEOPLE as less important, for a reason that I simply can't agree with.*\n\n\n*I am saying you should not devalue online relationships and obligations just because they're online, putting them \"always last place\" regardless of the impact this might have on the online people that you interact with and your relationship with them. I'm saying that it's not wrong to prioritize important online friends over RL events that are not as important to you*\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

Many MRAs seem to hate that all men are expected to be wealthy, incredibly athletic, and outgoing, but so do most feminists! This belief, that men should behave in a certain way, is sexism. Most feminists care more about female victims of feminism because women are hurt more. It's awful that men usually lose custody suits, but the fact that women will have to pay for *rape insurance* in Michigan is far worse. Women's problems are a lot more numerous than men's issues.

Now in a capitalist society, people start a business with an idea or vision, then fund their ideas with their own personal money, though a few family members or friends may feel free/happy to give some money or help with said business idea. For example if I wanted to open a coffee shop in town, I'd fund the business idea and fruition with my personal bank account and if my parents and friends wanted to, they could send some spare cash my way, though I wouldn't expected them to nor are they obligated to do so. With crowdfunding, I feel like you're essentially begging for money via the internet. It's the internet equivalent of standing on a street corner with a tin can asking strangers for change. I think if you have an idea and you want to make it happen, you should be get it done yourself without begging your 200 Facebook friends for money. For example, one of my friends that I've known for years decided she wanted to go find the identity of her biological parents. She was adopted as an infant and doesn't know who her biological parents are. So she started a crowdfunding campaign asking for $2,000 to cover the expenses of finding her parents through an adoption agency. If I were in her shoes, I'd never ask for other people's money, I'd pay the bill all by myself instead of asking for money from other people via Facebook.\n\nMy next point is, I think crowdfunding is a waste of time and money, for both the requesting person(s) and the people that give money to whatever they're giving money to. It's waste of time for the person starting their campaign because most people will never see their idea get off the ground. Going back to what I said above, people don't like it when you go begging on the internet for money and most people won't donate because they don't like beggars. As for the funding part, I think people that donate money to a campaign on a crowdfunding are wasting their money. Most campaigns wil fail and there is no guarantee that you will get anything from your contribution. To me it would be analogous to going to Wal-Mart and buying a pen that doesn't exist in the store but hoping that someday they will sell it. If I give money to someone, I am expecting results. When I donate to charity I am under the impression that my donation will eventually go feed an underprivileged family or help an abused puppy, depending on who I'm donating to.\n\nLastly, since crowdfunding has gotten so big and anybody can start a crowdfunding campaign for just about anything, I think it takes away from true entrepreneurship and real ideas. Because crowdfunding is now more mainstreamed, just about anyone can go on and start a campaign for frivilous reason; \"I want to paint a portrait, give me money\" \"I want to travel to London for vacation, help me pay for the trip.\" The most recent example of a stupid frivilous crowdfunding campaign was [this guy who raised $55,000 to make potato salad.](http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/1/6880201/potato-stock-kickstarter-potato-salad-zack-danger-brown) He didn't have a revolutionary idea or a call to help out someone in dire need. All he wanted was potato salad. This kind of stuff puts me off from the whole idea of crowdfunding because now it seems like anyone can make up any reason to raise a few thousand dollars and people will be dumb enough to donate instead of standing up against bullshit projects.\n\nSo with my argument presented, I want someone to try to change my view, or at least give me reason to believe crowdfunding is a valid source to starting a business.", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: The suffering caused by the meat industry vastly outweighs its benefits, and as an institution is on a similar level to slavery. + \n + I am not using hyperbole - before you accuse me of being tasteless, note that I am *literally* making the statement that the meat industry is as morally abhorrent - if not moreso - than human slavery. Let me justify this:\n\nI can experience suffering, and my brain is the tool that allows me to do this. It follows that others who have a similar brain to me will have similar conscious experiences, and so can also suffer - when you see another human in pain, the reason you feel it should stop is that you can imagine the subjective experience of their suffering. We assume that similarity in brain structure creates similarity in subjective experiences.\n\nFrom this it follows that other beings who have similar brain mechanisms of feeling pain will also subjectively experience pain in a similar way to us. Neurologically, pain is managed by the [brain stem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem), which is one of the most primitive parts of the brain. Most of the animals that we eat, such as chickens, cows, and pigs have a brain stem of very similar structure to our own. They also react to pain in the same way (avoiding the source of the pain, trying to make it stop). So we can see that if we can assume that other humans have similar subjective experiences to our own due to similarities in neurology, we can extend this to other animals: While their subjective experiences will be markedly different to our own, the process of feeling pain is largely the same. ***So our brains are similar enough to those of most meat animals to assume that they feel pain in a similar way to us***. \n\nWhile it may be the case that some of the dumber meat animals such as chickens lack the mental capacity for fear, or other emotions typically associated with suffering, the experience of pain is essentially the same. An individual chicken may suffer less than an individual human in the same conditions, but the *scale* of the meat industry is so huge that, to a large extent, the suffering it causes outweighs any human concern. Roughly [9 *billion*](http://farmusa.org/statistics11.html) chickens are slaughtered each year in the USA *alone*. There is typically zero concern for the welfare of these chickens. [Debeaking without anaesthetic, hormone-driven unnaturally fast growth, and an excessively cruel slaughtering process](http://kb.rspca.org.au/What-are-the-welfare-issues-relating-to-meat-chicken-production_85.html) make the living conditions of these chickens indisputably hellish - and we already *know* that they essentially feel pain in the same way as us. \n\nIt's the sheer scale that matters - even if you think that a chicken can only suffer 0.1% (which I would argue is far too small) of what a human can go through, then you have the equivalent of 9 *million* humans in the USA dying in conditions that are probably worse than slavery *every year*.\n\nCompare this with the slave trade in the USA. In 1860 there were [4 million slaves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860_United_States_Census) in the USA. This wasn't the number of slaves dying every year - it was the number alive at any given point. So if we assume they had a life span of say, 35 years, you had about ~114,000 dying in the conditions of slavery - which is, according to the conservative estimate I gave above is *90 times less bad than the American chicken industry*. And that's *only* if you assume that meat chickens have an equal quality of life to slaves, which I highly doubt - slaves were never fed growth hormones and were not systematically slaughtered in exceptionally cruel ways. So you can see that with a fairly blunt but hardly unreasonable analysis, meat eating causes almost two orders of magnitude more suffering than slavery.\n\nThe only upside of meat is that it is tasty - tasty enough for its existence to improve people's quality of life by say, 10% (I think this is an overestimate, as I am a vegetarian and not particularly less happy than I was before). Consider an equivalent action that could improve people's life quality by 10% - such as giving everyone in the USA $50,000. Would *you* accept $50,000 if it meant reinstating slavery? I doubt it. You certainly wouldn't accept $50,000 for something that's nearly 100 times worse than slavery. Even if that number is way off the mark - even if we quartered it, or got an eighth of it - the suffering caused by the meat industry is *so huge* that it's simply not worth the payoff. I think that shows pretty plainly that meat is a morally disgusting act *at least* on the level of slavery, and should almost certainly be abolished.\n\nPlease note: I'm a firm utilitarian. Appeals to nature or rights are unlikely to change my mind on anything. Please talk about how eating meat makes the world a better place for those who live in it.", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV - Making our children believe that Santa Claus is real sends our kids the wrong message and teaches them that it's ok to lie. + \n + I've always thought it was a funny phenomenon that our society perpetuates this lie to our children for really no benefit at all. It's become a joke that when an adult becomes disillusioned by something, they compare it to when they \"first learned Santa wasn't real.\" And it may be a joke, but it's only funny because there is truth in it. There is real disillusionment in that moment when you first learn that Santa's not real, and there's a real feeling that you've been lied to, because - well - you have been lied to all your life by the very people you should trust the most. The only thing it teaches children is that it's ok to lie, your parents have lied to you all your life, and even society itself will go to great lengths to trick you. Find me one kid who wasn't crushed when they learned Santa wasn't real. \n\nNow I'm not saying that a kid's going to need to go into therapy over it or anything, and there are much worse things out there, but there is really no benefit to this lie at all. We might lie to our kids about other things - like when they first learn about death, you might tell them, \"No, I'm not going to die for a long, long time,\" even though that's obviously something nobody knows. But there's a very useful benefit to that lie. It calms your child's fears about death. They could develop all kinds of fears and neuroses if you didn't find a way to calm them, so it makes sense. The lie about Santa offers nothing.\n\nSome people will say that it helps foster their imagination, but I would say that, yes, stories like this and other fairy tales do help to foster a kid's imagination, but why do we need to go to such great lengths to convince our kids that he's real? We don't do this with other stories. We don't try to tell our kids that Hansel and Gretel were real kids, or that Spiderman exists, or that Daniel Radcliff really is a wizard. In fact, we often take the time to explain to them that Daniel Radcliff's just an actor, and Harry Potter can't really cast those spells, and all of that stuff is just movie magic. So why don't we do the same with Santa? We could still tell them the story, but why lie to them about it being real?\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

The same goes with voting, gun ownership, and alcohol consumption.\n\nI believe that terrorists, by depriving innocents of their rights, should also lose their rights. They have ignored their responsibilities to be decent human beings. Now, many may argue that \"Well, Scumbag Steve is also not being a decent human being!\" For the purposes of this argument, we'll define \"decent\" as not deliberately depriving civilians or innocents of rights.\n\nLet's define a terrorist. Merriam-Webster defines terrorism as: The use of violent acts to frighten the people in an area as a way of trying to achieve a political goal.\n\nWell, that's a bit vague. You could call any country's military terrorists. How about: \"The use of violent acts deliberately targeting civilians as the primary target to frighten...\"\nThat is what terrorists do. They bomb subways and buses. Crowded locations are their prime targets a majority of the time. Not military bases.\n\nThe accusation that Bush, the US military, etc. are terrorists is unfounded, because there is a difference between collateral damage as a result of war and terrorist attacks. Relatively speaking, the modern US military does a great job of avoiding civilian casualties. Look at how civilian centers were deliberately targeted during WWII by both sides compared to today (one could argue that the Israeli practices towards Palestinian civilians can be equatable to terrorism because they make no distinction between civilians and terrorists).\n\nPeople complain about waterboarding. I agree that pointless torture for the fun of it is wrong. Abu Gharib was wrong. But if that CIA operative has just cause to torture, because that information can help catch other terrorists or stop an attack, he or she should be able to do whatever he or she wants.\n\nAn individual should not be allowed to violate a prisoner for enjoyment. That might ruin his future usefullness as a source of information. \n\nAn individual acting on the orders of a government should be able to violate a prisoner for information. \n\nShould the prisoners get trials? Absolutely. I disagree with the current practice of holding them without trial. Innocent until proven guilty.

{"input": "CMV: I think that gender neutral pronouns such as Ze Zir and Zirs are counter productive and not feasible + \n + English comes with pronouns for binary genders. \nhe/his/him\nshe/her/hers\n\nIt is unfortunate that English doesn't have a gender neutral pronoun, because having gender binary built into the language can cause some problems and promote things like sexism or gender roles. \n\nNow there is this movement to create new gender neutral pronouns. \nze/zir/zirs\nFor several reasons I disagree with this movement:\n\nFirst of all, they sound pretty bad. Putting a hard sound into a pronoun (Z) takes something away from the shorthand purpose of pronouns. \n\nIt is unorganized. There are a few different spellings of these pronouns, which already makes it a little confusing. Also there are more pronouns to keep track of. It makes it more difficult to talk about people because you have to consciously keep in mind what pronouns you are using. I would have a lot of trouble adapting my speech for this while trying to have a serious conversation. \n\nIt creates more reasons for people to get offended. A huge problem with the modern advocacy groups for tolerance of other genders/sexuality is that they care so much about their labels. The difference between bisexual and pansexual (My internet spellchecker doesn't think that is a word btw) continues to change each time I ask someone. Protecting their labels becomes more important than seriously discussing issues. And when people mess up or forget to use the right words to describe someone, they get reprimanded for it. I think it is silly for people to get so up in arms about something so minor. You could say its cis-gender privilege, but I wouldn't give a shit if someone referred to me as \"her\" instead of \"him.\" \n\nSo overall I feel this movement is counter productive because it takes the focus off of the issues and onto the semantics, and I feel like it is not feasible because I really can't see the majority of people accepting these gender neutral pronouns as legitimate. Isn't it a little bit silly to demand that people refer to you as Zir and get offended if they don't want to use the recently invented word? \n\n...\n\n\nUsing they also provides other benefits, such as preventing the \"special little snowflake\" image from being applicable. I now more strongly feel that Ze Zir and Zirs are the wrong choice after hearing so many people get frustrated about those words and their implications. So my view didn't exactly change in the direction I thought they would, but I feel like I have found the solution that works best.

Basically, it prohibits insurance plans from automatically covering elective abortion, even in cases of rape or incest (cases in which the mother's life is in danger can be covered and are not affected by the act).  In order to have abortion covered by insurance, a separate rider would need to be purchased ahead of time.\n\nOpponents have labeled it a \"rape insurance\" law, and criticize it for blaming female rape victims for not planning ahead and purchasing rape insurance.\n\nI don't see it that way; the law isn't designed to punish or blame anybody.  It's designed to allow people who view elective abortion as murder to avoid paying for it through their insurance premiums.  If somebody doesn't view abortion as murder, and feels that it would be an appropriate option in any situation, then they have the ability to pay for the right to end that life by purchasing the separate rider.\n\nMy belief is centered on the opinion that a fetus is an individual human being with the inalienable right to life regardless of the mother's desire.  \n\n\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

If the only downside to explicit verbal consent is less sex, that's not so bad. No one *needs* sex. However, the downside to misreading signals and pressing on when the other party does not wish to is rape, which is awful. Between these two choices I can't help but prefer the first.\n\nThe only other downside I have heard is that \"it kills the mood\". But last night I asked my girlfriend explicitly for consent and she gave it verbally, even though we typically just assume the other is down for the dirty. And it didn't kill the mood at all! I believe this tactic would also be great for preventing false rape accusations. No more blurred lines, no more false claims. \n\nFinally, there has to be a clause where the consent must also be given while the consenter is in his/her right mind.

{"input": "CMV:Cannabis is a strong psychoactive substance and whether or not it is less dangerous than alcohol or tobacco has no bearing on its legality + \n + One of the key arguments for the decriminalisation and legalisation of cannabis (marijuana; active ingredient THC) is that it is no more dangerous than two currently legal drugs: alcohol and tobacco. \"Dangerous\" is a fluid term and may refer to mortality or morbidity or both, though I don't want this post to focus on this aspect of the aspect of the argument.\n\nI do not see what relevance the legality of alcohol/tobacco has on deciding whether a completely different substance should be freely available or not. Just because cannabis is potentially no more dangerous than other drugs does not mean it should be freely available. If anything, someone admitting that alcohol/tobacco are dangerous should be seeking to limit availability/legality of those drugs, not adding new ones to the mix.\n\nI hold this view because the legalisation of cannabis will add to the global health burden, and treatment of diseases associated with cannabis use will divert funds away from other areas.

{"input": "CMV: I think it is immoral for a transgender person to pursue anyone romantically without first disclosing their previous condition. + \n + My little brother had a rather strange night this past weekend. He had gotten flirty and physical with a woman at a bar in our hometown. The two of them kissed and made out a bit, and she gave him his number. They went out last night, and he called me afterwards to tell me that she was transgender. She disclosed this after she had given him head at her apartment.\n\nMy brother is very upset and beside himself. While I am an LGBT ally and a very sex positive person, my little brother is much more neutral on these issues, leaning more towards conservative ideals. He feels like he's been \"lied\" to and \"violated\", and I think he's right. \n\nMy argument is based on the assumption that a significant percentage of the population wouldn't otherwise have sex with a transgender person if that information were to be disclosed. Therefore, it is not moral for a transgender person to put someone at risk for taking actions they would otherwise regret. A transgender person is responsible for consent during sex that is fully informed. \n\nThere exists a very real, and I'd argue dominating, belief amongst the populace that having sex with a transgender man or woman isn't the same as having sex with a \"born\" man or woman. While the truth of this is matter is up for debate, \"truth\" in this situation is irrelevant. What is relevant is that a great deal (probably majority) of straight men and women wouldn't feel comfortable having sex with a transgender individual. This isn't necessarily \"fair\" or \"right\", but a fact that anyone, *especially* a transgender person who has been made to face those sorts of prejudices. \n\nTo not disclose this information is dishonest and wrong. By not disclosing this information, a transgender person is knowingly having sex with an individual who probably wouldn't be comfortable with it otherwise. While the cases are certainly not identical, this is akin to keeping sexual diseases a secret. Let's say I have herpes. I need to assume that a sizable, if not the majority, of people I want to sleep with would refuse to do so if I disclose this information. While some people might say, \"Herpes isn't a big deal, and if you don't have an outbreak my chances of getting it are low.

CMV + \n + Rothko (1903-1970) was a Latvian-American 'abstract-expressionist' painter, though he repeatedly rejected this label. He is most known for his geometric and rectangle-based paintings, such as [Rust and Blue](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5f/No_61_Mark_Rothko.jpg), [Magenta, Black, Green on Orange](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0c/%27Magenta%2C_Black%2C_Green_on_Orange%27%2C_oil_on_canvas_painting_by_Mark_Rothko%2C_1947%2C_Museum_of_Modern_Art.jpg), or [No.14](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Rothko_No_14.jpg/765px-Rothko_No_14.jpg).\n\nThis style of painting does not seem like it required much effort, which alone causes me to appreciate the art less. But to me, the actual art looks like only a bunch of different coloured rectangles, overlaid. I dislike this because it does not fulfill either a) sending a message or motif; or b) looking artistically pleasing and meaningful.\n\nThey are also known for being very large canvasses, and they are. Rothko is quoted as saying \"The reason I paint them [largely], however, [...] is precisely because I want to be very intimate and human.\" I do not see how these paintings, which are based around shapes (particularly rectangles), are any more humanizing than the work of other Abstract Expressionists such as Jackson Pollock.\n\nHe also discusses an 'experience' of sorts: \"The people who weep before my pictures are having the same religious experience I had when I painted them.

Perhaps they differentiate themselves from haters of race, sexual orientation, or gender because of their target's \"choice.\" But, religion is a choice, right? Westboro Baptist hates people who have made an unhealthy religious choice, in their eyes. The KKK hates Catholics and Jews (supposedly the religious definition, too). These traditional hate groups drape their fanaticism of others' choices in altruism, too.\n\nIt reminds me of the proponents of the War on Drugs or abortion restrictions.

{"input": "CMV: We need to be more tolerant of racism. + \n + Yes, you read that right, and here's what I mean:\n\nNot all racism. Not actual serious racist beliefs or acts. But instead the jokes we're uncovering people telling each other, trying to prevent people form using the 'n word', trying to uncover those villainous, secret racists at every turn if they date to say one thing that sound remotely insensitive, etc. This is not a good thing, in fact I think it's quite bad. Trying to weed out and crucify not just what people do, but what people think, actually gets a little Orwellian. \n\nI think most of what you see today is not people who rationally believe one race is inferior, but moreso people who are just angry, pissed off people, and hatred fills a vacuum. Or perhaps people who don't rationally believe one race is inferior, but still engage in it because it provides them some emotional satisfaction. A lot of it also seems to be an abstract hatred, rather than a hatred of people they personally have connected with in some way.\n\nIt's also true that when you hate someone, you hate everything about them. Even the most innocuous acts become part of your hate: \"Look at the way she got up and walked to the bathroom. What a bitch.\" I've often argued that many conservatives don't hate Obama *because* he is black, but simply hate the opposition so much that they hate everything about them, including his blackness. As someone who dabbled in conservative/Libertarian thinking, to the point where intellectual opposition mixed with passion turned to anger toward those opposed, I started to realize the line between, \"I disagree with the views of the party which is supported by minorities,\" to, \"Damn minorities are ruining everything!\" is shorter than one likes to think. \n\nIf I still have a real dislike, it's not for a skin color, it's for social justice warriors and do-gooddery. I see it as so self-righteous, and oppressive in it's own way. Nothing makes me want to shout \"Ni@@er!\" (I think it's sad that I can't even write the damn word without expecting my post won't be excepted in *a debate about the word*!) more than being told I'm never, ever allowed to use that word by someone else. It's strikes a core nerve in me to go, \"Oh yeah? Who are you to tell me what is right to say or do?\"\n\nAnd I have used that word, let's talk about some context: In my car. I dunno about you, but there are few base joys they lift you from a bad day than giving yourself an excuse to feel superior to another driver. Most people wouldn't label someone a terrible person for grumbling about a driver that cut them off in traffic. That person may not be any worse a driver than you on whole, but for now, they're just the asshole who cut you off. In the comfort of my own car, I'm free. I can say anything I want to say, and it's liberating. And the more base reason I have for that pleasurable chemical release the coincides with imagining myself feeling superior to another human being for that short time, the better. The easiest are sex, race, and age. I often like to string expletives together. \"Bitch ass negro,\" is a good one (I don't even know if the driver is black or female, it just feels good). \n\nI also often love to play off the fact that \"gay\" or \"faggot\" has developed so interestingly in our society. To me and Eminem, those words don't actually apply to gay people, although I think it's [Louis C.K.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fcja4WFFzDw) who pretty much nailed the dichotomy (Chris Rock has a similar line). I often like to even go the other way with it, so if someone is, as Louie says, acting 'like a faggot,' say something like, \"I found that action to be rather homosexual in nature.\" Or at least, I'd like to be able to say that more readily, if I didn't have to worry about the political correctness police, who have successfully invaded society to the extent that you actually have to worry about your job and life if you said that, jumping on me for it. That is *not* a good thing.\n\nThe recent Sigma Alpha Epsion frat video with the racist chant that's been going around makes me think too. I think we should be easier on them. Yes, there were being assholes, but they were being assholes as a fun thing in their own private setting. If every inappropriate and 'I'm going to hell for this' joke my friends and I have told in the comfort of our own homes were recorded for others to see, it would be a treasure trove. \n\nAlso, I dunno if anyone else remembers being a teenage boy like I do, but teenage boys talk shit to make themselves seem cooler and tougher. I remember when I was in Jr High and the OJ Simpson case was big news, and exchange between two friends went something like this: \"Actually, I thought Nicole Brown was pretty cute.\" \"Yeah, but she did marry a *negro*\" \"Yeah, she deserved to die just for that.\" - pretty damning, huh? I can just see that as a huge news story if someone today caught it on video. But I feel like it would create a cognitive dissonance in many who don't get it that those same guys, when faced with, say, a black guy on the street who looked like he was hurt, wouldn't hesitate to be decent human beings and help, but it's true. If you can't figure out how that is possible, then you're missing part of how human beings interact. \n\nI feel the same way about a lot of the emails that have been 'exposed', like ones talking about what movie Obama would like. I see it as two people making joking with each other. Bottom line, I think if we're really going to live in a society where everything we say and do is exposed for others to scrutinize, we have to gain some better understanding or how people behave, and become more, not less, tolerant of such 'racism'.", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

Additionally, I am distrustful of concentrations of power in the public and the private spheres. Despite this, I still think there needs to be a governing force. First off, I am unsure how major social changes will be made and how there will be a safety net without a government. What I mean by a safety net is programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, what is remaining of welfare, and food stamps/SNAP program. I realize there is something called mutual aid, but I wonder if this is enough. I just don't understand how there can be a push forward for a better world, a better community. I even support taxes as well, and think that they are necessary despite their forceful nature of physical coercion upon people. Aristotle said in The Politics that a humans cannot exist without a state, and if they don't participate in a state then then things descend into anarchy and chaos. I guess my major issue is that I don't see how a society and a country could function without a government. \n\nIt seems that if there was no government, one would arise eventually with all of its hierarchies. In other words, I am saying a government is inevitable or at least that's how I feel. On top of this, I believe that despite all of the bureaucracy involved, that their should be regulators on the beat that are holding big business accountable. Let me also note that I'm also not in support of privatization either as a solution, and even at times I seem tempted to defend nationalization of certain industries. \n\nSo I struggle between this distrust of authority I have and thinking that the state can do good things for society. Am I wrong? I know this is a lot to unpack and address, but I wanted to be explicit as possible. Thank you for listening and reading. I would love to hear all of your views on this important question.  \n\nUPDATE: One commenter noted that I made it seem like the state is opposed to capitalist behavior. That is not what I meant at all. Instead, I know that the state is meant to protect the upper class in a society. In the US, this was done since the time of the traditional founders. In human history, this has been done since the beginning in general. At the same time, I currently believe that the state can help the populace in a society.

{"input": "CMV: We will never travel space in any meaningful way because we'll use up all of our resources long before that + \n + Now I don't know all of the details on some of this, which is why I'm hoping someone will change my view.  But ever since reading about [The Great Filter,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter) I started to question my assumption that it's inevitable that the human race will expand into outer space and begin to colonize other worlds.  So here are what I see are the biggest hurdles to humanity colonizing space, and why I think we won't overcome them.\n\nHurdle #1: AFAIK, oil is the most energy-dense resource we have.  And we use it for pretty much everything, including rocket fuel, manufacture, transportation, you name it. Once we use it up, we don't really have a good substitute to get us into space.  Nuclear seems like an option, but without oil I don't know how difficult it would be to extract and refine fissile material in the quantities that would be needed.\n\nHurdle #2: From what I understand, we've pretty much extracted all of the low-hanging fruit as far as oil goes.  We're having to drill deeper and in more remote places to get oil.  In fact there are theories that if some catastrophic event were to occur right now, we'd never be able to get back to this point technology-wise, because we'll no longer have the capacity or ability to reach oil.  It's just too difficult to get to without our current technology.  \n\nHurdle #3: We're in our infancy as far as space travel goes.  How much effort, resources, and money would it take to establish a lunar colony?  I feel like that's doable, but if we really want to expand into space, any colonies we establish must be self-sufficient, and I can't see how that's possible with our current technologies.  I'm not even sure we know how to do that right now.  Expansion into space in any meaningful way rests on the idea that eventually we'll find other resources out there to sustain ourselves.  But how long will it take to find those?  \n\nHurdle #4: Space travel seems like a low priority for humanity right now.  I mean, we can't even take care of ourselves.   In most of the western world, quarterly profits seem to be the highest priority, without any thought for the future.  Consumer culture means, above everything else, consumption of oil in one way or another, which leads us back to hurdle #2. Okay, I really don't want this to get political, and I don't want to cast too many sweeping generalizations.  So I guess I feel that space travel and expansion could be possible, but it would require all of humanity working together in a way that I don't think is feasible right now.  Basically, as a species we're just too immature.\n\nSo as you can see, I'm making a lot of assumptions, mainly:\n\n* without oil there will be no space travel\n\n* given how difficult it is to extract oil, and given our rate of consumption, it won't be too long before we run out.\n\nI don't know; it just kind of bums me out.  Right now I feel like any future we've envisioned for ourselves in space is just fantasy, and will never come to pass.

If someone wants to say \"Although I am experiencing great success, I am still humble\", that is ok. However, even that can be a problem as people describing themselves as humble very often imply that that is some great characteristic about themselves, defeating the word (the ironic phrase \"I'm probably the most humble person on Earth\" comes to mind). The only other context someone might describe themselves as \"humbled\" would be if they actually *were* properly humbled; e.g. they lost their house, car, and job and had to actually humble themselves by resorting to begging or a less dignified job, thus becoming \"humbled\". Outside of that context, I believe every usage of a person describing themselves as being \"humbled\" by some opportunity to be not only inaccurate, but polar opposite to what is meant by the word.

If I'm wrong in this,* please *help me see that; I honestly can't, right now, and as much as I believe everything I've described below, I can't help but feel like an awful person for writing off the value of an entire culture. I'd appreciate any constructive feedback. Thank you.*\n\nThe Jewish history is a history of genocide... perpetrated by the Jewish people, upon their smaller and weaker neighbors--and occasionally, by virtue of exceptional military leadership, against larger and conventionally stronger neighbors. This goes back to ancient times, but is clearly true in the present day; Israelis are gathering in public places by the hundreds, if not thousands, dancing and singing things like \"There are no children left in Gaza, Oleh!\"\n\nThe Palestinians are the modern-day descendants of the Philistines. The Israelis are simply perpetuating an agenda of ethnic cleansing that is thousands of years old. This is how the Israelis act, displaying overwhelming support (suggestions place public support for the ground campaign in Gaza as high as 87%; since when does 87% of any public support anything its government does?) for genocidal endeavors.\n\nThis lasts until they come up against somebody too strong for them to defeat alone, at which point it's \"poor Israelis\" and \"persecuted Jews.\" World War II? The Holocaust was horrible. I'd agree. Thank God we'll never forget all the Gypsies, the homosexuals, the mentally disabled, and other groups that the Nazis persecuted. \n\nY'know how they made the homosexuals wear pink triangles, so they'd stand out from their neighbors and could be singled out for relocation and persecution?\n\nWait, you didn't know that? Well, there's no surprise. God forbid that the Holocaust be about anyone else but the Jewish people. I don't know how the history books read in other countries; in America, nobody mentions anyone but the Jews. There are no photographs of anyone else being persecuted. Pink triangles pinned to homosexuals? Shit, even a college education over here isn't guaranteed to go into that, but I knew what a \"Star of David\" was when I was four years old, and why it is so awful that Hitler did what he did to those poor Jewish people (and it is awful, beyond awful; don't get me wrong). \n\nWhat about Jewish rituals?\n\nKosher food is considered pure. Y'know why? It's because the animals are killed by being first immobilized, then having their necks cut approximately halfway through with a slow sawing motion. The animal is left to bleed out in pain, as Jewish tradition holds that the slow bleeding out and suffering of the animal renders the meat somehow \"pure.\" \n\nLiterally, \"the suffering adds flavor\" (and, probably, another thing that was necessary thousands of years ago for health reasons, that is no longer necessary, but is one of those mindless traditions that is indulged in for the sake of being \"time-honored;\" in the case of Jewish tradition, however, this seems to pass from 'quaint' to 'sickeningly horrifying' without much exception). \n\nJewish culture is stuck in the mindset of a world that is thousands of years gone, when it was literally \"kill or be killed\" for every little tribe on the planet, and a few hundred people dead could mean the end of your ethnic group. The Jews lost 6,000,000 in WWII and are currently a stronger force than they have ever before been in human history, within living memory of the Holocaust... but they don't seem to have gotten that message. Small wonder, perhaps, given that they're likely fairly indignant at how the lesser races of treated them.\n\nJews all but invented the concept of the \"master race.\" They have a word for people who aren't Jewish--*gentile*. Now, this isn't so distinct from other religious groups in some fashion; southern Baptists routinely refer to other people as \"nonbelievers\" and Muslims have the famous \"infidel,\" but terms like these tend to have something in common: they denote *other people* as being *ideologically wrong* in the viewpoint of the individuals using said terminology. This is not the case with \"gentile,\" the Jews don't *want* to convert you. You aren't *pure*. Gentile denotes people who are, in Jewish tradition, physically inferior--as is also evidenced by their use of \"Jewish\" to describe themselves as a religious faith, as a political state, and as an *ethnicity*. Even the most hardcore Christians don't identify themselves as being \"ethnically\" Christian; in fact, they'd vehemently deny it, stating that a person must be individually \"saved\" to be Christian. \n\nNot so the Jews. They're superior, everybody else is inferior, and they don't even particularly *like* it when someone wants to convert. And if nobody's actually giving them a hard time? They'll make it up; ample evidence suggests that the Jews were never enslaved by the Egyptians; it's generally accepted that the Bible story of the enslavement is a complete fabrication. The Pyramids were built by Egyptian farmers and craftspeople who were paid for their labors and well taken care of, and there is no sign of the economic collapse that would have occurred had a million slaves walked out of Egypt overnight.\n\nIt is possible to honor your ancestors and revere those who fell in times of horrifying carnage and catastrophe without using it to justify an ongoing tradition of genocide, barbarism, and delusions of physiological superiority. Yet, not only are the Israelis not doing this, but we (America) are aiding and abetting them in their ongoing vileness. These people are targeting individual wheelchair-bound people with helicopter rockets, and beaches of small children with warships, and we're paying to refill their ammunition stockpiles. It leaves me feeling positively sick.\n\nThey are literally one moral step away from walking into peoples' living rooms and skinning their children alive, or from sacrificing people to God, but you can't say anything bad about the Jews. Have you ever noticed that? \"I don't much care for the Japanese/Indians/Mexicans/Hispanic people/black people\" or whoever, and you're at least given a chance to explain, but \"I don't like the Jewish people\" makes you an instant monster.\n\n\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

Probably shouldn't have to say this though since the /r/changemyview community is *usually* pretty mature with their responses.\n\nWikipedia states that \"Users who receive high ratings may be notified by email that they are in the 'top half of OkCupid's most attractive users' and 'will now see more attractive people in [their] match results'. The email also reads 'And, no, we didn't just send this email to everyone on OkCupid. Go ask an ugly friend and see'.\n\nFirst off, I personally believe attractiveness is subjective-different people prefer different things. Some might think curly hair is ugly, some may think its pretty. Some may think tatoos are sexy, some may think they look stupid. Some may prefer blonde hair, some may prefer black hair. These things, while people may share different opinions, should still not make too big of a difference due to things averaging out.\n\nHowever, other things may not average out so well. For example, females with a flat chest/smaller body(for lack of a better term) are considered unattractive by most men. However, there are some men who find this physical feature quite attractive. But because this is likely a minority opinion, women with this physical characteristic may receive low ratings, and as a result, not show up in results to attractive men with this particular preference. There are plenty of factors in which a minority of people may find attractive, whereas most would find unattractive. Point being, I feel like beauty is, to a degree, subjective, and simply matching the people that are voted most attractive isn't the best way to ensure lasting relationships.\n\nSecondly, setting the threshold to 50% means that it will result in poor self esteem for for those that don't receive it. If you don't receive the message, it implies you're in the bottom 50%, thus 'below average', and therefore ugly. The message also seems to take a rather ill-mannered tone. The lack of receiving this message can result in greater depression. I'm not saying that people shouldn't own up to accept the bad things about them, and deal with their problems, but I don't think OKCupid needs to run their system in a way that reminds everyone of it. Changing the threshhold to something like 80% or 90% would result in positive reinforcement for those who receive it, without it being too negative if you don't receive it.\n\nLastly, it creates a narrow way of searching for a \"compatible\" SO.

Why keep the name, why not Thoritta, or what ever stupid cheesy name you'd like but not Thor (or a good name ... that could also work). Sure this way it'll sell more, but it's stupid.

Is it just me or is that just a stupid way of phrasing that ? Wouldn't \"Like you're clean ?\" be more natural, less stiff ?\n\nDc Comics: Red Hood: Starfire, just Starfire. She can't tell humans apart ? she is a human in just about every important way, nor can she remember names, but what ever. The way the writers make her wanting sex all the time just because \"fan service\" (she sees no difference between humans, she does not remember them, nor recolonize them ... but sex!!! God, they ruined the animated version of her T_T), that is horrible. Then the ret-con about her lying (she actually does remember them ... stupid).\n\nDc Comics: Teen Titans: The culling ... just horrible in of itself.\n\nAlso I have never seen a comic being smart, usually it's writers trying to be smart. I don't even know what else to say. But I'd like to discuss.\n\nP.S. Am I the only one who just can't stand \"The world's greatest detective\" when talking about batman.

I'm not considering the price of the content. If only the price makes the pirated version \"better\", then the two versions of this content are considered equal.

This can be due to usability (such as the always-on DRM that makes the content unusable in certain circumstances), accessibility (such as series that are released in other countries after a long time, or even never at all), or for any other reason other than pricing. \n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

That, if you assume they would live a happy life, it would be better for them to live than to not live. That it's better to have a happy existence than no existence at all, and killing someone is depriving them of all the happiness they would have had had they not been killed.\n\nHowever, I don't see why this same argument should not apply to unborn, nonexistent people as well. I'm not just talking about unborn fetuses, but also about people who haven't been conceived. If it's better to live than to not live, why isn't it wrong to *not* create as much life as possible? Surely it would be better for someone to be alive than not alive? Surely people would rather live than not have lived at all?\n\nI have yet to see a reason why once someone is born (or, from some perspectives, conceived) the potential life they have suddenly becomes important. I understand that obviously there's a big difference (they are now alive and weren't before), but I don't see why, from an ethical perspective, that should change the value of their future life. Before they were born they had many years of potential future life, and once they are alive they still have many potential years of future life; why does already being alive add value to that potential future?\n\nThis leads me to the conclusion that every child one could have but doesn't is equivalent to killing a person, because you are depriving them of the life they could have had.

{"input": "I've believe that the Liberals are 'wrong' regarding US economic and fiscal policy. Also Krugman is a hack. CMV + \n + First a bit on Krugman. Ranting non-stop about the failure of austerity in Britain and elsewhere doesn't justify the argument for increased stimulus spending as a general policy. Uncompetitive economies which don't have the exorbitant privilege of controlling the world's reserve currency can't engage in Quantitative Easing or other money printing shenanigans without risking massive inflation and sharp increases in interest rates.  \n\nFor the US in particular, I find contemporary liberal thinking regarding economic policy to be severely misguided. Rising costs associated with means-tested welfare programs, Medicare/Medicaid, Social Security, are rising at unsustainable levels which cannot be mitigated through military cuts or increased tax revenue. Deep cuts to entitlements are necessary.\n\nOn the tax issue, I really don't understand people's support for higher *income* taxes for the top brackets. The rates for &gt;$193000 combined household income are most painful for educated professionals while hardly affecting the 'truly rich'. The rich make the majority of their their money though investment. Why do liberals never advocate for higher capital gains tax or higher estate taxes? Do they hate doctors/engineers more than they hate fund managers and their clients?\n\nOnto matters of stimulus and spending. The vast majority of the American workforce has been uncompetitive for the past 20 years and yet, hasn't experienced a significant decrease in quality of life. The first reason is globalized cheap labor allowing for multinationals to cut overhead and subsidize US costs of living. The second reason is deficit spending to support state/federal wages and social programs. The US can afford to run this deficit a lot longer than other countries with the dollar as the reserve currency and the US being the lender of last resort. That combined with current uncertainty in the world economy allows for the US to commit atrocities such as TARP, QEternity, and debt monetization without risk of inflation or rising interest rates...for now. \n\nThe fundamental problem is the fact that vast swathes of the US are no different from Greece. To say nothing about subsidized government jobs, there is no demographic more unproductive/uncompetitive than inner-city urban populations which are growing faster relative to every other demographic save for unskilled hispanic immigrants. These systemic problems can't be solved stimulus of any kind. Massive investment in infrastructure is good in theory, but construction would most likely be slow and hindered by prohibitive labor costs while finished projects might not even derive much utility. \n\nThe US can probably maintain its current trajectory for another decade before the rest of the world leaves the dollar. The US can do what they did to Japan in the 80s and what Japan is doing now and continue to devalue its currency, but this eats away at household savings and income; the former already depleted and the latter having already stagnated for decades. \n\nIt seems abundantly clear that the US is running out of borrowed time. Severe economic pain and rebalancing will occur and there does not exist a policy which will prevent it, only one that will slightly lessen it. Conservatives have stumbled across the right policy, but are mistaken if they expect significant economic growth. Even with housing inventory depleted, growth will probably remain &lt;3% and unlikely to benefit most of the population.

There will be no market for many types of labor.  3) Many people won't be capable of performing any type of labor for which there is a market.  4) the market for labor is basically over at this point.

If i could restate the Title to where it could fit I would put:\n\n\n**I Believe that Things such as Social Media,  Video games, 24 hour news, the internet and calculators have grown to a level to where they are causing more harm than good, and are destroying our society and replacing the thought process and ability for humans to comprehend, and morally think for themselves.**\n\n\nPoints for my argument are:\n\n\n**Calculators:** The accessibility of graphing calculators in middle school, and high school can be used to be able to think on a much higher level than we used too, but are hardly used for that reason, the average kid from ages of 12-20 use calculators for simple Addition, Subtraction, multiplication, and division. This is causing the brain to not think for its self and become lazy, and also dumber as a whole with out calculators. Leaving the average 5th grader to be smarter at mental math then high school kids (As masses, not PRE-AP or AP students, because they are only about 10% Of the whole picture)\n\n\n\n\n**Video games:** The amount of time kids use playing video games is destructive to our society, they do not allow the kid to get any exercise, or exercise the brain in the moderation they are used today. We have came to the point where instead of parenting out children, we stick them in front of a TV because it easier to have them distracted instead to discipline a child. Because Technology has once again found a way to replace human innovative thought, with a detraction.\n\n\n**24 hour news:** If you are to compare journalism 30 years ago, to journalism today, you see that our mainstream way of obtaining news is filth. Most of it is just repetitive ga-ga.Even in the hugest stories, there isn't enough going on to necessitate constant coverage. 9/11, the Russian conflict going on, all of these were major major stories, but when viewed through 24 hour coverage you get a lot of the same stuff rehashed over and over again. Just touch on the main points and let us know when there's new information. That's all we need.\nMost of 24 news ends up being commentary from people whose opinions shouldn't matter anyway. I also think it makes us over analyze potential world leaders and there personal lives, so we vote for the person who appears to look the best, not vote for the person who may not look the best, but makes the best decisions.\n\n\n**The Internet:**  Things like social media, netflix, reddit, all ingulf peoples lives to where everything is accessible to us. What does the common teenager do when they are bored? Check facebook, instagram, twitter. What do they do again when they look through all of those and are still bored? Check all of them, again. This generation that is growing up right now, will be the fall of society, because everything is expected to be instant, and in front of them. \n\n\n\nThe ability to  access information is amazing, everything can be so helpful and useful, but I believe we have gone to far. We constantly are improving technology like the above stated, trying to get \"Better and better!\" But When is enough, enough? I believe we have already hit there, because the generation that is growing up is loosing the ability to think rationally and for themselves.

Darth Vader is also guilty of this, routinely killing Imperial officers. So does the Joker in the Dark Knight, and this actually almost goes wrong for him. \n\nAll three of these examples represent slightly different reasons for killing your henchmen, but I think each one is poor form. In the case of the Ninja Turtles villain, actions like that engender dissent and create a culture of fear and paranoia among your henchmen. I mean those guys just had to hold down their coworker and watch him die, how do they know it's not going to be them next time? If anything would inspire me to quit or revolt, that would definitely be up there.\n\nIn the case of Darth Vader, he kills Imperial officers for failing him, which stifles creativity and likely costs him a lot of high quality officers. The Empire is fighting an insurgency and as recent events in Afghanistan showed, mistakes are going to be made, and it's difficult work. I suspect that the reason Vader is constantly saddled with incompetent officers is that he killed all the competent ones long ago and now no one wants to work with him. Also the Empire clearly doesn't promote based on merit, because Vader immediately promotes a guy after the first time we see him kill someone, and that guy sucked just as much.\n\nIn the case of the Joker, his plan almost backfires as it's happening.

Go seek a job where your employer isn't a constant source of danger.\n\nMachiavelli said that if you can't be loved and feared, it's better to be feared, but he touted Cesare Borgia as a great leader, and that guy died naked and alone of a stab wound. The only case where I think killing your henchmen makes sense is shooting deserters in the middle of a pitched battle, as that encourages continued fighting in the moment over desertion in an \"over the top\" kinda situation.

{"input": "I don't believe men should have the right to abandon their child. CMV. + \n + So, this is a pretty popular topic on Reddit, and personally, as a male, I don't believe men should have the right to abandon their child. I commonly see it proposed as a matter of balancing the birth control rights of women to have an abortion, but I see this as flawed.\n\nFirst and foremost, abandonment is in no way whatsoever equivalent to abortion. Abortion absolves both individuals of parental responsibilities. Abandonment only benefits the father. It does nothing to help the child, and in almost all cases will just increase their suffering. Personally, I find it offensive when people call abandonment \"financial abortion\" because it is an obvious and deceitful use of language to try and equivocate 2 things that are inherently unequal. \"Child Divorce\" is a far more accurate term, though really that still comes off as just a less offensive way to dress up abandonment.\n\nSecondly, it is commonly said that the \"man's choice\" is whether or not to have sex, and I actually agree with this. Sexual intimacy is able to be achieved through means other than vaginal intercourse, so I personally find no value in an argument that telling men this is punishing them for their sexuality. Our culture is deeply aware of the consequences of sex, and since men do not have an equivalent option to abortion, we must accept that our personal responsibility for pregnancy lies within a different step in the process.\n\nPregnancy and parenthood are extremely taxing on individuals, and I can sympathize with men who suffer in circumstances that are beyond their control, but I fail to see how child abandonment serves to balance the situation. In my view it only creates another grossly skewed set of circumstances, only this time solely in favor of the father. For the purposes of this discussion, I will be willing to give a delta not only if you can change my mind on this larger issue, but on either of the sub-issues I have identified in my previous paragraphs.\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: I think that states should be allowed to tax goods that are manufactured from other states within the US + \n + Hi Folks,\n\nTaxation is a complicated subject.  It is used for many things.  One of the things we use taxation for is to protect goods grown/made/located in our community, guiding how your community spends its money and as a sort of punishment to other communities.\n\nLets take an example, in Norway there are massive taxes on cars.  It is based on a few things, but long story short, a car that costs $30,000 USD in the US could cost $90,000 USD in Norway.  They tax based on a few things, one is engine size.\n\nThis is used to punish people for being wasteful (inefficient cars, cars which pollute more) and also to make electric cars much more affordable since they are almost completely untaxed.  This is one of the reasons that Norway has the largest number of electric cars per capita (1% of the population, where US is 0.07% of the population).  This system would utterly collapse if, say, cars could be sold from outside of Norway to people in Norway without abiding by these taxes.\n\nNow this is not something I am asking for your agreement on.  This is just a reality, taxes CAN be used this way and some places do.  Whether you agree in principal of using it like this is not what I am asking.\n\nI see the world as hundreds of countries/states running small experiments on how to build a country.  Some of these are succeeding and others are not.  Countries must be able to control their experiments without being subverted from outside.\n\nNow certainly the states are not individual countries, but the inability to tax other states goods is also holding back states that are attempting to adopt ideas that effectively are more expensive, but also more \"fair\" (I realize after posting this isn't a good phrase, I should say more expensive, but the community has decided to give it a shot, and they should be allowed to conduct that experiment without complete subversion from other communities).\n\nFor example, if you raise the minimum wage in one state, raise taxes or other things in order to support a system, many companies threaten to relocate(assuming they can) or close.  They did this sort of stuff with the Affordable Health Act (though I don't know how many actually followed through).  Now companies should have the liberty to move and relocate.  But I also think that if a company moves to exploit the lower wages, less regulation, less social services, etc of another area, that the original state has a right to tax that company based on these factors.\n\nNow this certainly is not a straight forward thing.  But just as we allow Norway to tax cars being brought in from other countries, the citizens of each state should be allowed to guide their communities as well.  Maybe some states will decide not to, sure thats fine, but if you want to you should be able to, at least in some ways.", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "I believe that /r/conspiracy should be a default subreddit. CMV + \n + I first started browsing /r/conspiracy in June when snowden's revelations were coming out. A week later, Michael Hastings was reported to have died in a car crash.\n\nMichael Hastings was an investigative journalist whose piece on General Stanley McChrystal and the War in Afghanistan led to McChrystal's resignation. As a result of his work, he received several death threats from McChrystal's aides. 3 hours before his car crashed and exploded, he emailed several of his friends telling them he believed he was being investigated by the fbi, was onto a big story, and needed to go off the radar for a while.\n\nThe LAPD declared his death to be a suicide, and the msm called alternative accounts of what happened to him conspiracy theories. There is a pervasive double standard which accompanies the phrase conspiracy theory.\n\nOne example of this double standard is the Boston Bombing. The FBI is charging Jahar with conspiracy and they have yet to prove his guilt. Regardless, you are not going to hear the theory \"Jahar and Tamerlan did the boston bombing acting alone\" referred to as a conspiracy theory by the msm. \n\nI think that keeping an open mind means being willing to examine all possibilities, and that requires investigating whether conspiracy theories are true or not.\n\nConspiracy theorists are often caricatured as being delusional, crazy, or falling prey to logical fallacies like confirmation bias. I do not think this is more true of conspiracy theorists than any other group of people. If one rules out the possibility of conspiracy from the get-go, then one is also falling prey to confirmation bias. I also think that anyone that isn't paranoid about government surveillance at this point is delusional or benefits from it in some way or another.\n\n/r/conspiracy is a diverse community. You will find libertarians there and you will find communists there. Pretty much the only political view you won't find represented there is neoconservativism, which has a lot to do with 9/11. Different people believe different theories, and as a result there is plenty of internal skepticism and debate, which is very important to successfully wading through conspiracy theories and facts.\n\nI think that /r/conspiracy should be a default subreddit because there are a lot of true conspiracy theories, including ones that are currently maligned and ridiculed by the mainstream. A lot of people that don't think 9/11 was an inside job may not have spent much time reading about it. They also may have only encountered false, dumb, or largely irrelevant theories and facts, many of which are being deliberately spread as disinformation to distract from the more important ones. They also may think that people like [Alex Jones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_jones) are more representative of this theory than people like [Immortal Technique](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrQSAkaWsaU), KRS-One, Yasiin Bey, Chuck D, [Aaron McGruder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_mcgruder), or [Sibel Edmonds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibel_Edmonds).\n\nIf /r/conspiracy were on the front page of reddit it would mean that more people would have exposure to conspiracy-related material. Perhaps some people initially skeptical of conspiracy theories like \"9/11 was an inside job\" will change their mind.\n\nIt would also be beneficial for the people who frequent /r/conspiracy to have the subreddit be on the front page, because it would increase our engagement with those that are less familiar with specific conspiracies as well as those who are more skeptical of conspiracy theory in general. Perhaps we will change our minds about some things as well.\n\nAll in all, /r/conspiracy is a vibrant community which discusses material very relevant to contemporary affairs, and I believe that having it on the front page would encourage dialogue and open-mindedness within the subreddit as well as on reddit as a whole.", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: I think moral laws can be established by logic &amp; science and would be preferable than those currently established by faith and cultural norms. + \n + I first came across this idea when I heard of Sam Harris. I'll quote from him \n\n\"Morality and values depend on the existence of conscious minds -- and specifically on the fact that such minds can experience various forms of well-being and suffering in this universe. Conscious minds and their states are natural phenomena, of course, fully constrained by the laws of Nature (whatever these turn out to be in the end). Therefore, there must be right and wrong answers to questions of morality and values that potentially fall within the purview of science. On this view, some people and cultures will be right (to a greater or lesser degree), and some will be wrong, with respect to what they deem important in life.\"\n\nI guess ultimately this is a very utilitarian moral philosophy, essentially replacing good with wellbeing. I think the concept of wellbeing is much easier to quantify and operationalise than 'good', as good is much more vaguely defined than wellbeing, which looks more at individuals than whole situations. \n\nHe answers two initial criticism in his article here http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sam-harris/a-response-to-critics_b_815742.html \n\nI'd try to at least flick through the article before replying with an attempting at changing my view. I think he addresses the problems of measuring wellbeing pretty well in the article, and what he calls the persuasion problem as well, although if you think you can expand on the argument go ahead.\n\nI've heard this fellow Sam wants to Nuke all Muslim countries or something, I don't think that, I just think that there is a better way to determine morality than scripture (rubbish), trying to figure out what god wants through observing nature (Aristotle and all western religions as far as I'm aware) or just relying on tradition and cultural norms (the only other alternative to science and logic I can think of).\n\nI guess pure nihilism is one position you could take (although arguably this is something addressed by Harri in the section on the problem of persuasion) plus I don't think anybody is really a nihilist when it comes to the crunch. \n\n\n\nI've included this quote from the article incase you can't read through it\n\n\"It seems to me that there are three, distinct challenges put forward thus far:\n\n1. There is no scientific basis to say that we should value well-being, our own or anyone else's. (The Value Problem)\n\n2. Hence, if someone does not care about well-being, or cares only about his own and not about the well-being of others, there is no way to argue that he is wrong from the point of view of science. (The Persuasion Problem)\n\n3. Even if we did agree to grant \"well-being\" primacy in any discussion of morality, it is difficult or impossible to define it with rigor. It is, therefore, impossible to measure well-being scientifically. Thus, there can be no science of morality. (The Measurement Problem)\n\nI believe all of these challenges are the product of philosophical confusion. The simplest way to see this is by analogy to medicine and the mysterious quantity we call \"health.\" Let's swap \"morality\" for \"medicine\" and \"well-being\" for \"health\" and see how things look:\n\n1. There is no scientific basis to say that we should value health, our own or anyone else's. (The Value Problem)\n\n2. Hence, if someone does not care about health, or cares only about his own and not about the health of others, there is no way to argue that he is wrong from the point of view of science. (The Persuasion Problem)\n\n3. Even if we did agree to grant \"health\" primacy in any discussion of medicine, it is difficult or impossible to define it with rigor. It is, therefore, impossible to measure health scientifically. Thus, there can be no science of medicine. (The Measurement Problem)\n\nWhile the analogy may not be perfect, I maintain that it is good enough to obviate these three criticisms. Is there a Value Problem, with respect to health? Is it unscientific to value health and seek to maximize it within the context of medicine? No. Clearly there are scientific truths to be known about health -- and we can fail to know them, to our great detriment. This is a fact. And yet, it is possible for people to deny this fact, or to have perverse and even self-destructive ideas about how to live. Needless to say, it can be fruitless to argue with such people. Does this mean we have a Persuasion Problem with respect to medicine? No. Christian Scientists, homeopaths, voodoo priests, and the legions of the confused don't get to vote on the principles of medicine. \"Health\" is also hard to define -- and, what is more, the definition keeps changing. There is no clear \"metric\" by which we can measure it, and there may never be one -- because \"health\" is a suitcase term for hundreds, if not thousands, of variables. Is an ability to \"jump very high\" one of them? That depends. What would my doctor think if I wanted a full neurological workup because I can only manage a 30-inch vertical leap? He would think I had lost my mind. However, if I were a professional basketball player who had enjoyed a 40-inch leap every day of his adult life, I would be reporting a sudden, 25 percent decline in my abilities -- not a good sign. Do such contingencies give us a Measurement Problem with respect to health? Do they indicate that medicine will never be a proper science? No. \"Health\" is a loose concept that may always bend and stretch depending on the context -- but there is no question that both it and its context exist within an underlying reality which we can understand, or fail to understand, with the tools of science. \"\n\nI think maybe the biggest flaw with the idea is that it could become a very authoritarian philosophy.

Obviously, this doesn't always happen, but current rates are estimated to be around 92 percent. The purpose is so that, if the US gets in a large war, we can institute a draft and conscript an army. This obviously makes some sense.\n\nBut I'd like to take it a step further.\n\nInstead of registering with the SSS, 18-year-olds should be required to enlist in the Army Reserve for the eight year service period.\n\nThe reasons for this are pretty simple, as I see it: Firstly, we would never need a draft again, because if a large war came, we could simply activate some of the 16 million-odd Reservists to fight. This would be far easier and less costly than organizing an entire draft.\n\nIt would also cut down on the time needed to train the newly conscripted army, as the Reservists would have been doing Reserve training all this time, and so should at least have a rudimentary knowledge of things.\n\nFrom a strictly non-military perspective, it would increase physical fitness amongst young people, which in turn should, in theory, cut down on healthcare costs.\n\nIt would also, ideally, increase discipline in the youth of the nation (at least in some).\n\nObviously, people wouldn't like it. But objections would pass, just like they do with the regular draft.\n\nAlright, that's my perspective.\n\nCMV\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

I was recently thinking, am I a Feminist? And the answer I came to was it depends on the definition. I don\u2019t think it is completely invalid, I think has some valuable insights. I think way too many people ride it off completely and other people are way too defensive about any perceived attack on it. I couldn\u2019t even come up with a coherent definition for Feminism.  Even the trite equality between men and women is not a very good. Because there are a lot of forms of equality. Separate but equal was a form of equality, and there are plenty of other forms of equality that could be in the definition. Then it occurred to me the the philosophy has gotten too large to be useful anymore and a split or shatter would benefit everyone. I am studying economics and almost everyone has a school of thought they subscribe to Marxist, Post-Keynesian, Austrian, MMT, and the people within these schools usually disagree with their school occasionally, which is fine, but by having a more specific title it allows for better communication.

I accept that they exist, and though I may not agree with their certain form of lifestyle, I don't feel that I am in any position to dictate how they should live their lives. Essentially, I am NOT a homophobe. \n\nNow the reason I believe homosexuality is a form of disease, being natures birth control is that (in my eyes, and please do correct me if I'm wrong) from a biological/evolutionary it simply does not make sense to be gay or lesbian. If we boil down the meaning of life to simple Darwinistic principles, our goal in life is to do our best to thrive on this planet and leave [as many] offspring as possible. What happens after this life is up to speculation as individuals can hold their own views on that. I'm approaching this topic purely from a non-religious point of view.\n\nNow having established that our goal in life is to thrive and leave offspring, being homosexual keeps one from achieving the latter, with the exception of surrogate mothers/sperm donors. So does that mean a homosexual individual has essentially failed to accomplish their life's goal? \n\nAlso, even though homosexuality has existed from the earliest days of humankind, today, it seems as if it is on the rise. I don't know if this is just because of the media exposure this topic is getting or if it's the new found public acceptance for such an orientation. I wish I could find a graph of sexual orientation vs time sort of like the population vs time graphs to verify/refute this theory. If homosexuality is on the rise, it is indeed understandable, as the Earth is approaching its carrying capacity of around 9-10 billion really fast, and it wouldn't hurt to have a few less babies. \n\nI come to this conclusion because I remember reading/hearing about it somewhere that there is a certain species of animal where once the species has reached the carrying capacity in that environment, a sudden influx of infertility plauges the species until their population decreases to a manageable amount. Certainly, we humans aren't exempt from nature's rules and regulations.\n\nSo that's pretty much my two cents, and once again I don't have anything against homosexuals, I simply just don't understand them.\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

While I am not personally vegan, this is because: (i) I am an unethical person who sometimes prioritizes mild increases in my own comfort/pleasure over the extreme suffering of other sentient creatures; and (ii) knowing that my individual actions are a mere drop in a large bucket, I also do not vote.

PETA's positions are consistent with that view. \n\nThe two most common criticisms directed at PETA are:\n\n* **PETA kills animals.**   PETA are utilitarians -- they basically examine the expected quality of an animal's life (much like the economic concept of expected value), and if that value is negative, they euthanize.  This means that even if there is only a 15% probability that an animal will be left unadopted (or adopted by a shitty owner) and will suffer tremendously, the negative expected value of that outcome can outweigh a larger probability of a moderately contented life.  Nobody joins PETA because they like the idea of ending animals' lives; however, anyone who has argued for assisted suicide or euthanasia in humans (which PETA's philosophical forebear, Peter Singer, also supports) should understand that a rational, dispassionate approach to death can be the most compassionate  approach overall. \n\n*  **PETA's publicity stunts are sensationalist, counterproductive and/or offensive.**  Here we're talking about campaigns that compare factory farming to the Holocaust, etc.  Through the lens of anti-speciesism, these comparisons are entirely valid.

This is for a few reasons.\n\n1) Religion incentivises action, change and hope. Often this is seen in the form of charities and support networks - however I believe the largest positive impact of this is seen at an individual level. By providing a purpose in life, or by giving some form of social awareness, religion is often providing a hope that makes people change to become better people. Obviously, this goes wrong sometimes (ie Fred Phelps), but I believe in most instances this impact is better.\n\n2) Religion brings with it a sense of community. This is an unscalably positive impact. The billions of people that have a community through religion are certainly better off from the support and friendship engrained in the structure of religion.\n\n3) Religion educates. For the majority of those who are part of a religious community, there is a large amount of moral assessment and analysis that isn't provided to that extent anywhere else. Once again, this is a benefit that extends further that just that one person - it impacts how they act around others, and more importantly, how they treat others. \n\nOften the first thing religion-dislikers jump to is the conflict that is created because religion exists. Pre-emptively, I would like to argue this: As a community, an analogy between religious conflict can be drawn to conflict between different nations. Overall I think nations are good because of the benefits they are able to provide to the individual - everything from pooled resources (infrastructure, education, healthcare, research) to pride and sense of hope. And yet even though there are wars between countries, I would still accept that overall countries are beneficial to society.\n\nThanks for reading, and thank you in advance if you comment against me.

Currently, the Bundeswehr has serious technical issues sending 6 soldiers to Northern Iraq or the promised weapons to the Kurds in Turkey because of malfunctioning planes; it furthermore has serious troubles sending helicopters needed for [Operation Atalanta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Atalanta). \nRight now, about 4000 German soldiers are deployed in several operations abroad, with an active number of c. 182000 soldiers overall.

It was envisioned and built in the early Cold War, when Germany was divided into two states and lived under the constant threat of becoming the front of World War III. West Germany needed a big army in that geo-political background. Nowadays, there is no state that would seriously consider actually militarily attacking or occupying Germany. The Russians that everyone feared in the 1950s did not attack, and even with Putin's foreign policy malarkey, they won't attack despite being - as I see it - the likeliest candidate, and even that is terribly unlikely. Germany is for all intents and purposes safe from invasion. If it would need an army at all, this army should not rely on huge numbers of soldiers but a small number of armed personell with high-quality vehicles (driving, flying, swimming, you name it) and cutting-edge weapon technology in conjunction with a reasonably-sized portion of the army that would be used for humanitarian efforts, rebuilding, state-building and training purposes abroad. I guess the number of soldiers could be a a quarter of what it is now and still function. I think this is a much more logical Bundeswehr to have in an era where we - luckily - do not have the threat of an all-out nation-state vs. nation-state war but will - sadly - face asymmetrical wars with heavy fighting of militarised groups (ISIS, Kurdish militas, civil war militas as in Syria, Boko Haram etc.).

{"input": "Ideologies (socialism, capitalism, feminism as examples) inhibit true reasoned debate, and followers of ideologies by default have a confirmation bias, CMV + \n + Firstly, I want to distinguish between an idea and an ideology: an idea is a simple concept that can be stated succinctly as a definition. For example, the free market, social/economic equality, and gender equality are all ideas. These things are simple notions that have simple, agreeable definitions.\n\nIn contrast, an ideology is a system of beliefs formed around a core idea, then builds on the idea with theory, and seeks to apply the theory to the real world to improve the world. For example, capitalism is the economic ideology that ownership of the means of production should be private, with the goal of making profits in the free market; Feminism is the ideology that women should be equal to men in all relevant regards. Respectively, these two ideologies are based on the ideas of the free market and gender equality.\n\nNow, where I believe the problem arises with ideologies is where the idea becomes an ideology, and what the ideology claims is true and what is actually true.\n\nPeople who support the central tenet of an ideology who find the ideology itself and subscribe to it, are not only accepting the central tenet, but are now taking on the theory behind it. Past arguments and observations about the tenet are accepted as fact by the person, and the person becomes familiar with many of the concepts of the ideology that are not immediately corollary to the central tenet. For example, a person who appreciates gender equality is likely to find out about the ideological movement of feminism. Within feminism are the concepts and theories about patriarchy, misogyny, sexual liberation of women, etc. In essence, ideologies take a core idea, build theory around it, which in turn creates more ideas, and this group of ideas forms an ideology, where each idea can be traced back to the original through the ideas that directly preceded them.\n\nHere is where a number of problems arise:\n\n* Theory supplants truth: The individual often accepts additional theory as a priori, and gives it little afterthought. Within the ideology, people are dissuaded from questioning theory, in fear of possibly be labelled as \"not a true _______\", which leads to the second problem:\n* The \"No True Scotsman\" fallacy now applies: when saying \"I believe in every person's right to economic equality\", it is difficult for someone to counter argue with \"No you don't\". However, when you say \"I'm a socialist because _____\", it's a lot easier for someone to say \"No you aren't, and here's why\", because of the extended theory behind socialism. If the person doesn't accept some idea encompassed in socialism somewhere, someone can make a pretty cogent argument showing them why they aren't a socialist. This of course leads to the notion of a \"true socialist\" being someone who has a certain set of beliefs that they believe encompasses socialism in its entirety. With the true Scotsman fallacy, a person can make any number of counterarguments to a person trying to defend that they're an ideologue, by showing them why they aren't that thing. This can't be done for mere ideas.\n* Ideological utopia: The ideology presents its way of thinking as the best way of thinking, where following this way of thinking will lead to a better world where everyone is happy and people are maximizing their happiness. This is a very idealized view of an ideology which fails to be convincing in any logical light, and when ideologies aren't completely in agreement within themselves (see above, no true Scotsman), the idea of what a utopia would look like can be very different. For example, a feminist who believes men and women should be equal would see the utopian future as a society where men and women are equal. A feminist who believes women are superior to men (and they do exist) would see the future as one where men are primarily or completely in control.\n* Persuasive definitions/victory by default: A person who follows an ideology tends to self-affirm their beliefs through their choice of definitions and beliefs, especially when it comes to the nature of the ideology itself. For example, the following quotation: \"You know, if you believe that your ideas should be respected and if you believe that you have a voice, then you're a feminist\". The quote immediately labels any individually-minded woman as a feminist, and says that if you believe in those things, you are a feminist. Hence, it makes the claim that \"feminism is the belief that women's ideas should be respected\". This is a *persuasive definition*, one which is made to support the individuals own views, and help them with a victory by default/definition. This is a very clear logical fallacy.\n* Confirmation bias: As people who believe in a group of ideas that stem from a central one, they are now prone to agree to new ideas that are in cooperation with the other accepted ideas, and are hence at risk of falling for a confirmation bias. An example of this would be someone who is an environmentalist (in the sense that they believe in an ideology centered on environmental consciousness/conservation) that hears that GMO foods are dangerous and bad for the environment, then subscribes to the notion that GMO foods are dangerous and bad for the environment, because of their ideological concern for the environment. In general, they put themselves at risk of not critically thinking about new accepted ideas, because their ideological theory persuades them to do otherwise.\n\nNow, this is not to say that an ideologue is not capable of critical thought about their ideology. Many great capitalists and economists, feminists, environmentalists, and communists throughout history have gone to look back at their respective ideologies, reviewed and critically analyzed them, found flaws, and applied them to their own ways of thinking and to the world, and the effects have been positive and negative in different cases. The point that I'm making though is that in the general case, ideologies are very convincing, popular, unite people, and accessible to everyone, including people who aren't as likely to critically think about them. The unfortunate result is that uneducated people or people who aren't self-analyzing their ideologies and beliefs end up representing the ideology, and often represent it poorly. These people also end up spreading their own interpretations of the ideology, often to ill-effect (eg environmental terrorism, revolutionary socialism/capitalism, radical religious movements, radical feminism, radical faeries, etc).\n\n**TL;DR:** So to summarize:\n\n* ideas are notions with agreeable definitions that are succinct and specific\n* ideologies are extensions of ideas through theory, which in turn creates new stemming ideas\n* ideologues are subject to supplanting truth for theory; the no true Scotsman fallacy; utopian future fallacy; forming persuasive definitions which lead to victory by default; confirmation bias\n* ideologies, when followed by people who don't critically analyze them, lead to misunderstandings and illogical extensions\n\nIt is for these reasons that I personally reject subscribing to any ideological systems, and leaving my set of beliefs as stand-alone objects that are subject to change with cogent argument. I want to ensure that my reasoning behind this way of thinking is itself reasonable, so I want to open it up to criticism.

You are often given a tracking number, so that you can follow your package across the world, step by step.\n\nBut in truth, that ruins the experience. The anticipation of the package is a huge part of the enjoyment of the entire enterprise. When will it arrive? Today? Or the next day? There's a great Calvin and Hobbes comic about this exact concept - the stress and emotion we give to the day's mail. But when we utilize the tracking number, the magic is lost. The unpredictability vanishes. We are reminded of the depressing fact that no, we don't actually make anything in this company any more, and even the necessary shipping facilities stateside aren't in our town - part of the reason it and its economy suck so much.\n\nBut when we ignore the tracking number, we say no to structure and the tyranny of knowing. We revive the magical qualities of our wait for the mail. Will my shirts be shipped in two packages or one? Will the arrive on different days? Where did they come from? Our lack of answers to these eternal questions catalyzes creativity and inspires imagination.\n\nJoin me, as I wait for my most recent online orders, and say no to tracking numbers.

{"input": "I do not believe that pleasing shareholders should be the priority of a company. CMV + \n + My understanding is that when someone buys shares of a company, they are purchasing a share of the equity of that company, not actually putting any money toward the growth of the company itself. When you buy a share or even 1,000 shares, your money is only going toward the previous shareholder, NOT the company.\n\nMy understanding is that the only situation your money actually is invested in the company, is when you are purchasing brand new shares, which only happens when the company is in a crisis and needs to acquire funding from investors. So, when you buy already existing shares, you are merely purchasing ownership of a part of the profit when the business eventually does grow larger and gain more equity. So, while some shareholders may have been the original investors that powered up a business that came to prosper, many of them are just wealthy people who purchased a certificate that says they get extra money if the company makes extra money...and none of their investment actually goes toward acquiring assets for the company. \n\nSo, if this is correct.. Where exactly does the perceived authority of shareholders come from? Yes, I understand they are sharing \"ownership\" of the company. But really, they are only sharing profit. Why do large corporations put more priority into pleasing the shareholders instead of the employees and customers? Especially the very large, rich, corporations whose employees work for hardly-livable wages and few if any benefits? Why are most large chain retail stores running on a skeleton crew having to spread themselves thin and compromise quality and customer service? If shareholders became unhappy and sold their shares, the company would still be making the same profit. Worst-case scenario, if everybody stated selling their shares, the price/share may drop. But that doesn't mean the company is losing money, it just has to share it's profits with less (or more) people. As long as a company's assets are greater than it's debts, the company is profitable. Prices per share only matter because of networks of companies owning eachother's shares and calling them \"assets\" so their equity is inflated by this imaginary value of how much a company's stock may sell for.. It's like a delicate castle of cards based on hypothetical values. It doesn't make sense as a long term foundation for a business. \nTLDR: Shareholders are not actively contributing money to a company.

{"input": "CMV: It should be legal in the United States to buy alcohol at any time of day. + \n + I grew up in California where it was illegal to buy alcohol from 2am-6am.  I know many other states have similar laws.  \n\nAfter living in a country where I can buy booze 24/7 it seems extremely conservative and antiquated to prohibited the hours where an adult can buy alcohol.  I am adult and can make my own choices.  It is not up to the state to police my purchase of a legal substance because they disapprove of the time of day I buy it.  Furthermore, this law is extremely odious to people who don't work traditional 9-5 hours.  What if you get of work at 2am and want a drink - too bad I guess, you should have gotten a 'correct' job that works normal hours.  \n\nHere are some objections I've heard to changing this law\n\n- **It will increase crime**\n\nI'm not sure this is true.  I live in Japan where you can buy alcohol 24/7 and the crime rate is next to nothing.  Furthermore I'd argue that when all the bars close at the same time and masses of drunk people are released into the streets at the same time it increases the amount of fights and crimes.  I've certainly seen it anecdotally.  \n\nLet's assume it is true though.  So?  It's not up to the state to police someone from buying a legal substance because of what they 'might' do.  When they commit a crime, then arrest them.  There are all sorts of potential laws that could prevent crime, for example a curfew for adults from 10pm to 5am.  But these kind of laws that severely curtail liberty for the possibility of safety are un-American.  \n\n- **It will increase drunk driving**\n\nI've never owned a car and lived within a 5 minute walk of a liquor store for my entire life.  Why should I be subject to these laws?\n\n- **People who buy alcohol at those hours never have good reasons**\n\nIt is not up to the government to police my reasons.  Morality is for the individual to decide, not the state.  \n\n- **It will force workers who work in bars and liquor stores to work way longer hours**\n\nSlavery was ended in 1865.

For every one voter that actually takes the time to do real research (which is still potentially mired by all of the false, biased information out there), there are ten, maybe more, that listen to what Fox or CNN tell them to believe and think nothing of it because it's all they know.

Anyway, those features are part of the reason why I find feminine women sexually attractive.\nNow to where the real seperation is: The difference between sexual and romantic attraction. If I'm bisexual, I find women attractive for their feminine qualities and men for their masculine qualities. There's nothing wrong with someone breaking the gender binary but more or less they're going to be male or female and that's where you're going to derive attraction from. However, when you're pansexual you're likely to derive attraction from a) Gender neutral features (Oh, they've got lovely hair or something along those lines) or emotional features (Wow, he's got an awesome personality!) exclusively. I'm not going to deny that those are attractive features to someone that's LGB, but when you see the pansexual person that's typically a determining factor.\n\n*\u2206 Alright, I'll give it to you for the physical vs. mental attraction divide. I suppose I'd be more of a physical attraction kind of person, seeing someone I find attractive physically before going up to meet them and find out if I'm attracted to them mentally as well. I still think it's a little bit of a vague arbitrary line to draw, but looking at myself and how a lot of what I find \"attractive\" in a guy are perhaps some of the more feminine features, I have to admit that bisexuality fits me more for that reason.*\n\n\n\n*\u2206 Hadn't even considered the fact that someone might be attracted physically to the person before transitioning and not after, and that bisexual physicality could cause issues while pansexual non-physicality wouldn't.*\n___\nAs a bisexual myself, I've never really understood the need for the term \"Pansexualism\". The difference in definition, as far as I can tell, is that Bisexual just means someone who could be attracted to either sex, and Pansexual is someone who could be attracted to either sex or gender identity. To me, this is more confusing for people who are trying to understand the LGBT movement because most people know what Bi means but don't know what Pan means, but also outcasts Transgender people more. For myself, if I'm fine with either sex, why would I not also be fine with either gender identity? I'm attracted to the person and what I find cute/attractive, and if I get along with them as a person arbitrary things like that don't matter.

I'd like to feel comfortable saying any word I don't mean hatefully without my intentions being doubted, but my purpose here is to have the view that there *ought* to be nothing wrong with me saying it challenged. ***Ninja Edit*** \n\nI was raised in a not particularly diverse part of America and a decent chunk of my school career was spent in classes or watching presentations or badly acted videos about how judging people based on their skin color was wrong and that labeling people based on their skin color was wrong etc. I and my white classmates and my white teachers were all pretty much on the same page about the \"n-word\" being bad and mean. \n\nNow as I'm getting older and finding myself really enjoying hip hop in general, I'm discovering that a (to me) surprising portion of the population seems to think they've taken the word back and made it their own. Which would be great if it were true because then a group of people would have been able to take a label of disempowerment, and remove the hate from it; appropriate it into something positive and wear it as a badge of honor and solidarity. And if you glanced at hip hop music out of context, you might even think they succeeded.\n\nIn that context it draws similarities to the word \"nerd\" and \"geek\" where the people labeled that way decided that what made them that way was something to be proud of, not ashamed. Obviously when you're talking about hobbies vs. race it's not a perfect example and I'm by no means trying to trivialize the oppression that did happen. I'm no stranger to the historical context of the word and why any time it comes out of a white person's mouth, it seems justifiable to be suspect of his or her intentions - but it seems to me that if the word had actually been taken back, then anyone should be able to use it in it's properly reformed context regardless of their skin color.\n\nI mean, a desk is a desk no matter who says \"desk.\"\nAnd while the people I can call \"friends\" might be different from the people you can call \"friends,\" it doesn't suddenly change its meaning -let alone become a slur of derision when someone else says it.\nSo why for a very specific group of Americans is \"my nigga\" a compliment and coming from quite literally anyone else in any other context besides academia, a racial slur?\n\nI feel like cultural appropriation is tied into this topic too, but I can't really articulate how.\n\nTLDR: If Childish Gambino, Jay Z, Lil Wayne, and Kanye West can use \"nigga\" positively, why can't Eminem if his intentions are good and the context is positive? Why does the fact that he's white mean that he can only be using the word in a hateful manner?\n\nWhen I think about it like that, it strikes me as actually pretty racist.", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

There seems to be two main reasons behind this:\n\n1.) We shouldn't teach kids to behave well in order to get things.\n\n2.) Lying to them about Santa will cause trust issues later in life.\n\nNeither of these are good reasons. Legends of Santa or a Santa-like figure have existed for centuries and they haven't brought about any sort of social issues. The idea of Santa isn't teaching children that the only reason to be good is to get something, it's simply a fun idea for Christmas. Kids don't suddenly become malevolent people once they find out that Santa didn't deliver those presents. And regardless of that, in real life, doing good things *does* often result in rewards, so it's not as though the idea is false.\n\nThe, imo, more ridiculous issue is that children will fall into some sort of existential crisis when they find out Santa isn't real. I've never met anyone who has suddenly developed trust issues after they found out. Most kids seem to just get over it after like an hour. If there is a child for whom the discovery of the truth behind Santa leads to trust issues or trauma, then that child hasn't developed a healthy sense of reasoning, and if something as insignificant as Santa would be enough to push them into mental issues, then they will inevitably be faced by far worse examples of lying later on that will take a more extreme toll. It's not the idea of Santa, it's the individual and their ability to understand basic social norms and customs. \n\nAs said before, Santa is an idea that's been around for ages. It's never caused any problems before and while people have every right to not teach their kids about him, doing so in order to protect them is frankly juvenile and unnecessary. By doing so they are denying their children a fun and harmless tradition that makes Christmas an amazing time for millions of other across the world.\n\n**TL;DR** Santa is harmless and all those claiming that the idea that he's harmful are being oversensitive.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

The French began to adopt this idea and this resulted in many political conflicts to loyalist types who could never really put down the rebellion. My professor said this was because \"Once the toothpaste is out of the tube you can't put it back in\". What he means by this is that once a right exists and is widely accepted it cannot realistically be removed from the people who want it. He goes onto explain several historical examples including why there is only one \"negative amendment\" and why it itself was amended (referring to prohibition). The major point Im trying to make is that Liberals have been historically the ones to fight for individual and civil rights.

{"input": "CMV: It is perfectly fine to shorten the yellow signal when installing traffic light violation cameras + \n + Background: Cameras get installed to catch red light violators. Since these are often contracted by for-profit companies that get a cut of each fine, the companies often get the yellow light signals shortened. The city doesn't care since it gets a cut as well. The two main arguments against this are\n\n1. It makes things more dangerous\n2. They are gouging drivers\n\nI think these arguments are irrelevant.\n\nShortening the yellow may well lead to more rear-end collisions as a driver brakes suddenly and the driver behind them doesn't brake fast enough. Well, this will reduce accidents in the long run. Cars are supposed to leave sufficient space between each other to allow sudden stops. Obviously the second car either didn't leave enough space or wasn't paying attention. When the determination of fault occurs the second driver will receive plenty of blame and hence suffer larger insurance payments. If they do this enough times, no one will provide them insurance and they'll then be forced to give up driving, which forces a dangerous driver off the roads. This is a win for safety (since the driver can no longer run over pedestrians and bicyclists).\n\nSo in essence, the accidents that are being caused are simply pointing out those drivers that are irresponsible anyways. And far better for them to rear-end another car that is stopping due to a traffic light than one that stops suddenly due to a child running out into the street, then the second car pushes the first onto the child. Or hit a pedestrian, bicyclist, or other innocent person.\n\nThe other argument is that the city is gouging drivers. Maybe so, but it's only restoring a bit of balance between driving and other modes of transportation. Drivers don't pay for all the pollution they emit, or for roads (gas tax doesn't cover everything), or for the tens of thousands they murder every year, or for the higher medical costs bought about by their driving (lack of exercise leads to obesity), or a million other things. Hence everyone else, who has better things to do than drive everywhere, are forced to subsidize drivers in their irresponsible choices. The cameras may be unfair in that some drivers will get closer to paying their fair share, but since they're all drastically underpaying, no driver is actually being gouged.", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

I have participated in protests, days of silence, and voted on all the pro-gay legislation I could. I have plastered my town in signs to vote \"Yes\" on gay marriage, and even defaced anti-gay displays (not that this in **any way** legitimizes me.

I'm not condemning the decision to defend a group of people who need defending. But I don't think trans-sexuality should be encouraged. \n\nFrom my point of view, the entire idea of the gay rights movement, and by larger extension the LGBT community, is to accept who you are. It asks you to accept yourself and to accept others as they were made, and to end judgement based on arbitrary terms like sexual preference or gender roles. That is why I want to fight for this community, to see more people happy and accepting themselves. Gay or not.\n\nBut I don't feel like trans-sexuality is self acceptance. I think it is self denial in the most extreme form. We cannot, scientifically, turn a man into a woman, or the reverse. We can remove organs. We can alter the shape and appearance of genitals. We can provide hormones which impart characteristics of a gender. But none of this truly changes a sex. Your given sex affects the development of your brain, which is something you couldn't change with all the surgeries in the world. So shelling out huge money and undergoing major biological changes just to chase the idea of the other side, it doesn't seem healthy to me. It seems like the ultimate denial.

People are all looking for a way to construct meaning in their life, and there are thousands of years of thought we can sift through in examining the human condition, whether we draw from orthodox religion ( limited, structured and restrictive -*read: potentially equally boring*), mystical, gnostic or esoteric thought (exploratory, experiential and personal) or universalism (take what you will). \n\nOn the other hand, atheism simply is.\n\nOne of the common arguments for atheism (particularly on Reddit) is that it embraces science and the natural wonder of the world.

But after you get past atheists/antitheists/agnostics as deserving of the same human rights as anybody, what is there?

This distresses me because  those courses were some of the ones that I was the best at, but feel unsure of how much use I could get out of them in the \"real world\"\n\nEven the subjects I feel that are my best (English and literature) seems to show little measure of intelligence. When I look at all the English and lit classes that I have taken (all of them honors and A.P) at school I feel like the classes boil down to ones opinion of a text so there is no right or wrong answer as long as you can justify your answer. I can not think of any other subject that works this way and feel that even though I am good in this subject it seems rather useless unless you want to be a teacher, which I would only do if I had no other employment options. \n\nWhen I look at mathematics I see a genuine skill, not memorization or justifying your opinion. There is only a single correct answer in math (I know there are a few exceptions but that is besides the point). At my school at least (I just graduated from a relatively small high school, graduating class of about 120) high level math classes are a strong indicator of intelligence. People at my school were shocked to learn that I was not in calculus (the highest level of math at my school) or even the level before it. My classmates often assumed me to be intelligent, due to the fact that I took several non math AP classes but I do not feel intelligent. \n\nMy low math scores on the SAT as well as my gpa made mine significantly lower than most of my friends. I feel that me not being good at math shows that I am less intelligent and that math is single best way to measure a persons intelligence. \n\nI am very nervous about what to major in since I feel I could try to struggle through a STEM major, or study what interests me (the notion of doing what you love over what will make money has always bother me. Every non STEM major I am interested are considered to be some of the most useless majors around. I am afraid that if I major in a liberal  arts subject that my job prospects will be horrendous\n\nI feel that math is the best way to measure a persons intelligence, even if it means that I am not intelligent. Please change my view!\n\n \n\nOn a side note, does anyone have any career related stories, as I have always been afraid that because I am bad at math, my career prospects are minimal compared to those who are good at math", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

This will be a massive problem in our society. even if unemployment only reached 30%, which is a conservative estimate, the effect on poverty and income inequity will be massive. Capitalism, which I believe to be a adequate system under our current technology, would leave the profits from this rise of automation solely with the rich one percent of people, especially with business owners, who would eventually realize that their(the one percent) lack of employing people would eventual lead them with no customer base.\n\nA capitalist economy would eventually consist of a extremely poor large homeless population, a large lower class, a extremely small middle class, and  an even smaller elite class that holds all the wealth and power, I believe you can already see some of this today.

{"input": "I don't think anyone should get extra time in an exam. CMV. + \n + This may not exist in some exams, but in the high school exams that I took (the IB), some students were allowed extra time for things such as: dyslexia, ADD, etc. Now before you think I'm a complete ass for essentially harming people with those conditions' future by not allowing them to perform to the \"best\" of their abilities (quotations will be explained later), here are my reasons for thinking as such:\n\nIn my view, an exam should assess a person's ability to absorb and process information in a manner suitable for the exam (for example: in math or physics exam, to be able to solve problems quickly and correctly). I think the exam should be used to distinguish between candidates for university, or a career. As such, I think that the time allocated is a rather large factor: if you have more time to absorb or process the information, you may eventually get it. But the point is to distinguish between person A and person B for a position. \n\nGiven an infinite amount of time, I would say more people would be able to get 100% on an exam, which then defeats the purpose of taking one unless your aim was just to have a confidence booster.\n\nNow, I also think that when applying (let's take the example of applying to university), these conditions should be considered: the admissions officer should know that your exam result may not be completely reflective of what you could do given a lot more time. But in the context of an exam, I don't think its about measuring your best abilities when given infinite time. The rate at which a student can absorb and process the information should be compared. This is why I put quotations around \"\"best\" of their abilities\". Of course they could do better with more time, but so can everyone (a generalization, I know: I recognize that I cannot say that all can answer every question correctly in an exam). \n\nNow the reason I care is that the exams are graded on a curve. If you compensate for a student's difficulty in reading by providing them extra time to raise their grade, it will (if enough are given more time) affect everyone's grade. It also doesn't tell the admissions officer what you can do in the time given normally in an exam, compared to another student. It defeats the purpose (in my opinion) of a standardized exam. \n\nAs well as this, I am a little skeptical as to the ability of the examiner to determine exactly how much more time would make the exam \"fair\".\n\n\nYes, it sucks that a person has this condition. Yes, I think it should be compensated for, or at least considered. No, I do not think that giving extra time in a standardized exam graded on a curve is the way to do so. I think it's like having a race between Pistorius and Bolt on the 100m, and giving Pistorius extra time. Then, taking that result into account as an average to determine who is the fastest runner. Again, I'm sorry for Pistorius to have a natural disadvantage (although I do not claim to be an expert in whether this provides disadvantages but I just compared best running times), but I don't think he should be given extra time due to his condition. \n\nTL;DR: I think extra time in an exam is like giving a legless man a head start in a race with Usain bolt until he almost beats him, then considering this a good comparison. \n\n\nPS: Let me know if my explanation isn't that good, or is missing some logical connectors. I'll try and clear it up to show exactly what I think.\n\n\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "I believe that the feminism movement has caused a crash in the U.S. education system, and it's a crash that we likely will never recover from. CMV. + \n + \nBefore mentioning anything, I'd like to note that I am by no means demonizing the feminism movement or anything of that nature. Instead, I'm referring to allocation of jobs; many other industries (i.e, hard sciences) received a great boon after the feminist displays in 1910 and after. However, I believe that this shift of allocation has damaged the American education system, and have only been affirmed since I've began my last year as a student teacher.\n\nIn colonial times (1772 until the end of the 18th century, essentially) teachers were primarily male; you'd honestly be hard pressed to find a female as an educator in this time, but it certainly was plausible as being an educator wasn't seen as a career. Instead, most teachers used their experience in education as a stepping stone in order to advance to other jobs, such as medical jobs, law jobs, and religious jobs. \n\nThis primarily male system continued in place until about 1820-1830. However, because of the large amount of secretarial work that comes with being an educator, most teachers did not consider education as a primary profession and instead were siphoned into fields that I mentioned prior. This only became a greater issue with westward expansion of the United States, so additional educators were required to be adopted. It was around this time that the standard of female educators (which we still hold today, but no where near to the same degree) was formed. In addition, because of females being employed into the educational field, education began to be seen as a primary occupation (albeit one that only females pursued, similar to secretarial work). \n\nHonestly, this sort of educational system lingered until late 1800s-early 1900s, with it really picking up steam in 1910s. At this time, feminism as a movement is coming into full swing; the women teacher's rebellion followed along with it. Initially, this forms into having teachers unions, better benefits, and a gamut of other improvements.\n\nBut, after the feminism movement (mid and post 1930s) had largely made ground, female educators were (similarly to males) siphoned from education as a field and into hard sciences, medical, and law fields.  **Because of this siphoning, I believe that our education system experienced a crash and has never recovered from it.**\n\nMany of the educators at this time, who were siphoned, became prize winning biologists, physicians, chemists, doctors, and a gamut of other high caliber occupations. These individuals were, quick frankly, brilliant. At no other point of history after 1930s can we really say that education is filled with brilliant individuals, primarily because they were siphoned into other occupations (yes, males were in the 1700s, but as females adopted education as a field, education didn't experience a crash). Even today, the demographic of educators is no where near the intellectual caliber as at this time (and I say that going into education myself!). This is not to say there was not brilliant teachers, as I have the pleasure to interact with them on a near daily basis and refine my pedagogical skills, but we certainly do not have the prize winning hard science individuals teaching our children like we did in the 1920s and prior. \n\nI'll mention again that I'm not demonizing the feminism movement. After this movement, there were undeniable leaps and bounds in hard sciences, and those discoveries would not have been possible without those women leaving educational positions and trading in their chalkboards for lab coats. However, education has (and still is!) experiencing a drought that it honestly cannot recover from. In order to recover from this drought, you have to make education more attractive to those who are interested in pursing doctoral and master degrees. Education is always experiencing budget cuts, has an awful public image, and is an incredibly demanding job when considering its time:money ratio. \n\nI do not believe that it is possible to make education more attractive for these individuals who otherwise would pursue hard sciences, law, and medical fields. The only real reason I hear of individuals being passionate about education is from intrinsic value, and that's certainly not something that can be advertised to everyone (Come teach! You'll find meaning or something!). Unless there's some massive rework of the education system to make it more attractive (and, honestly, who sees that coming when education isn't a field lead by educators?), I see no real way education in the United States can recover from its current drought.\n\nCMV.", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "I believe organic food production is a dangerous fad that has the potential to cause billions to die of starvation. CMV + \n + Historically, human population growth went along with increases in food production and the switch from subsistence farming to larger scale farming and eventually industrial farming. \n\nThese increases in food production were made possible by a string of innovations and increases in productivity through technological and methodological advances in farming, like crop rotation, better plowing tools, use of animal labour, use of manure as fertilizer, breeding of crops and livestock, chemically produced fertilizers and pesticides, and, as of late, genetic modification of crops.\n\nToday is the first time in recorded history that we deliberately use farming methods that decrease output under the moniker of organic food production. \n\nI believe that the desire for organic food production is a symptom of rich and saturated societies, and is what we here know as a \"first world problem\". This desire has the potential to compromise the global food output if it becomes more wide-spread and increase the number of people living in hunger and dying from starvation.\n\nI don't contest that chemically produced fertilizers and pesticides and GMO crops must be used carefully and in measured amounts to get the risk/benefit balance right, and yes, there are risks, hazards and dangers associated with them.

I was quite surprised how many highly voted comments praised Reagans doing. The thread turned into a reverse circlejerk where everyone complains about people that think Reagan was wrong in doing so.\n\nI think everyone no matter who one works for or is employed by has the right to fight for better working conditions. Thereby Reagan had no right to fire those air traffic controllers even if it was backed by the law.\nI know that a strike by a government union is illegal by the U.S.C. but I think that this is not just.\nI do not want to just discuss this political move but furthermore the right to strike that should be given to everyone no matter what.\n\n\nTo further explain my point of view I would like to quote three comments (please note that I do NOT want to expose them for their beliefs):\n\n[The economy would have easily crashed if he did not do this. It was a great move.](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2b3z7p/til_in_1981_ronald_reagan_fired_11345_air_traffic/cj1oj2c) \n\nFirst of all how you can call firing 11345 workers and banning them for life a \"great move\" is completly beyond me. This complety ignores the human tragedy that might be involved for the individuals. Secondly to claim that this would \"easily crash\" the economy is based on nothing but factless assumptions. To be honest I do not know which impact such a strike would have had on the economy but this is also not my point. The real problem with this statement is that it puts a profitable market over the working individual. With the claim that something would crash the economy or on a smaller level the corporation is market radical thinking which justifys any form of exploitation.\n\n\n[If you declare that you're going to quit going to work, and then you quit going to work, your boss might fire you. You should really know that going in.](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2b3z7p/til_in_1981_ronald_reagan_fired_11345_air_traffic/cj1oe9e) \n\nThis would basically eliminate every right to strike. As a strike is the only \"weapon\" workers have against their employers it eliminates any fight for better working conditions or fair pay.\n\n[Public employees holding the public hostage for higher wages should never be tolerated.](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2b3z7p/til_in_1981_ronald_reagan_fired_11345_air_traffic/cj1o0gq)\n\nI think this claim is very problematic because the point of a strike is to force the employer not to ignore the demands that are made and as explained above it is the only \"weapon\" available. In a way the point of every strike is to hold the employer hostage because the production stopps. As the employer here is the public the public is held hostage. So this statement prohibits civil cervants to strike which I think is wrong.\n\nA big problem here is that the strike for civil servants is illegal which I think is wrong.

{"input": "I believe that people shouldn't be legally held accountable for their actions when significantly intoxicated, CMV. + \n + Sounds like a political post, but it's actually more philosophical.\n\nOne thing we can surely all agree on is that people often do things when they are drunk that they wouldn't do sober. They may drop their morals and eat meat if they're vegetarian, for example, or cheat on their partner when in a relationship. As much as it is shameful for doing this, there's a good chance they would never have done it while sober.\n\nThis is the point in the discussion where people normally say \"But they *chose* to get drunk, therefore they need to deal with the consequences!\" and this may be true for a lot of cases - they will often have to deal with their partner breaking up with them for cheating, but they can move on from this easier than say; being put to jail for drunk driving.\n\nSo, in what way do people change when they get drunk? I know of quite a few people who suddenly become easily led, despite being strong and independent while sober. I know of people who become forgetful, they literally *forget* that they're a vegetarian, or that it's wrong to flirt with someone when in a relationship. Also, what if someone has 100% forgotten the incident due to drunkenness -- is it fair to say that it's as if *it wasn't actually them*?\n\nSo, if someone is peer pressured into driving while very drunk, I don't think they should be so heavily prosecuted, as people can become more susceptible to peer pressure or can even forget what they're doing is wrong.\n\nChange my view. \n\n\nYou have one drink. This effects you ever so slightly, but not enough to change how you act significantly. So you have a second through *almost* sober choice. Then maybe a third or even a fourth, still reasonably unaffected. Then you become a bit more \"slurred\" and blas\u00e9 about your actions, so I believe any further drinking is no longer a consequence of the sober and sensible mindset you had at the start. Your opinion of when you've had enough is different when you're sober to when you're drunk. Your first drink was taken by your sober mindset, the second by the mindset created by the first, the third by the second, and so on.

Celes vs Cloud (parallels abound, but Celes is the more epic character in my eyes. So Cloud loses his love? Celes loses the world). Kefka is the principle example of nihilistic villainy. Sephiroth is brutal with the personal injuries to Cloud and co, but nowhere near on Kefka's level. Plus, that laugh. The killing of Aerith does not compare to the killing of Cyan's wife, child, and friggin country. \n\nGraphics Here's my argument's weakest point in my eyes. Granted, FF7 was the first in the series to pull off 3d, but at the same time the world of 6 has much more to offer. 2 worlds, in fact, in pixel art at the peak of the form. This one is more aesthetic, but I will say until that hd remake happens final fantasy 6 has aged better visually: It wasn't about gimmicks like polygon count, it was about building a world. You can see squares shift from immersion to spectacle begin here, a step that in my opinion forsake video game's greatest strength (the player) in favor of the film industry's fare (the viewer).\n\nGameplay This one is close, seeing as 7 took much from 6, but I will say 6 simply has more. More characters, more fighting styles, more strategic depth, more variety and more world to explore. No motorcycle mini game in 6 though.

{"input": "CMV: I believe that charities are bad + \n + Dislaimer: I am not talking about overseas charities (I haven't thought about them as much), I am talking about national or regional ones.\n\nI hold far left-wing views on politics and society and I honestly think that charity actions are not helping anything in the long run. Often, they do quite opposite.\n\n* Charities are mostly apolitical - they raise money for a cause but at the same they distract people from the reason why the problem happened and do not propose anything to solve it\n\n* Charities unintentionally compete with eachother - people only have that much money and cannot donate everywhere. As such, the most succesful charities are the most vocal ones, which means they have to spend money for promotion of themselves, which could be spent on helping the cause (or actually raising awareness of it or trying to find the way to fix it)\n\n* Not only people can't help all charities, they often feel that they've helped enough by donating and get less interested in the topic\n\n* Speaking of advertisement, charities often resort to a tabloid-like advertisement, by manipulating emotions - showing cute pictures of happy family before a child got sick, using diminutive names or disempowering adjectives (e.g. \"Our **little Nathan** has leukemia\"), often accompanied with sad music - all to manipulate people\n\n* Charity actions are often used as a sort of \"get-out-of-being-criticized card\", this is popular with the companies, but I much often see this in the Internet, where some controversial internet persona organizes charity actions, which are then used as a way to dismiss any criticism towards such persona - aka they aren't made out of self-interest\n\nThis and some more problems are easily visible in the case of charities helping one person, let's make an example:\n\nLawrence Smith lives in Republic of Hypotheria, a democratic country with universal healthcare, with his daughter Lucy. However, Lucy has a serious illness (let's name it AFD, for \"acute fictional disease\") which requires medical treatment unavailable in Hypotheria, it can only be treated abroad - something that Lawrence can't afford. Now, the scenario splits into two directions:\n\n* **Scenario one**: Lawrence is a poor factory worker - by that he is on the mercy of the giant charity organisations in Hypotheria, which can either accept or decline his cry for help. And this is where business comes in - such charity has to pay for the adverts in TV and other media, they need to account the money etc. What if advertising this cause is hard? (for example, people are completely unaware of AFD, because it's a very rare, genetic ilness). What if the father was an alcoholic? What if he was arrested in the past for a theft? This can create bad publicity for the charity (\"BIG CHARITY HELPING CRIMINALS\" in a national tabloid - quite a good scandal), they can reject him for their own safety, even though it is his child who needs help, not him.\n\n* **Scenario two**: Lawrence, although not being able to fund his daughter's treatment, is a rich, local businessmen - he creates his own charity action for the sake of helping his own daughter, getting posters all over the town, organising charity concerts, mobilizing students for charity work - nice of him to do that for his own daughter, but what about other ill children? Such charity effectively sucks the money and society's eagerness to help only for his cause. Not only that, he's not really a poor person, some could argue there are people who are in bigger need for help. His charity only showcases inequality, where poor can't even afford help from others.\n\nThe most important thing however, regardless of the scenario, is that charity won't actually help the cause (curing the AFD), but the person (suffering from AFD). The biggest issue raised will probably a one-liner like \"Unfortunately, in order to be a smiling child free of AFD again, Lucy needs expensive treatment in &lt;other country&gt;, you can help make her dream come true by\u2026\". The questions such as what is AFD, how to cure it, why is it not covered by national insurance, how can it be prevented and many others, will never be raised. Problem won't be solved, This basically sticking a patch on sinking boat instead of replacing the boat. A very expensive patch.\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

You are ridiculous, to file a lawsuit against your own parents...\"*\n\n*\"What an ungrateful, spoiled little brat. Guess what, you are now 18 which legally makes you an adult so go out and get a job and support yourself. Even better, start acting like an adult rather than a 3 year old...\"*\n\n*****\n\n**Why does she have a case?**\n\nAlthough these resposnes are are basicallly correct in the idea that she is an adult and now responsible for herself and her choices, they fail to address what the actual article is about.  Look at what she's actually asking for:\n\n*\"Her suit also demands the following of the Cannings:* **that they take care of an outstanding $5,306 Morris Catholic tuition bill**; *pay their daughter\u2019s current living and transportation expenses; and* **free up her existing college fund**, *as she\u2019s already been accepted to several universities.\"* [emphasis added]\n\nI would not necessarily endorse her claim to \"living and transportation expenses\", but perhaps that (in addition to paying the legal fees) is just and proper punishment for parents who spitefully refuse to pay for a school **THEY** enrolled her in, and who are holding her college fund hostage to their demands. (I believe that college fund does become *hers* once she reaches 18, as such funds are generally set up in the child's name and are to be used specifically for school tuition costs.)\n\n*****\n\n**Bottom line, this isn't just a \"spoiled brat\" who doesnt appreciate her parents; there really are two sides to this story, and I think she has a pretty strong case.**\n\n\n*****\n\n\nMy original view was primarily from a moral standpoint, although that is not how I phrased it. It seemed wrong that her parents would take these actions simply because they had the power to do so. I was looking at this from that power-play standpoint. Yes, parents have the ability and authority to dictate the terms for ongoing support, and as a legal adult she has the right to refuse those terms. The power to refuse means she has the responsibility to then pay her own way under her own terms. The parents can refuse access to a college fund, but should they? \n\nI found myself asking whether such behavior was really appropriate on the parents' part. How much ongoing control should a child be subject to in order to gain access to such funds as were already set aside for her education? Should they really have the power to dictate who she is allowed to date or where she must live? How far should they be allowed to go in dictating her behavior and life choices simply because they hold her college fund hostage to their demands?  Isn't this extortion? Do they also get to dictate how she must dress, where she may go, who she may be friends with, if she is allowed to drink coffee, if she must get up or go to bed at specific times? Are there no appropriate limits on what they should be allowed to demand from a moral standpoint? \n\nIf they really cared about what was best for her future, wouldn't they want her to get an education, even if she made a few other mistakes along the way? My conclusion was that the parent's behavior was not intended to be \"for her own good\". Their behavior was that of petty tyrants punishing an otherwise good person because they couldn't exert their preferred level of control over her life. This is not the act of good parents, this is the act of emotional children who are throwing a tantrum because they can't get their way, because their daughter won't abide by their unreasonable demands.\n\nParents with the ability to help their child get an education should absolutely do so, without making this assistance conditional on other irrelevant factors. To do otherwise is to fail in their duty to be good parents and to give in to purely selfish desires to maintain control at any cost. So long as the money is well spent and their daughter succeeds in school, then there should be no other conditions on her behavior. The college fund already exists and they are using it as a tool of manipulation and extortion for their own ends, not for their daughter's sake. This is disgusting and immoral in my opinion.\n\n*****\n\n\nThese are not the actions of loving parents trying to do the right thing. These are the actions of immature petty tyrants throwing a tantrum because they can't get their way and exert improper control over their daughter. *Can* they do it? Yes. They have the power to do the wrong thing. Is the Law on their side? Yes. It is not illegal to be an asshole. But they are clearly in the wrong. In this instance, where a child's college fund is being held hostage to unreasonable demands, I would like the judge to order them to hand it over. If this sets a precedent, then so be it. Parents who establish a college fund then attempt to manipulate and extort their children to achieve irrelevant and arbitrary behavioral outcomes should lose control of those funds immediately.", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "I am incredibly prejudiced against homeless people, CMV. + \n + As the post dated, I am incredibly prejudiced against homeless people. If you're homeless I think there can be only two possible reasons. \n\nReason number one: you are lazy. Reason number two: you have fucked over everyone in your life so much that no one is willing to help you get off the street.\n\nI understand that a portion of homeless people have mental illness. However, I think reason 2 still applies. You must have screwed your relationships so much that no friends and no family did anything to save you from a life debilitating disease. \n\n---\n\nFor those that are interested, here's why I think I feel this way. When I was younger (before my parents became upper-middle-class) we lived in Bridgeport, Connecticut. We lived in basically the nice part of the ghetto. Even though we weren't rich, my parents always helped others. My dad knew a college friend who he met in engineering school when they were both still living in India (they were both immigrants). \n\nThe guy apparently invested every single penny in the markets and lost it all. He was filthy rich before. My dad found out that he was homeless, and invited his entire family (his 16-year-old daughter, his wife, and obviously his friend) to live with us. All of my family had to make adjustments. My sister and I had to move into one bedroom and the homeless family moved in to my sisters bedroom, which was actually the largest room in the house. \n\nAfter a week or so and they settled down. My parents suggested that they should start sending resumes out. However this guy would only send resumes out to management positions. Even still after months and months went by, my dad finally convinced him to get a job. Any job. So he got a retail job. If memory serves me correctly I believe it was at RadioShack. \n\nMy dad lent him a small hatchback Mazda GMC for him to use to get to work and back. This was obviously a nuisance for my parents because they both worked and therefore one parent would have to drop off the other. Not to mention that my parents were sharing one vehicle to get to 2 different jobs, as well as to take 2 different kids to their extracurricular activities. This might sound like a first world problem, but bear with me - I have a point.\n\nWhat does this guy do after he received his first paycheck? He takes his entire family out to McDonald's. His wife (which by the way was not looking for work) later asked her husband to dryclean her clothes. \n\nMy mother stood up when she heard this request and told his wife that not only ridiculous given the fact that they were homeless and were living in someone else's home, but that she should really start looking for job as well. Her reply was \"I don't have an education [meaning she didn't have a college degree]. I can't work in some menial job. If I do that where is my dignity?\"\n\nDignity this woman says. Now both my parents worked, but my dad made the lion's share. My mom worked as a factory worker making $35,000 maximum year. You can imagine how I felt when I saw my mom crying  because of those words by his wife. That insensitive bitch indirectly told my mother that she didn't have any dignity because my mother was also not college-educated and was working at menial job to help our family get out of Bridgeport.\n\nIn addition their 16-year-old daughter skipped school frequently, and did not want to get a job either because she learned from her mother. Eventually he got fired from his retail job. And after waiting weeks and weeks and weeks for him to get another job my parents finally said that it was time for them to leave. They ended up staying for about a half a year in our home. \n\nHere's the kicker. My dad told me that before I was born he tried to help another homeless person out when he was single in Ohio, and it ended up almost as tragically. \n\nSo I know I have a bias, however I think I'm right.

For example, a chemistry student will learn how to successfully write a paper in their required English course, which they might not learn in their degree track (but hopefully should have learned in high school.)

They are created with the dry, and wet ingredients mixed seperatly, and then combined before baking.  The muffin started as a rural food, as most of the ingredients were grown by, and available to farmers / the lower class.\n\nCupcakes date back to around the early 19th century, and were simply just an easier, more convenient way for the upper class to enjoy cake.  Cupcakes are created using the \"creaming\" method in baking, and are literally just small sweet, sugary cakes.  \n\nThe greatest distinction between the two is the fact that one is cake, and the other is a bread which typically uses wheat, with yeast to rise.\n\nMy issue with this whole thing is that it's more or less just a personal annoyance that the word Muffin has come to mean \"Cupcake that we don't want you to think of as a cupcake\" in North America.

Multiculturalism is the way of the world, and I'm all for it. Plus, immigrants bring fresh ideas (and delicious food). Not to mention that English is an insanely difficult language even for native speakers, so I'm not going to begrudge people for speaking it with an accent.\n\nWhat I do have a problem with is people who speak English fluently and with an American accent suddenly lapsing into another accent to say a specific word. This mainly arises with Latinos using identity markers ('latino', 'chicano') or foods ('quesadilla'). However, most of these words have been adopted into English as true loanwords; English speakers understand them and use them often. But I often hear people on the news, e.g. a policy analyst of Latin-American extraction, using words like \"latino\" with a Spanish lilt that sounds (to me) out-of-place and exaggerated.\n\nSuddenly switching to another accent, at best, is confusing, as it takes the listener's brain that extra millisecond to adapt to a new style of speaking. At worst, it sounds kind of pretentious and exclusionary.\n\nI'm not arguing that we should completely anglify these words -- I don't want to hear someone pronounce 'quesadilla' with a hard L sound, like the grandma in Napoleon Dynamite. Rather I think we should treat Spanish loanwords like we do words like \"kindergarden\" (German), \"sake\" (Japanese), or \"joie de vivre\" (French) -- try as best we can to respect the original pronunciation, but maintain our typical accent when saying them.\n\nDoing otherwise is just kind of disrespectful. To illustrate: I am a reasonably proficient Spanish speaker and have spent a lot of time in Spanish-speaking countries. Once I was speaking with a local (edit: in Spanish) and used the word \"iPod\", which left him scratching his head. I couldn't figure out why -- I knew, in fact, that he owned one too. Then it hit me -- I was pronouncing the 'i' sound like the English \"eye\", which is a confusing sound for Spanish speakers, especially when surrounded by Spanish words. Once I pronounced it as \"ee-Pod\", he immediately knew what I was talking about. From then on, when speaking Spanish, I always try to 'spanishify' the pronunciation of vowel sounds to avoid these kind of misunderstandings.\n\nSo CMV.\n\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

Granted, older consoles used chips often found in PC's (the NES's CPU was based off the design of the one used in the Apple II and C64, Genesis used the Zilog Z80 And Motorola 68K, ect.) but they produced results that greatly differed from one another in terms of processing, sound and graphics. But with this current gen, both the Xbox One and PS4 use the same micro-architecture (x86) in their APU's that are manufactured by the same company, AMD, that is used in current PC's today. Many of both consoles' non-exclusives have also been shown to underperform graphically when pitted against desktops made for the same price as them.\n\n\nThe other point that I feel no longer separates consoles and PC's is their firmware and the need to constantly update it as well as patch games via internet. Again, with older consoles, if I put a functioning copy of Super Metroid in any working SNES, it should play immediately, and that's it. I can understand with the 6th Generation's addition with a UI to adjust the clock, manage saves and other basic functions, but when there were additions like internet browsers, multimedia players, Streaming Video, and other services that added nothing to one's gameplay experiences, it seemed like a waste of resources, and redundant when my computer can do the same things.\n\nAnd on the subject of online patches, I'd like to give another example concerning cartridge-based games. Sure, there were rereleases of patched games, like Final Fantasy 6 fixing a bug with a character's common skill or one of the Shinobi games taking out the blatant copyright infringing characters or Ocarina of Time's removal of bugs and Islamic references. But most times, the game you bought was the game you got. Now, we have to add storage devices to hold all the revisions of Skyrim, Borderlands, and Halo; a similar issue PC users have to deal with.\n\n\nAnother small point is that of maintenance. Ignoring that older consoles last longer due to simpler internals and arguably more durable designs, 360's are imfamous for their Red Ring of Death errors. And if it wasn't covered under warranty, and you don't have the specific parts to fix it, you may be SOL. And yes, it is possible to for PC's to be totaled for numerous reasons. However, you can more easily test components to see which could be salvaged, and which need replaced, and you have plenty of different makes and models to choose from.\n\n\nI realize that in this argument, I may failed to avoid the \"PC Master Race\" circlejerk enticement.

{"input": "CMV: Timed essays like the SAT don't properly measure one's writing skills, nor their critical thinking skills. + \n + Timed essays, especially with as little time as the SAT gives, force test takers to come up with a BS answer without really thinking about it. As a result, they are either forced to justify an answer that they really aren't confident about, or they don't have enough time to write about their well-founded conclusion.\n\nConsider the following essay question:\n\nDo memories hinder or help people in their effort to learn from the past and succeed in the present?\n\nThis is a really interesting question. I wouldn't expect anyone but those that have already thought about it to formulate a truly essay-worthy opinion (one that they are confident in, and can truly justify it because they have thought through all facets that are apparent to them), and write about it in twenty-five minutes. If I don't have the time to truly form an opinion, how can you claim to measure this ability? It measures my ability to make a decent-*sounding* opinion in a short amount of time, and write about it.\n\nI understand that test-takers are given a quote to consider before writing their essay, in addition to the question itself. This may indeed help people formulate their opinion, but it will also make it easier for test-takers to take a cookie-cutter opinion from the quote, which is really what many are forced to do given the time requirements, and write an essay without really formulating their own opinion.\n\nFurthermore, everyone knows that one of the most fundamental aspects of good writing is good editing. Everyone's first draft in almost any form of writing is going to be poor. Ask the folks over at /r/writing if you're not sure. I know that the graders know that, and that they grade accordingly, but you can't really measure one's writing skill from a first draft. This is because the purpose of the first draft is really to put ideas on paper, and you get rid of the crappy ideas and crappy phrasing by editing. It really puts a damper on one's essay to have 25 minutes to write, even if one devises their argument in the instant they receive the question, and be forced to not only be rushed at the very writing of it, but to not have time to edit.\n\n\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

I'm an atheist, I believe in evolution and all that jazz. However, I don't believe in science's ability to provide capital-T definite Truths, only small-t truths (or what I consider to be tentative truths), which are marred by social influences, human blindness and methodological flaws. I believe there is, to some degree, a scientism to be wary of when considering questions of what we know, and do not accept anything just because it is stated to be \"science\", but based on a pragmatic assessment of the work's epistemological value (which I recognize, of course, to be built upon my own premises, as I am not a perfect arbiter of truth either, and ultimately requires a lot of research in order to fully understand what is being presented to me) in order to determine on a personal basis how believable the evidence is, though, of course, it is never perfect.\n\nThe reason I do this is because I think that taking science as authority in itself is a flawed premise to come from, and that the questioning of science is more in line with scientific principle than not. Firstly due to the fact that science relies on a succession of paradigms (in the Kuhnian sense), but also because too often I see people purport scientific claims that are ill-founded and based on unreasonable grounds. Further, I see a danger in entrusting science without due consideration, scientists being within a social frame, to make accurate determinations without bias necessarily, be it political in nature (such as the old scientific racism or modern day neurosexism) or just by chasing the random whims of their mind's eye (I see string theory like this often, if only because it doesn't even meet Popperian requirements of falsification, at least not yet). However, often I run into people who bawk at the questioning of a reified Science in any capacity, and am confused for the sort of person who may be a climate change denialist or an intelligent design advocate.\n\nAn aside: do not confuse this for blind acceptance of non-scientific things.

They can also be more moderate measures such as a maximum liquid wealth (limit to how much can be kept without spending) or simply a steeply scaled taxation.\n\nThe main arguments I see against this idea is that it supposedly might reduce incentive for highly skilled people to do highly demanding jobs and that it might reduce incentive for innovation. I would say that a limit on the amount of money a person can make as a multiple of the minimum wage is perfectly acceptable, especially when there are people making minimum wage that work much harder (just to get by) than other wealthy people.

Of course, being a 17 year old male and *against* porn makes me a minority, but nevertheless, I have not been persuaded to change my opinion.\n\nI believe that pornography is too readily available to young children, who are viewing it at increasingly lower ages, partially due to the increased number of computer tablets children have access to now. This actually makes them able to access porn by accident and without prior knowledge of what it is. Blocking porn by default would solve this 'accident' issue.\n\nMore importantly, the 'opt in' system would open up pornography to discussion. When I got my first computer, my parents talked to me about porn and how women aren't really how they appear in the films and men aren't all that well endowed. I still watched some, but wasn't so amazed by it, since I knew it wasn't an accurate replication of sex. I feel that communication is key to addressing the fixation some people have on porn and to the issues associated with that fixation. Furthermore, the fact that most teenagers don't want their parents to know about their viewing of porn suggests that they feel it is a bad thing to be doing.\n\nWhile I think that communication is the main solution to the problems with violence and unhealthy obsessions associated with pornography, a 'default block' is certainly the best thing to do about it right now.\n\nSo, uh, change my view please.\n\n**TLDR: A porn block would promote conversation about porn and its dangers and stop accidental viewing by young children.**\n\n[Here's a bit of info about what's happening in the UK.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23401076)", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

A university should not be allowed to divert funds from any other part of the university to athletics.\n2.

The only requirement of the program and link to the university would be that the athletes participating must be students.  If the program wants to pay players, great.  It would be similar to minor league sports.\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n* Many Universities cannot afford their athletic department and increase tuition and fees for the general student body to offset the shortfall.  The latest example I can think of is the University of North Texas hiking up tuition to build a new football stadium.  According to the NCAA ~~43%~~ 91% of ~~academic~~ athletic departments lose money on their programs.  Resources are being shifted away from academics and toward athletics.  Tuition is already so high at many universities that buying a house would be a cheaper option.  Athletics is driving up this cost unnecessarily and providing zero academic benefit to students.\n* Many athletes are not students in any sense of the word.  They aren't accepted into the university with the same standards as the general student body and don't concern themselves with academics.  Taking 6 hours of ballroom dancing does not make a football player a student\n* Athletics has absolutely nothing to do with higher education and no academic purpose.  This is the biggest issue for me.\n* Athletics diverts vital resources such as tutoring and office hours away from the general student body and toward athletes.  These resources should either be available to every student equally or available to none.\n* Athletics breeds inequality.  Star athletes are not held to the same academic standards as the rest of the student body.  If we are continuing the charade that athletes are students they should be held to the same standard as students.\n\nI suppose this argument could be tweaked a bit to apply to middle schools and high schools as well.

Should we as a society make more of an effort to be aware of transgenderism? Perhaps, but it'd be so difficult to enforce. Do we start making it the norm to call people by their identified gender? How would anyone be able to gauge that, without the person wearing a nametag or something? \n\nPlus I hold the belief that ill-intention or not, people are just psychologically going to respond to differently to people they don't come into contact with on a regular basis. Because I'm from a society that has up until now not had many African migrants, every time I see an African person on the street I instinctively do a double-take. This is not because I'm an ignorant racist who wants them all to return back to Africa, it's just that I haven't been conditioned with them around me, so seeing an African person triggers an immediate, subconscious curiosity in me. Likewise with transgendered people, if someone told me they were trans and asked me to call them a certain label I'd happily oblige, but I wouldn't expect that to be the end of their social identity as the other gender, especially if they biologically still resemble their birth sex. \n\nIn essence, there is a small minority of people who are born with physical differences that are just too noticeable that we should expect most people to just ignore them. Whether that's if you're born into the wrong sex, dwarfism, being super-tall, being born with a missing limb, etc. It's completely unreasonable to expect society to automatically accommodate them 100% of the time. Yes, it is a shitty situation for whoever it affects, but that's why it's *part of the package.* If you're a dwarf, you sure as hell are going to expect people immediately judging you on your physical stature. Does that make them right to do so? No, it doesn't. Does that mean you should feel resentment every time someone makes an elf joke?

Additionally, the most inexperienced drivers (young drivers) are also the population more likely to engage in texting while driving.

{"input": "CMV: Students who receive no financial aid from their parents should be able to declare independent on their FAFSA. + \n + \n\nI really wanna talk more about this. Surely I'm missing something. I have three major issues:\n\n1. You're screwing the kid over, plain and simple. Mommy and Daddy make $100,000/year and don't wanna pay for college, you are quite simply screwed.\n\n2. The only reasonable way to become independent is to get married or pregnant. Are we really going to encourage 18-24 year olds to get married and have kids? That's the most unstable part of your young adult life.\n\n3. People aren't stupid, they see this flaw. You are creating a drift between the socioeconomic classes because poor people get $5,500+ a year and middle class people don't. \"You just got that money because you're poor.\" \"I wish my parents were poor!\" I hear this shit all the time.\n\nThese are some basic arguments because I feel like I'm missing a big piece of this scenario and hopefully all the clouds will part after I am enlightened.\n\n\n4. This places potentially life crippling debt on a person who falls into the category I'm describing. You could ruin someones life over how much their parent makes.\n\n5. To go with that, a student has no control over their parents, and thus really no control over their FAFSA. Yet we award them based on it.\n\n6. To top that piece off, you cause psychological distress by awarding some people and not others over what is basically random chance. A student simply cannot control such aspects of their life.\n\nIf we will award a low income student due to their uncontrolled aspects of life, why will we then turn around and deny a middle class student awards due to their uncontrolled aspects of life?\n\n\n1. This allows your parents to control your life a lot. They might hold money over your head and force a career on you.\n\n\nTo some degree, yes, any such system can be gamed. However, there's a pretty clear limit, and the costs of doing so aren't insignificant. FAFSA funding is incredibly important for those who need it, but in comparison to what a \"rich\" family can provide it's a relatively small amount. Sure, a rich family could withdraw support in order to \"score\" FAFSA funding for their kid (on someone else's dime), but in doing so they'd be guaranteeing that FAFSA funding was the only assistance their kid was getting. My guess is that most rich families who are already willing to throw money at their kids won't be willing to cut them off entirely over the amount of money FAFSA offers, especially with the amount of effort involved.\nIs all of this more work for FAFSA? Sure, but as you've mentioned it would probably only be necessary for a relatively limited number of cases.\nBasically, I'm not seeing a reason why FAFSA wouldn't be able to add some sort of exemption process for students receiving no familial support without compromising support for lower-class students. Sure, it might not be easy, but in a country the size of the U.S. the number of people who would benefit is far from insignificant.\n\nAnd that ladies and gentlemen is pretty much exactly what I'm after.\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

They were striving to better their abilities through use of the metal under the tree the Na'vi inhabited. \n\nArguably, Colonel Quaritch **COULD** have massacred the residents of Hometree. It was well within his ability and means. Instead, a chance to evacuate is given, and Quaritches forces **target Hometree itself, not the Na'vi** The fleet do not gun down the fleeing residents, nor do they pursue. Their goal was the resources under the tree, and not the extermination of the people.\n\n\nNext, Quaritch ceases hostilities against the Na'vi until Jake assembles a massive force around the headquarters. Quaritch **COULD** have met them in battle, but instead what does he do? Tries to avoid direct bloodshed by taking out a cultural symbol, thus potentially avoiding loss of life among both Na'vi and Human. \n\n\nThe culture of the Na'vi could have ended up like the Native Americans. Conquered, but preserved through merciful reservations granted by the victors. Instead they opted for resistance, and I'm interested to see what the sequel holds for them.

For example, I saw a post on two x that didn't really refute any restrictive abortion policies but just stated the right to bodily autonomy as an argument against them. I don't feel like stating that is a proper refutation. I think that if we were to look at something like sex selective abortion policies it might be more obvious what I see is wrong with those arguments. Imagine if they were having a debate in India. One person brings up all this data about the problems with unrestricted sex selective abortion and the other person simply said that those policies shouldn't be allowed because it was their right to an abortion for whatever reason they wish. This would be bad because the discussion is far too nuanced.\n\nI think that there are problems that arise from hiding behind this argument. The fundamental reason I would consider it bad is this. Rights are a human construct. A bunch of people got together and decided that guaranteeing certain rights would be best for the people. It seems perfectly reasonable that they could've been wrong and that guaranteeing those rights in certain situation are bad. Not trying to suggest whether or not they are.

The Millet system is an alternate model for federalism in which rather than have state laws apply over strict geographical regions, the government is composed of Millets whose law applies to its people rather than places.\n\nThe first example of a Millet system is the Ottoman's system, in which Millets were defined by religion. However Millets could also be constructed around ethnicity, language, nationality, or whatever trait that could hold a person to identify with their Millet.

In fact I find it a lot less likely that a civil war could've occurred at all.\n\nThis would've made a lot of the issues the US had with the state system void, but preserved the benefits of a federal system.\n\nThere are obviously problems with the Millet system of course.

However a song cannot have a specific story if it does not contain vocals that also tell this supposed story. \n\nYou might be able to make a case for it if the story is told through real life sounds imposed over (say gun shots followed by screams and police sirens... or something like that) but I have not found an example of such a thing in my time listening to music. \n\nPerhaps there is something I am missing to this, or maybe I am just really shallow.

I think the only reason adoptive parents want to distance the kids from the birth parents is for selfish reasons. They said, \"she carried him for 9 months, but you're actually raising him.\" So why should she see him... She doesn't want Joshua to say \"you're not my mom\" or even feel it, but that's Kim Whitley's problem and hers alone. It's not Joshua's. She said \"if Joshua at age 18 wants to find his birth parents, that's on him.\"  Why 18? Why not 14 or 10 or 2?\n\nSome people give up their babies into open adoptions where they get pictures and updates, but then adoptive parents close the adoptions, meaning they move and cut off all contact with birth parents. If kids want to find their birth parents they have to go looking. \nI think it's selfish. It's because they want to raise their baby without another set of parents butting in. The other set of parents isn't going to damage your child in any way. They just feel threatened that the child may want some type of connection or relationship with birth parents at some point, and that may usurp their position as parent. \n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

Biblical scholars use other documents that were in circulation during the time in question in order to get clues about the Bible.\n\nSo when Genesis talks about a firmament (Hebrew: *raqia*) in the sky that held back water, it should be understood that they meant an actual solid dome. This is the most natural understanding of the word because it is a view held by other groups of people living at that time. We obviously know now that there is no dome above the earth.\n\nYEC's try to argue that the firmament is just referring to the sky, and they attempt to make the science fit the text. But this is only because they have a false assumption that the Bible will be in harmony with modern science (Concordism). \n\nYEC's claim to simply be reading the Bible literally but they are reading it in an entirely different context than that which it was written in. Filtering it through a 21st century cosmological context that did not exist at the time just misses the point entirely. But nowadays we shift the interpretive reference point to whatever we feel is important at the time (ie. modern science).\n\nI understand why Atheists and other non-believers would argue against this but it is only battling a false assumption.

He had been a bomber in World War 2; I forget whether he was a pilot or what, but that's irrelevant to my argument.

I understand that it's brand new and the price will eventually come down, but for now, that's way too much.\n\nSPECS\n\n* 5 Megapixel camera for Glass, compared to 8 Megapixel for the Iphone.\n* 720p video camera on Glass, compared to 1080p for the Iphone.\n* 12 GB data storage capacity for Glass, compared to 16, 32, or 64 GB for the Iphone. This doesn't take cloud storage into consideration, though.\n\nCONVENIENCE\n\nOne of the big things that I hear touted about Glass is convenience over a traditional smartphone, thereby justifying the price. But let's break that down a bit.\n\n* I can't play games on Glass very easily, such as Tetris or Angry Birds that I can easily play on my phone with the touch screen. These are games that sort of require a touch screen in order to play effectively.\n* The voice feature is nice, and is very responsive, but what if I want to send a text to someone and don't want everyone around me to know what I'm saying? What if I want to visit a website but not have everyone around me know? I could use the touchpad on the side, but it's not as quick as the keypad on my phone. Even if I got used to it, it's still probably still not as quick.\n* Glass isn't a phone in and of itself, functioning more like a handsfree device. So this means that I'll have to carry around my regular phone in addition to Glass. So that means yet another device in addition to my phone that I have to charge every night and find a place to keep. But I can't keep it in my pocket like my phone, since it's glasses, and they might get crushed. I don't have a purse. And I'm certainly not wearing it clipped to my collar like a tourist because it might fall off my shirt and get smashed. I'm not wearing it on top of my head because that will look really stupid and, again, might fall off. So I either have to wear it all the time, or get some loose, big pockets to put it in.\n\nSo there goes the whole convenience argument right out the window. I'd rather just take two seconds to pull my phone out of my pocket whenever I need to use it than have the \"convenience\" of having it all right in front of my eyeballs all the time but at the cost of not having anything to do with the freaking thing when I'm not using it. Also, I'll still have to use my regular phone for many things, and still have to pull it out of my pocket when I need it anyway. \n\nWhat else has Glass promised? Browsing through Google's app store, the list of apps available doesn't seem too impressive compared with apps already available on a standard phone. \"Augmented reality?\" So, like, I'm walking down the street and see Yelp reviews for all the restaurants appear in front of my eyes? Or see driving directions pop up right in front of me?\n\nThat would be great if I ever actually went anywhere, but I've lived in the same town for years and pretty much know all the good restaurants and know my way around already. I go on a road trip maybe once a year and I just use the GPS in my car. Works great.\n\nWhat else? Night vision goggles? Uh, okay, if I ever need to see in the dark and don't happen to have a flashlight or the light on my phone, that'll be great.\n\nSo, all you glass enthusiasts out there, please tell me what the appeal is of Google Glass.\n\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: I was raised agnostic. Sometimes I wish I was Christian, and have attended church but I cannot find it in myself to believe. Appeal to my logical side and CMV. + \n + I apologize for yet another religious CMV once again, but I think this would be interesting for me.\n\nSo growing up, my parents never introduced me to religion, and we've never talked about it. I don't even know if my parents are religious. Being fairly young and growing up in the age of the internet, I frequently sought out information on the internet, and learned all about different types of religions, conflicts based on religion, the basic teachings of those different religions, etc. \n\nHowever, a lot of the stuff I found in my early age, being the internet, was very atheist-biased and hated on religion, and that has really stuck with me over the years. I came into middle school a devout atheist, thinking anyone who was religious was beneath me. However, I quickly made many religious friends, from Christians (Non-denominational, Catholic, Mormon), to Muslims and Jews. They are some of the nicest, awesomest people I have ever met and never judged me for being an atheist or tried to sway my views. I learned to be a lot more open to religion, and identified as agnostic early in high school. I am now a senior. The concept of the Abrahamic religions (Christianity specifically), the afterlife, and morals have always comforted me and sometimes my friends would invite me to church, like if it came up while we were hanging out that they had to go to church on Sunday or whatever and they asked if I wanted to come along. Usually I'd say no thanks, but sometimes I'd take them up on their offer and just join in on prayer and worship. I think it would be awesome to be a Christian and have that camaraderie, comfort and love of the community, but even after all the research and going to church, I simply cannot find it in myself to believe the Bible.\n\nI'm sure you all have seen the endless points on the Theist vs Atheist debate, and I won't tire you by listing them all, but here are my main issues I have based on my admittedly limited knowledge of the Bible:\n\n- Creationism and certain views that contradict plausible science that has been proven again and again.\n\n- The fact that there is such a harsh distinction between the two possible afterlives: endless punishment or endless paradise, and the fact that someone evil like Ted Bundy, \"confessed\" and apologized for his sins before execution, would be sent to Heaven and a virtuous, amazing human being like Bill Gates would be sent to Hell because he is an atheist.\n\n- Anti-gay, anti-contraception and other repressive movements in the name of religion.\n\n- The fact that there are so many religions, and within those, many different denominations and inconsistencies. How can one possible say their belief is the absolute truth, held above the others?\n\n- Various miracles and stories (like Noah's Ark) in the Bible are hard to believe.\n\nHere's what I DO find plausible:\n\n- There is a God. Maybe it is not an Abrahamic God or Pagan Gods, but with the vast scale of the Universe and the beauty of life, it is not out of the question that there is a higher power.\n\n- There is an afterlife. As humans, we have so much emotion and complex thought that it baffles me to think that it all disappears once we die.\n\nSo, please, do not take offense to what I am saying. I am open to religion, and would love to hear respectable arguments from both sides of the Theism split. Thank you!", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "I don't believe we should always protect endangered species. CMV + \n + The US Fish and Wildlife Service uses 5 factors to determine whether a species is threatened: \n\n* present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of habitat\n* overutilization for commercial, recreational, etc. purposes\n* disease or predation\n* inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms\n* other natural or man-made factors\n\nMost of these I am fine with.

This would greatly inflate the cost of construction in affected areas and have zero impact on the effects of WNS on the bat population. Yes, the bat population might be greatly affected by this disease, but something else will spring up to takes its place (likely other bats with better immune systems).

You register the guns, and you license people who choose to play by the rules (like Xavier and his school).\n\nSure, there will be other, more criminal, elements who will choose to go their own way (Magneto and his ilk), but that's where my argument comes in: for those mutants who choose to not play by the rules, they must be reacted to with nothing less than the entirety of our power; whether that means incarceration in specially designed units meant to pacify them, or utter destruction by the sentinels, they are nothing less than a *threat* and must be dealt with swiftly.\n\nI mean, at their basis, these mutations possessed by these mutants make many of them nothing less than *weapons of mass destruction* at best and potentially apocalyptic monsters, at worst.\n\nI mean, here's a rundown of a few:\n\n**Charles Xavier:** Largely considered the world's most powerful telepath, able to influence and control the thoughts and actions of anyone, anywhere across the globe, *just with his mind.* What's stopping him from controlling the staff of a nuclear missile silo in Siberia, and launching a strike on D.C.?\n\n**Magneto:** the media-styled \"master of magnetism\"; able to control most of the world's [metallic] armaments simply with a flick of the wrist, if he so desired, and has a *terrible* means streak, and a hatred towards humans.

They take up less space, are cheaper to build, and offer more privacy to the user. However, at least in the US, there are often two of them, one for men and one for women, and I really don't see the point of this practice.

Natural and supernatural (or even two supernatural) causes can contradict themselves, so even testing for them can not reliably support the validity of natural laws. Therefore any assumptions about ~~our~~that universe can't rely on natural laws being true.\n\nSuch a universe is no different in effect to a solipsistic universe, in which we can't rely on anything that we perceive existing outside of our mind. Just like our senses can deceive us in ways that we can never recognize, so can supernatural causes.

Like crime, murder, and theft, racism is one of those qualities that can never be completely eliminated, only suppressed via government force.

The vast majority of Libertarians are against any sort of social conformity (excluding social expectations on the concept of their property). \n\n\nWhat will actually happen if racism (in terms of discrimination on housing, employment, and public services) is legalized, is that the free market will react to the demand of racist services. Markets will react by opening up segregated shops and restaurants. Homeowner associations will open up segregated housing units and neighborhoods. As society becomes more segregated, racism will become normalized once again and we will be right back in the social situation of 1950.

{"input": "I believe that when people try to differentiate between 'real' and 'fake' nerds, they are using arbitrary distinctions, being close minded and being hypocritical. CMV. + \n + I am a nerd. I have played Magic the Gathering, League of Legends, Dungeons and Dragons and have taken the time to fully understand the rules of the Game of Thrones board game. I love the shows Battlestar Galactica and Game of Thrones. I enjoy philosophy, comics and read a fair amount of fantasy books. When I was younger, like many young people I went through periods where I felt like a social pariah.\n\nThere are also other ways that I am nerdy that most people wouldn't consider the norm - I love elimination based competitive reality TV shows (such as Survivor or Big Brother). I watch the shows analytically and I'm fascinated by watching the human psychology that people display when they are on them. I can tell you an insane amount of information about these two shows. \n\nFor these reasons I think it's a fair assertion to say that I am a nerd. It's neither a badge of honour for me, or something I am ashamed of. It's just a fact.\n\nBut I am also someone who has tried hard to learn social skills, invests time into maintaining fulfilling relationships with friends and family, and I try to maintain my physical appearance. Also, despite being an introvert I try to do something social at least once or twice a week. I hate metal and like a lot of popular music I hear on the radio. I'm not remotely interested in anime. And I have overcome my former social anxiety. A lot of people would  have a problem with the fact that I identify myself as a nerd for these reasons. \n\nA lot of nerds out there spend a great deal of their time spewing rage at people who do not meet their internal definition of what it means to be a nerd. It's like people believe some arbitrary distinction based on their preferences makes them part of a nerd elite and gives them licence to adopt and attitude of condescension and vitriol when addressing a 'fake nerd' like me (interestingly enough, I have experience more instantaneous judgement for being a 'fake nerd' than I ever have for being a gay male). I don't mean to say everyone is like this; Many are much more polite about it but still seem to get irritated when someone they hadn't deemed as nerdy shares with them that they are also a nerd. And I know I am painting with broad strokes here and that there are many nerds who don't have this attitude at all. But those that do? Frankly, I don't get it. \n\nThe situation is even worse for girls. There are tons of instances on the internet where an attractive girl will design and intricate cosplay only to get ridiculed by people who assume that since she is attractive she can't possibly be a real nerd (seriously, designing a well made cosplay takes a lot of skill which I do not poseess and I have a lot of respect for people who do). In going to a convention, these girls took the time design a kickass costume, support a 'nerdy' industry and meet/greet the people working behind the scenes. Why shouldn't this allow them to qualify as nerds? \n\nI also find this phenomenon to be fairly specific to nerd culture. While there are exceptions to any rule, I have never seen an actor ridicule someone who is taking their first improv lessons for being a phony. And I don't hear athletes get pissed when someone with a different body type claims to be athletic. But I see this kind of mentality quite frequently when someone claims to be a nerd for reading Harry Potter (one of my best friends travels internationally so she can go to the major conventions, and that takes dedication).\n\nThe funniest thing about all of this is the hypocrisy. In nerd culture, fake nerds are disliked because they are assumed to be more focussed on the social status granted by being a nerd than the actual interests associated with being a nerd. But if 'real nerds' are so concerned about the social status being untarnished by fakers, aren't they ultimately even more guilty of wanting to be a nerd for the wrong reasons than the people they are criticizing?\n\nI find this attitude to be problematic. I think it's rude, divisive and unfounded. I think that people who decide to think this way involuntarily alienate themselves socially and that everyone would be better off if they just understood that different people have different preferences. I am interested to see what people in this sub have to say. I think this attitude is very prevelent in most subs on reddit but I find this sub to be much more mature.\n\nWhen people try to classify people as 'real' and 'fake' nerds, they are using arbitrary distinctions, being close minded and being hypocritical.

{"input": "CMV: I reject Blackstone's formulation + \n + That is, I disagree with the statement \"It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer.\" Benjamin Franklin famously repeated it and upped the ante--he said that it was better 100 guilty people should go free than that one innocent should suffer. This principle is key to most modern justice systems, and is intimately tied to high standards of evidence and a strong presumption of innocence.\n\nThe problem is, letting a guilty criminal go free causes the innocent to suffer. It keeps the victim, or victim's family, from gaining closure or a sense of justice, not to mention any kind of restitution. More importantly, it leaves a criminal on the streets, where he can offend again. A crime going unpunished will also encourage other potential criminals, as this will show how easy it is to commit the crime in question with impunity.\n\nTake a murder. If one innocent person is convicted of murder, his or her life is more or less destroyed. Of course that's regrettable. But if ten or, all the more so, 100 murderers walk free, a certain number of them will re-offend, and a major disincentive to other murderers (the fear of punishment) will be undermined. The net result of this will almost certainly be more murders, which will mean the destruction of more than one innocent life. Clearly this is the worse outcome.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not quite advocating a presumption of guilt, but I think the presumption of innocence should be weaker. Juries shouldn't be told to look for \"proof beyond reasonable doubt,\" something like \"a strong likelihood\" of guilt should be sufficient for a conviction.\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: I think a guaranteed basic income would lead to massive inflation and exacerbate most of the problems it is intended to solve + \n + Universal Basic Income seems to be a popular idea on reddit. Supposedly it allows us to solve poverty while reducing the size of government. We give everyone money with no discrimination and we don't have to tell them how to spend it, so food stamps and unemployment and whatever else just go away.\n\nI posit that UBI would lead to rampant inflation on certain essential goods and services (most specifically with regards to rent and mortgage) which would in turn lead to various price setting measures and restrictions on what the UBI could be used for; meaning we would still have the same types of government controls advocates of the UBI claim it would remove.\n\nSo take housing which I think is the most obvious example. Housing is a limited resource. We can only squeeze so many people into an area. Therefore there will always be a limited supply and landlords and bankers will be in a position to take advantage of the influx of cash now coming in through UBI. Even though people will have more money, they will still be spending the majority of it on rent or mortgages since the prices will go up.\n\nIn response to this situation I can see one of two scenarios playing out:\n\n1. Governments start exercising pricing controls on goods that are becoming too expensive in order to maintain a reasonable UBI.\n\n2. The UBI doesn't increase to match inflation (the same way minimum wage doesn't increase) and the system ends up not being effective anymore.\n\nAlso, even with UBI you will still have some poor people who stay poor because they spend all their money on stupid stuff like drugs and Dr. Dre headphones or whatever. Even if this is a minority the ones who don't like giving their tax money away will use them as an example the same way they do now for welfare subsidies and food stamps. \n\nI'm sorry, but I just don't see any problem being solved here.

I'm not talking about paparazzi, which in my opinion is closer to stalking or harassment. I'm also not referring to government surveillance, which can involve tracking or data collection beyond a simple photograph or video recording. I'm specifically talking about a scenario like this:\n\nPerson A is walking in a public park with lots of people around. Person B is sitting on a park bench. Person A sees a bird in a tree he/she would like to photograph. This tree is directly behind the park bench person B is sitting on. Person A raises the camera to photograph the bird, at which point person B objects to having their photo taken, rather than simply obscuring their face or moving. \n\nNow I understand that it may make people uncomfortable knowing that they are the subject being captured on film, but if you are willingly in a public place with many people around, I feel that it's understood that many pictures may be taken, and that you may be in some of them.

Being photographed does not damage a person in any way, other than possibly making them uncomfortable for a few minutes. It's similar in a way to being offended at an interracial or gay couple in a public place in my mind; just because you don't like it doesn't mean everyone else has to change their behavior for you. \n\nBut maybe I'm missing something, so Reddit feel free to CMV!\n\n\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

I believe that most of the time, when this argument is used, it is either protecting children from something they do not need protection from and often are things that should be actively discussed with children.\n\nFurthermore, when this argument is used to advocate for something that actually protects children, the detriment to society is generally larger than the benefit for children, e.g. even if drug usage does increase among teenagers after legalization (which I strongly doubt), the negatives of prohibition far outweigh the consequences of more teens doing drugs.\n\nNote: Arguments for increasing socialized benefits do not fall under this argument, as they are beneficial to all of society, not just children.

{"input": "CMV: I think the psychological aspects of addiction being an 'a disease' is BS. Rather it is a matter of self-control. + \n + I should begin by stating I am getting a PhD in social psychology, so although I'm not well versed in the addiction literature, I know a thing or two about biology and psychology. Feel free to reference articles as I will gladly read them.\n\nSecondly, I am not discounting the physiological aspects of addiction. I recognize that once addicted, one's body has a hard time dealing with withdrawal. In fact, stopping cold turkey in some cases has negative consequences, and as such weaning needs to be done.\n\nThird, I'm not suggesting that there aren't psychological aspects to addiction. I know the literature argues quite persuasively that contextual cues can send off physiological reactions that make people want drugs more.\nFourth, my mother suffered with an addiction for a long time. She finally got help and has been clean for a few years, so it's not like this isn't a sensitive topic for me.\n\nFifth, I'm not saying drugs should be criminalized. Rather, I suggest people should be given the chance to go to mental health facilities. Quitting drugs is a hard thing to do, no question about it.\n\nOK - what I argue then, is that addiction, is simply a matter of 'just not doing it/taking them, etc.' As mentioned, sometimes this needs to be controlled and weaned, but ultimately it's about 'just not taking them any more.'\n\nAn analogy I can come up with is that of a 48 hour fast. Getting off drugs would be like the misery of a 48 hour fast, but one that lasts for a long time. It would be miserable and difficult, but one could do it, if they really had to and it wouldn't kill them. Now, just as one might need a glass of water in the middle to survive, I recognize that one might need wean themselves. However ultimately, many people would have a hard time committing to a 48 hour fast, just as people have a hard time committing to quitting drugs. The main difference here, is that as one stops doing drugs for longer, the easier it becomes.\n\nPeople might want drugs, and that want might never go away, but Is that all addiction is? want of drugs? If you can physically keep people away from drugs they won't do it again, and if an individual can keep him/herself away from drugs, he/she won't do it again. I don't see a difference.\n\nAs a second, less pertinent point, The general treatment for addiction variants is often the twelve step programs or variants of, [which has been shown to be not be better than other programs](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005032.pub2/abstract) , not to mention the seemingly opposing idea that one has to 'give up control' which any literature I've read would suggest that such a belief would make people not take responsibility.\n\nSo ultimately, my concern is that, addiction is not a mental health disease. It's a lack of self-control. It's not an easy thing to do, like staying away from a 2nd slice of chocolate cake, but more like staying away from a glass of water after 48 hours without it.", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: Professional gaming is as valid/respectable a career choice as any other professional athlete and should be treated as such. + \n + (I'm writing this from the perspective of a Starcraft fan - So I won't be referencing much LoL or DotA stats here)\n\nIn countries like the United States, Canada, and most European nations, the choice to pursue a career in professional gaming is often looked down on within society. It is viewed by friends and family as a waste of time and \"just a game\". While a good football player can get a free ride through college, a professional gamer is usually forced to live well below the poverty line in an attempt to chase their dream. \n\nThere are systems in place to assist most professional athletes - scholarships, visa's (only a handful of pro gamers have ever been issued a visa, which has caused issues within tournament circuits), and better legal representation/protection in contract disputes.\n\nAdditional info:\n\n-Pro gaming tournaments such as LCS (League of Legends), WCS (Starcraft 2), and TI (DotA 2) bring in hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of viewers and yet due to the poor view the general population has for gaming, fans and players are typically laughed at for their choice in entertainment.\n\n-In South Korea, their culture is much more accepting of gaming and professional gamers, which has created an environment that allows their players to excel in ways foreign (ie non-Korean) players are unable to. This disparity has created a cycle which is preventing the foreign gaming scene from growing due to a lack of representation in major tournaments. Our best players (such as Scarlett, HuK and Naniwa) have had to move to Korea to train as the proper facilities do not exist here in the west. \n\nMy argument is that if our culture was more accepting of professional gaming, the proper infrastructure to support pro gaming teams could be built within NA and EU, allowing a better representation within the pro-gaming community. This would lead to higher viewer numbers and therefore a better ROI for investors, creating a more profitable business model. However due to the negative light pro gaming is viewed in (often referred to as a type of addiction rather than a career choice - in [this](http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2012/08/tech/gaming.series/korea.html) CNN article, they ensure to always use the word athlete in quotation marks, a subtle yet fairly clear mocking of the culture) the community is forced to remain small, and will eventually die off due to this.", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "The Iraq War was both just and necessary. CMV. + \n + Alright, I think it's time that I had a proper discussion about this. **I firmly believe that the decision to move Iraq, the Middle East, and the region into a post-Saddam Hussein era was a moral and legal imperative for the United States and the international community and that force of arms was the only feasible way to accomplish that.** That's my position, in a sentence. I hope the post title doesn't misrepresent that.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1) There are four reasons for which a sovereign state may lose or sacrifice its sovereignty under international law.\n\n* It has invaded or occupied a neighboring state.\n* It has violated or proposed to violate the Genocide Convention\n* It has displayed promiscuous and frivolous behavior with (or plainly violated) the Non-Proliferation Treaty\n* It has actively harbored internationally wanted terrorists and gangsters\n\nIraq is the only modern state to have violated all four of those. It had attempted to annex Kuwait and make it part of Iraq, as well as engage in a pointless border dispute with Iran that cost thousands of lives. Saddam had issued a direct order to exterminate the Kurdish people of Iraq. He did this using biological and chemical weapons. Further, he maintained a department of state for the concealment of nuclear weapons. Although none were found during the invasion, he had stated that he wished to rebuild the nuclear program once the sanctions ceased. Finally, his country was the homebase of Abu-Nidal, Zarqawi, and the Achille Lauro hijackers from the PLF. \n\nThis meant that the international community had a duty, as well as a right, to remove the regime from power by any justifiable means, including and up to use of deadly force.\n\n2) Saddam Hussein and his crime family had sole ownership of all of the natural resources and imports to Iraq. The sanctions were in effect because he was able to use his power to keep the Iraqi people in his jaws, while they starved. Furthermore, he was in possession of some of the largest oil reserves in the world. He was able to do as he liked with them, and he was the sole profiteer of them. This was, in my opinion, an outrageous offense to anyone who cared about the economic well-being of both the country and the Middle East as a whole.\n\n3) Saddam Hussein only ever called a cabinet meeting when he ordered one half of the cabinet to shoot the other half, sealing them in complicity with his regime. A person could be publicly executed for spilling their coffee on the newspaper that had Saddam's face on it, after which the person's family would be billed for the bullets. People died horrible deaths every day for no other reason than the egotistical glorification of a known psychopath and criminal. Morally, an international community that had any regard for decency could not stand by while this regime behaved like that.\n\nNote: this is **not** an endorsement of the Bush administration. I believe wholly that their execution of the war was abysmal. Their reasons as stated to the American electorate were appallingly cheap and demagogic. They didn't level with us on any of the goings-on in the war while it was happening. They may have even committed a war crime or two. But, that isn't what this question is about.\n\nThis question is not about 9/11. My case would have been exactly the same in 1998 (with the exception of Zarqawi, I believe). In fact, it would have been almost complete during the Kuwait War. This question is not about mistakes that were made. It's solely about whether we, as citizens of a global community, were willing to stand by with our guns holstered while our Iraqi brothers and sisters were under the control of the Saddam Hussein regime.\n\nCMV.\n\n\n1) Some of you guys have had the best arguments I've yet heard against my position. Definitely the best on reddit. I'm gonna keep coming back here, for sure, and not just for my own post. Thank you, sincerely, and keep them coming.\n\n2) Having said that, I feel the need to make something abundantly clear: my contention is not \"America has made nothing but good foreign policy decisions ever since the Declaration\". It's also not \"Bush did the right thing during his execution of the war\". It's also not \"Bush Sr. was right\". It's also not \"Bush Sr. was wrong\". It's not \"X politician made Y statement and that proves me right\". I'm very deliberately **making my own case**, separate from any case anybody else made. I'm serious: if I get one more post that starts with \"BUT BUSH SAID...\" I'm going to go all Bane-backbreaker on my laptop.\n\n3) But seriously, keep it up.\n\n4) &lt;3\n\n5) Also, I'm going to bed right now.

{"input": "CMV: Civil asset forfeiture should be abolished. + \n + Civil asset forfeiture is a legal proceeding where someone's property is accused of being connected to a crime, and the government takes the property.  John Oliver did [a rant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kEpZWGgJks&amp;list=PLmKbqjSZR8TZa7wyVoVq2XMHxxWREyiFc) about it last week, but I want to emphasize that my view is not based on a John Oliver rant.\n\nProblems with civil forfeiture\n\n* It is essentially a criminal punishment without the protections of criminal procedure.\n\nCivil forfeiture takes property from someone based on the accusation of a crime.  It is essentially a fine, and to assess a fine, the government needs to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, with the presumption of innocence on the part of the accused, and with all the other good stuff we guarantee in criminal procedure (right to remain silent, right to an attorney, right to call witnesses, right to confront one's accuser, etc.).   As an example of the abuses of process, in Philadelphia, prosecutors seize people out of their homes, and won't agree to let them back in unless they waive innocent owner defenses. \n\n* Civil forfeiture creates terrible incentives for police.\n\nCivil forfeiture means that police will be more interested in going after money in many cases than going after crime.  Often, they will go after money in lieu of going after crime.  Many people will have their assets seized without being charged with a crime, which seems perverse.  Further, police departments and DA's offices get to keep the proceeds of the funds they seize.  This means they have a huge incentive to seize aggressively and often illegally.  It would be wildly unconstitutional to pay police officers per arrest.  But we essentially do that with forfeiture funds going to police department budgets, or police pension funds.  Depositing the forfeiture proceeds to the police pension fund is literally paying police based on what they take from citizens.\n\n* Criminal forfeiture does the job in cases of real need.\n\nThere is an alternate proceeding for seizing assets - criminal forfeiture.  A criminal forfeiture allows police to seize property at the time of arrest like a civil forfeiture.  But importantly, it requires that the defendant be convicted of a crime, and that the judge rule on the property in question being connected to that crime, for the government to keep the property.\n\n\nFor the Philadelphia case about waiving defenses, see [this lawsuit](http://www.ij.org/images/pdf_folder/private_property/philadelphia-forfeiture/philadelphia-forfeiture-complaint-8-11-14.pdf) against the Police and DA's office there.

That's understandable. It's a big part of the reason that adaptations are leading to splits in books (while I wouldn't be able to justify the Hobbit being three movies, I can justify splitting Mockingjay and Deathly Hallows, as they are long books that would be impossible to adequately adapt into a single movie).\n\nAs for the Harry Potter movie series as a whole, I find many faults. Some come from the larger books towards the end, in which it's understandable that everything can't fit. But even from the start, the adaptations were lacking.\n\n[This image](https://i.imgur.com/3KkXXme.png) and it's [corresponding thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/2qqbth/book_hermione_vs_movie_hermione/) on /r/harrypotter adqueately express my distates at the way Ron and Hermione's characters were adapted in the movies. Ron is less loyal, Hermione is less human, and the trio is less strong because of it.\n\nGinny, Dobby, and several other characters also received bad treatment. They were cut out of some of the middle movies because of time constraints, and so developments like Dobby's death or Ginny's relationship with Harry lack the same amount of gravity.\n\nIn the later books, things got worse. Entire plotlines and characterizations were lost. Some of the magic that made the world so deep was cut. We never learn that James, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew were the Marauders and made the map. We don't even learn that Pettigrew was called Wormtail by his friends. The first time we hear the name is from Voldemort.\n\nInstead of a variety of different spells, there were like 3 that were ever used in fights. The duels were abysmal.\n\nThe last movie especially was butchery. By splitting the book up, it gave them the opportunity to do the Battle of Hogwarts justice. Instead they butchered almost everything, especially in the final moments when Harry defeats Voldemort.\n\nWith that exception, most of those issues were due to time constraints. That's why, a Game of Thrones-style adaptation of 10 1-hour episodes per season would have been a better treatment.\n\nThe only argument I see against it is that the early books don't have enough substance.

I'm including myself in that analysis, of course. People live their lives looking for love, family, a good career, happiness among other things and even when for some miracle they find all the things they want, they eventually die. And after that, all of those efforts and hope mean nothing anymore, because you don't exist and the good effect of the things you lived for can no longer be felt, since your consciousness is gone. It's like you, or the conscious being behind your self-awareness and imagination is less important than a rock, since it's more likely that it will exist longer than you will, and although it's going to make less of a difference in the universe, it's not like you're going to get to feel better about it.

{"input": "CMV: It is morally justified to attack cops because the police are enforcers of an unjust, immoral system + \n + Basically, this argument predicates on two things:\n\n1. acceptance of self-defense as a valid reason for violence, which I think is a fair assumption of most if not all people here.\n2. the legal system in question (for the sake of argument, let's stick to the American one) has moral or ethical failings\n\nI'll illustrate my point with an analogy:\n\nLet's say a Gestapo member stops a Jew who had recently robbed some cigars in Nazi Germany (let's say this is prior to the implementation of the Final Solution) for walking in the middle of the street. Maybe the Gestapo member is super nice. Maybe he even has some Jewish friends. Maybe he's just doing his damn job. Yea, walking in the street is illegal, and so is stealing cigars. But who, other than neo-Nazi scum, would say that the Jew would be wrong to punch the Gestapo? Sure, legally the Gestapo's in the right and the Jew is in the wrong. But the law itself and the society they're in has institutionalized a systemic form of discrimination against the Jew. The Jew would have no obligations whatsoever to respect the authority of the Gestapo. Yes, it might be dumb to punch the Gestapo- I won't deny that. The Gestapo will likely kill the Jew now. But was it morally wrong to hit someone who is enforcing a morally repugnant system? Of course not. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter how legally justified the Gestapo's actions are, they're still trying to enforce a morally repugnant system that specifically targets the Jewish people. Therefore it's self defense.\n\nUnless you deny that American law and society are systematically discriminating against poor people and black people, the analogy holds.\n\nBut even if you don't think that, insofar as American law and society are promoting *any* kind of injustice, then the analogy holds, because then cops become the ground-soldiers and enforcers of that injustice.\n\nTherefore, a cop who operates in an unjust framework is automatically waging war against you. Attacking him is morally justifiable as an act of self defense.\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "I believe that loyalty to people (such as friends or partners) or sports teams is irrational. CMV. + \n + There's a permeating belief that loyalty is a virtue when it comes to interpersonal relationships. Sticking by a friend no matter what, staying loyal to a lover, etc. I can agree that, when your friend or partner is going through a significant amount of adversity (such as getting fired or an illness) you're, in a sense, obligated to stay with him/her. After all, we often say that friends should be friends through thick and thin and that, when two people get married, they should stay together for better or for worse and in sickness and in health. And I do agree with that.  \n\nI also agree that loyalty shouldn't be unconditional. If a friend or partner is neglectful, abusive, or treats you badly, you're perfectly justified in ending your relationship with that person.  \n\nHowever, if you have a better option, I see nothing wrong in \"upgrading\". For example, I see nothing wrong with ending a relationship with a friend in favor of another person if he's considered to have higher social status, be it attractiveness, popularity, wealth, etc. The film *Toy Story* provides a good example of this. Initially, all of Andy's toys like Woody and hold him in high esteem, but they quickly realize that Buzz has more to offer. He has a more interesting personality, he's newer, he's got more \"features\", and so on. They eventually decide that they'd rather associate with Buzz instead of Woody. Another example could be how, in *Mean Girls*, Gretchen and Karen eventually choose to make Cady the leader of their group in place of Regina when they realize that Cady has more to offer in terms of social status than Regina. No one faults Karen, Gretchen, or the rest of Andy's toys for upgrading. Similarly, no one would fault you for, say, upgrading to a better car or a nicer apartment.  \n\nThe same applies to romantic relationships, including marriages. Yes, provided you have no better alternatives and you're getting everything you want out of the relationship and nothing you don't want (such as abuse or mistreatment), one could say you're obligated to stay in that relationship. But if you have an opportunity to upgrade, I see nothing wrong in doing so.  \n\nFor example, if I was married and my wife met someone wealthier or better looking than me, I think my wife would be perfectly justified in ending her relationship with me to pursue a relationship with that new person. In fact, I'd want her to do so. If I truly loved her, I'd want her to have the best. I wouldn't want to hold her back. Similarly, I don't think I'd be in the wrong for ending my marriage to her and pursuing a relationship with a wealthier or more beautiful woman, and I'd expect her to encourage me to pursue a better partner.  \n\nSimilarly, and this may seem a bit trivial, but I don't see what's wrong in ending your association with and support for a given sports team in favor of a more successful one. People want to associate with the best, and if their current teams can't provide that with them, it's only rational for them to change loyalties.\n\ntl;dr: I don't think ending a relationship (platonic or romantic) in order to create a relationship with a better partner (better meaning funnier, better looking, wealthier, etc.) is wrong.  \n\nCMV.", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: There is no justifiable reason for me to get angry about what this driver did. + \n + Yesterday morning on my way to work I witnessed a fellow driver break a traffic law and it made me quite angry for a few minutes. \n\nIt only made me angry for a few minutes and I hadn't thought of it again until I passed the same spot this morning and was reminded of it, and thought it would be interesting to post a CMV on the emotions I had after witnessing the moving violation. I think many (most?) of us have a strong emotional reaction to witnessing a fellow citizen break a rule of some sort, depending on the situation, and the subconscious reasons why are interesting to me. So here we go...\n\n**Area Description:** I was stuck in traffic on the freeway off ramp that I exit the freeway on every morning. The off ramp ends with a stop sign before you can merge onto the main street, and the main street traffic has a traffic signal just before the off ramp so if that light is red there are no cars and everybody can exit the freeway off ramp, and when the light is green there are cars passing by and the off ramp gets backed up for a minute or two until the light turns red again. So it's common for the off ramp to be backed up for a minute or two and then immediately clear up.\n\n**[Here](http://i.imgur.com/0qcVpau.png) is a diagram.** The blue markings represent car drivers that are following the law. The red marking represents the car driver that committed the moving violation. The green markings represent the main street cross traffic that is present or clear depending on the traffic light just off screen. And the yellow markings are just the cross traffic on the other side of the off ramp. \n\n**Moving Violation Description:** So while all the blue cars are stopped and backed up around the curve of the off ramp, one car pulls out from the line of stopped cars and drives around the side of the off ramp next to all the cars, thereby enabling he or she to merge onto the main street (green) traffic without waiting like the rest of us. The off ramp is wide enough to do this without problem; it is a very wide ramp, but there is no question that it is a single lane. It would be damn near impossible to mistake it for two lanes. \n\nNow, the blue cars were all stopped because the green cars had oncoming cross traffic. But right when the red car pulled out to jump the line, the green car traffic eased up. Both the red car and the first blue car in line pulled onto the main street at the same time... it being a two lane street so they each pulled into a different lane. The remaining blue cars all pulled onto the main street one by one after that.\n\nWhile witnessing this, I was initially upset for a couple of minutes. I wanted to honk and flip him or her off. (I did not.) But upon thinking about it there really isn't any reason for me to be angry about this.\n\n**Reasons this shouldn't make me angry:**\n\n* Nobody was in danger -- There are absolutely no pedestrians around the area. The red car driver did stop before merging, and only pulled onto the main street once it was clear and safe to do so. The blue cars weren't in danger of being side swiped by the red car as the lane was so wide. **(Edit [7hrs after posting]: I realized something that counters this point of mine and just for fun I'll tell you all.... the red car was blocking the blue car's view of oncoming traffic! That certainly makes it less safe.)**\n\n* Nobody got delayed because of it -- All the blue cars were able to merge onto the main street at the same pace they would have if the red car didn't commit this violation. The main street is two lanes, so the red car just took a wide turn into the far lane, so none of the blue cars had to wait for the red car and the red car didn't jump ahead of any of the blue cars.\n\n* Yes, he or she did break a rule, but so? -- I'm not the type to cling rigidly to rules and be upset about people breaking a rule simply because they broke a rule and defied authority. I'm one of those who generally thinks it's okay to break a rule if nobody is harmed. I don't cling to conventions and rules just for the sake of conventions and rules, so that in conjunction with my other two points above should make me not upset by this driver's actions.\n\n* Witnessing a person this impatient and frustrated is uncomfortable, but not reason to be angry -- I did realize while thinking about this that one of the reasons it causes such palpable emotions is because what the truth of what I actually witnessed here besides \"driver commits moving violation\" is \"driver becomes so impatient and frustrated that he or she manifests that frustration into action.\" And it is uncomfortable and perhaps even a little scary to witness a person become so upset that they perform actions out of frustration and impatience. But that would be reason for me to feel uncomfortable or scared, not angry. I felt angry. I wanted to honk and flip him off, not run to safety or get away from him. I was angry, not scared.\n\nSo, despite the fact that I was angry upon witnessing this, I contend now that there was no justifiable reason for me to be angry... was there?

{"input": "CMV: The deaths of 42 youths for verbally assaulting Elisha in the Old Testament is unjustifiable + \n + A little while back, I had a very interesting discussion with two missionaries about morality and the Bible. We eventually got onto the story of Elisha and how a prayer he issued led to the deaths of 42 young people who were taunting him. The passage from the Bible is as follows:\n\n**\"2 Kings 2:23-24 New International Version (NIV)**\n\n**Elisha Is Jeered**\n\n23 From there Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, some boys came out of the town and jeered at him. \u201cGet out of here, baldy!\u201d they said. \u201cGet out of here, baldy!\u201d \n\n24 He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the Lord. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the boys.\"\n\n[(Source)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+2%3A23-24&amp;version=NIV;KJV)\n\nThe missionaries argued that one problem with the above passage is that 'boys' could potentially refer to anybody up to their twenties, but I'm struggling to see how this makes their deaths morally justifiable. Even if we assume that they were young men acting aggressively and threatening an innocent man, I do not believe that their actions proportionally warranted a violent death at the hands of two bears. \n\nAt an even deeper level though, the passage seems to have several implications for the moral character of God himself. I argued that a kind and loving God might instead choose to grant the 42 youths an epiphany which would lead them to the realisation that taunting people is unacceptable. If nothing else, God could have defended Elisha **if** the youths actually started to use violence against him. The missionaries' rebuttal was that such an act would have been an abridgement of free will, but given that God already decided to abridge their free will by taking away their lives, I'm not sure that this lets God off the hook.\n\nI've read several different interpretations of this story from various Christian websites but I don't accept the widely-accepted conclusion that the aggressive behaviour demonstrated by these youths presented sufficient grounds for their death. I'm therefore highly curious to see if anybody can provide a justification for God's actions in this particular part of the Bible.

{"input": "CMV: In urban environments, cats have the Freedom to Roam. + \n + (and no, you don't have the right to shoot them)\n\nI live in an old urban neighborhood. Cats have roamed these streets and backyards since time immemorial.  To me, they have become part of the urban \"background noise\". They mostly just get on with their cat business, and let humans get on with their human business.\n\nBut recently a new, intolerant breed of neighbor has moved in. People who complain about cats taking short cuts across their balcony. People who demand that all cat owners must lock their cats indoors, animal welfare be damned. People who even threaten to poison and shoot the felines. \n\nTheir argument basically boils down to this:\n\n**Get aaarf mah praaahperty**\n\nBut I would like to offer 4 counterarguments:\n\n**\"Easements\"**. It is a common misunderstanding that owning a piece of land gives you absolute rights over the land. But in practice, ownership rights are always conditional. That is especially true in an urban environment. \n\nI own an apartment, and there are all sorts of intrusions and \"trespasses\" I have to put up with: The toxic fumes from automobile owners driving past my house. The noise of the neighbor's baby screeching all night and robbing me of my sleep. \nThe unpleasant smells of my downstairs neighbors grilling kebabs. The light pollution from the nearby football stadium. Do I have to right to sue the automobile owners because of air pollution? Do I have the right to force my neighbor to pay for the costs of sound-proofing my apartment? No. Why? Because that is part of the deal I accepted when I decided to live in a city.\n\nCats are part of the urban ecosystem. It is in their nature to be curious and to be free spirits. If you move into an urban environment, you implicitly accept to share space with them. If you absolutely want no cats in your yard, you are always free to cat-proof your property.\n\nNow, some would say that things like automobiles are \"essential\" and that pets are a \"luxury\" and thus easements don't apply. But that's highly subjective.  And as a matter of fact, automobiles ARE a luxury in urban areas. They are not the only viable form of transport. Most urban automobile owners DO have the choice to get off their ass and walk or cycle. Yet the societal consensus is still that everyone just has to put up with their pollution.\n\n**Precedence** and societal consensus. It's likely that the cat population has been around for much longer than you, the house owner. If you buy a house next to a school you have no right to complain about the noise from the play yard. If you buy a house  next to a cat population you have no right to complain about their intrusiveness either. \n\n**[Everycat's right](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_to_roam)**.  A feline version of Everyman's Right. Pretty self explanatory.\n\n**Limited liability**. Many urban cats are strays or adopted strays, where it's debatable whether they are \"owned\" by any individual or the community as a whole. Some cities have a policy of catching strays, in which case this argument doesn't apply. But many cities have a policy of tolerating them, and in those cities the cats have a right to exist just like any other inhabitant.\n\n\n(of course none of the above applies to gated communities and similar which have explicit statutes regarding pets)\n\n\nOooon the other hand, I know that cats can sometimes be a PITA. They kill songbirds and shit in sandboxes. And their population seems to be increasing. \n\nChange my view.\n \n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: The way many universities are treating rape/sexual assault is excessive, alarmist, and bordering on irresponsible. + \n + It's entirely possible that I've been mislead (reddit as a news source can be...fickle...) so if that's the case, then consider me a convert.  But some of the programs that many universities, my own included, are implementing are going to what seems like extremes to prevent rape or sexual assault.  I'll be citing examples from my own experience with just such a program, but unless I'm mistaken (a real possibility) the program I experienced is representative of a larger trend.\n\nAs part of my freshman summer assignment, I had to go through an online module that took about three hours to complete (even at a brisk pace), which I find rather excessive.  It essentially told me that I shouldn't attack (verbally, physically, or otherwise) or harass people or make sexual advances without enthusiastic consent, and told me what to do if I see someone potentially harming or taking advantage of someone else; I agree with the message (mostly) but the fact that I can summarize so completely and concisely a three hour long module is kind of ridiculous.  It also cited a statistic that \"1 in 5 women are sexually assaulted\" which has been shown to be suspect, at best [self-selected sample from 2 universities, hardly statistically rigorous].  If I were a girl who didn't know better, I would seriously be afraid for my life.  I don't mean to downplay the significance of rape or sexual assault, but I find this kind of response to be alarmist and believe it will only cause more violent reactions.  Creating this amount fear tends to create panic, and panic tends to lead to chaos.\n\nThe module gave off the impression that any sort of hesitation should be grounds for immediate cessation of sexual activity; it says that anything short of enthusiastic consent should be taken as a \"no.\"  Are new lovers supposed to never supposed to go beyond that initial insecurity or hesitance?  I find this to be alarmist, and I worry that such a fearful treatment of sex only adds to the taboo that the USA already places around anything sexual.\n\nAlso, one section of the module spoke about rape involving alcohol.  It stated that alcohol removes a person's ability to consent, and thus negates their responsibility to avoid unwanted sex (which I can see, within reason; 1 glass of wine does not a drunkard make [usually]) but that it also does not excuse a person's behavior, and does not render someone innocent of rape.  This seems contradictory.  The module made it seem like a woman is free to drink however much she likes without taking any responsibility (though it did make a note that this was risky behavior), while a man should always be careful because being drunk does not excuse his actions.  I understand that a drunk man forcing sex on a woman is rape, and that a man taking advantage of a drunk woman is rape, but what happens when both are drunk?  By the time I got to this portion, I'd been hammered with all manner of \"don't be a rapist\" and I seriously wonder if both parties being intoxicated would make consensual sex \"okay\" in the eyes of my college.\n\nI'll mention the distinct lack of male victims/female perpetrators - it honestly seemed like the message to men was \"don't rape\" and the message to women was \"watch out for rape\"; even the several fictional examples were of men assaulting women - but I recognize that that's moving into \"oppression olympics\" territory.\n\nThe thing that disturbs me the most is the sinking idea that the kind of people who need this message the most aren't going to listen; those who take this kind of message seriously are already going to avoid assaulting people and be generally kind to one another, while the kind of people who will rape or do other nasty things aren't going to pay much attention.  It obviously isn't going to help the ones who already know their actions are wrong, and I feel like the ones who rationalize their actions, or genuinely believe their actions to be okay, will simply ignore the message as just another \"play nice with others\" ad from school, or worse, an overreaction not meant for them.  I realize how hypocritical that makes me sound, but trust me when I say all of my peers (females included) are also mocking the program for being excessive.  If the program is so lengthy and overdone that many people treat it as a joke, it only gives more credence to those who would dismiss it no matter how long or intense it was.\n\nAs I understand it, my college is far from being an outlier.  If other colleges are doing the same, then they are collectively creating an environment of fear and victimhood for young women, not to mention the demonization of men.  I understand the necessity for knowledge about how to prevent these horrible crimes, but when the rallying cry is \"Not Anymore\" as if these crimes were common or even accepted anywhere in the recent past, I have to question the knowledge and intention of the creators.  It's starting to feel like we've moved beyond crime-prevention and are moving towards McCarthy-esque paranoia.\n\nPlease change my view, it's no fun feeling this way.", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

IS is going to win. + \n + This is part view, part prediction. So it's certainly fallible and i hope to be proven wrong in the near future.\n\nI'd like for IS to be destroyed but i think that's an unrealistic expectation.\n\n[This is a decent look at IS.](http://www.vice.com/vice-news/islamic-state-full-length)\n\nThey are well integrated into the areas they have captured. They are not universally hated by the surrounding civilians. They are not treating all civilians like prisoners or slaves or hostages. They have *plenty* of members, recruits and sympathizers across enormous amounts of land.\n\nMy view is that \"Civilian Blending\" is an unstoppable strategy designed to survive intervention from nations like the U.S.\n\nNo *individual* country that respects, or is bound by, international law can defeat this strategy.\n\n**Civilian Blending:** When a militant or terrorist group embeds into a civilian population in order to protect themselves from formal military retaliation. \n\nWith successful use of this tactic there is minimal distinction, visual or otherwise, between the militants and the civilian people and infrastructure. it's all shared space. militants are often near children and innocent civilians and live within the cities among the people.\n\n**Goal:** To become as indistinguishable as possible from the civilian population to minimize the effectiveness of airstrikes and long range attacks.\n\n**Tactics:** Don't wear uniforms, store weapons in civilian areas such as Mosques, Hospitals, Schools, vital infrastructure, etc. Use residential civilian infrastructure like apartment buildings for militant activity, use mass local propaganda and law enforcement to keep the civilians from fleeing, recruit *willing* civilian martyrs, encourage civilians to hide and assist militants for money, use the inevitable civilian deaths to recruit more militants from the local population, etc.\n\n**Outcome:** Accurate recon becomes incredibly difficult and highly susceptible to errors. High civilian to militant death toll is inevitable in all types of operations. Major mistakes will also happen that result in mass civilian deaths. Extremely high value targets will be impossible to kill without killing innocent people in Mosques, churches, schools, power plants, water treatment plants and other vital infrastructure protected by international laws.\n\n**This will leave the U.S. with very limited options...**\n\n**Option 1:** Contain them. Full victory is impossible without mass civilian deaths and breaking international laws. Let IS have what land they have already taken.

In the army, we did a lot of hard, physical labor in the hot sun, and as a consequence of that, were constantly reminded to drink water and keep hydrated. At the end of the day, we'd all line up to use **one of the two** urinals in the bathroom in our billet. Thinking this was unreasonable, as we had all showered together and seen one another naked anyways, I would cut the line and use the available urinal. Because of this, I was often seen as the \"strange one\" in my platoon. \n\nThe second time I actually had reason to think about the absurdities of male urinal etiquette was working for a University. My department had granted a professorship to the famous author Haruki Murakami, and for whatever reason we happened to run into one another in the restroom at least twice a week for over six months during his appointment. During those six months, I never spoke to him, despite the myriad opportunities I had to strike up conversation with him in the bathroom, simply because of male urinal etiquette. Because of this ridiculous cross-cultural shyness when it comes to the bathroom, I missed out on opportunities to introduce myself to one of my favorite authors! \n\nI want to understand why male urinal etiquette is so strictly adhered to. I feel like the only person on the planet that isn't afraid to strike up a conversation with a fellow man while handling my junk, and I firmly believe that I'm in the right here. As far as I see it, it's caused nothing but awkward misunderstandings and missed social opportunities.

Why does that even bother me?\" And then I asked him, aloud, \"I wonder why people think this is strange?\"*\n\n*Ever since then, I've more or less ignored urinal etiquette.

{"input": "Trash talking in online video games is fine CMV + \n + To begin, I would like to preface my argument with the assertion that my online self does not reflect my personality in real life, and I do not think such aggression would be appropriate in real life. Also, this submission will mainly pertain to the online game League of Legends (henceforth LoL), both because it's what I mostly play and due to the fact that it is a good example of the phenomenon I am about to elaborate upon.\n\nAlso, if you are not familiar with the game please allow me to provide some insight in to the current state of the chat system and player's respective behavior to such. Nearly every game someone (or multiple people) are reported for either verbal abuse or negative attitude, for reasons ranging from saying \"gg\" (good game) slightly before the game ends to people filling chat the entire game with racist accusations in all caps. The community is so report-happy and self-righteous that many simply ignore everyone at the start of the game or hide chat, due to the perceived toxicity of all players or own fear of succumbing to inclinations to chat and being reported thereafter. I'm not happy with this current consensus and feel a dramatic shift of opinion is needed.\n\nFirst, allow me to point out the hypocrisy the LoL community currently exhibits. People love watching other people get trash talked, but get offended when it is directed towards them. I will provide some examples. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYI0Tf7-Vvo), Dyrus (a professional celebrity in the community paid and endorsed by Riot) recently called a majority of the other NA teams non-existent. Here is a [compilation of trash talking excerpts from LoL interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxS76Dk3Rk4). Riot Games (producer of LoL) actively encourages trash talking between teams and players to build up hype (and the community responds positively), but as soon as a player practices similar behavior in a game, he or she can be banned. Should this example not convince you, allow me to point to the player meatwadsprite, commonly known as Dunkey to the community. In a majority of his videos he talks a lot of trash in all chat and he is by far the most popular content producer for the game (and likewise supported by Riot). People find this type of behavior hilarious to watch, but as soon as such harmless commentary is inflicted upon them, the perpetrator deserves some sort of suspension.\n\nHeroes of Newerth (HoN) was (is) a very similar games to LoL. Both were multiplayer battle arenas and were based off the same game (Defense of the Ancients). However, in HoN, players were rarely reported and banned less often than that. The community in that game is what I envision for LoL, where players were unfiltered and free to express themselves. Celebrities in the game such as KingRaven, Daggius, and MoonMeander were most popular, for they were the most entertaining, and players were often coming up with and one-upping their personalities displayed on stream and in videos. These glory days of HoN still bring me nostalgia as the community and my friends alike coordinated in [creating chat macros](http://forums.heroesofnewerth.com/showthread.php?382071-Chat-macro-compilation), ridiculous all chat [messages to disorient the enemy](http://www.dotallyrad.com/2011/10/drd-insult-generator-goes-live-to-help-you-post-big-comments/), while the game developer (S2) created in-game taunts for heroes for purchase [that embarrassed your enemy on successful execution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VC4j4U7K6mc).\n\nI believe these players should get over themselves and embrace the trash talk. It relieves stress, is a fun outlet, and the creativity can often be hilarious. Players seem to prefer a robotic version of the game, where the only allowed chat is as a \"gg\" when the game is over and communicating strategy. A majority of people play the game for two reasons: fun and competition. Both aspects are enhanced through trash talk, as the creativity often produces great laughter while the ladder is augmented by the fact that trash talking raises the stakes of the game, as neither side wishes to lose face.", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: Range Voting is the best electoral system for single-winner elections. + \n + How Range voting (also known as score voting) works:\n\n1. Each vote consists of a numerical score within some range, say 0 to 99 (called Approval voting for 0 to 1) for each candidate. Voters may also indicate \"Abstain\" if they have no opinion about a candidate. Such votes don't affect that candidate's average.\n    \n2. The candidate with the highest average score wins.\n\nHere's why it's better than other systems:\n\nEXPRESSIVE: You give information about all candidates not just one.\n    \nQUANTITATIVE: Your vote not only says that you prefer candidate A over B, but also by how much.\n    \nENCOURAGES HONESTY NOT STRATEGY: Your score for candidate C in no way affects the battle between A vs. B. Hence, you can give your honest opinion of C without fear of \"wasting your vote\" or hurting A. You never have an incentive to betray your favorite candidate by giving a higher score to a candidate you like less. (This may sound like an obvious and easy criterion, but very few other voting systems obey it!) The decreased importance of \"convincing voters you can win\" (as opposed to \"convincing them you are the best\") may decrease the importance of cash.\n    \nUNAFFECTED BY CANDIDATE CLONING: Consider the situation where A has \"clones\" A2 and A3. In the old \"plurality voting\" system, the clones \"split the vote\" and lose. In the \"Borda voting\" system, a party assures victory merely by running enough clones. In contrast, in Range voting, A is neither harmed nor helped \u2013 no more bitter enmity between similar candidates.\n    \nBREAKS STRANGLEHOLD OF 2-PARTY DOMINATION: Plurality &amp; \"Instant Runoff Voting\" yield 2-party domination. \"Approval voting\" improves over those systems by allowing voters to vote for all the candidates that they approve \u2013 with no built-in penalty for approving a third-party candidate. But range voting is even better, since it empirically yields much greater support for 3rd parties than approval voting. Having more parties should also decrease the importance of gerrymandering, and increase interest &amp; turnout.\n    \nCURRENT VOTING MACHINES CAN HANDLE RANGE VOTING: That can't be said of IRV and Condorcet.\n    \nTHE \"BEATS-ALL\" CANDIDATE WINS: A beats-all candidate is one who would beat every other candidate in one-on-one races. Counterintuitively, in many voting systems \"beats all\" candidates do not necessarily prevail. (Indeed, a \"lose to all\" candidate can easily win under our current system.) But in range voting the beats-all candidate always wins.\n    \nFEWER \"SPOILED BALLOTS\": In plurality voting, an overvote can cause your vote to be discarded. With range voting, it causes only part of your vote to get discarded (converted to \"abstain\") with the rest \u2013 your opinions of all the other candidates \u2013 still operational. There's no such thing as an \"overvote\" since expressing opinions about all candidates is the idea; there's no wrong way to fill in a ballot. Range voting also reduces risk of TIES.\n\nLESS FRAUD and BETTER FRAUD DETECTION: Range voting makes fraud more difficult as it isn't as easy as filling out a bunch of ballots for a candidate, as each candidate is to be rated. Selectively destroying ballots is also more difficult as it isn't instantly obvious which ballots benefit a candidate and which don't. It's only in retrospect that one could tell if a 66/99 increased or decreased a candidate's average. Benford's Law would also become a viable method of fraud detection for Range ballots.\n\nNURSERY EFFECT: Candidates/Parties that won't win will get more generous scores as they aren't seen as a threat. This bolsters small parties and gives them the initial boost they need to compete with large parties, but tapers away once the candidates/parties are in a position for success.\n    \nUNBIASED: Plurality and IRV both have natural pro-extremist biases, while Borda has pro-centrist bias. But range-voting has little or no such bias.\n\nDOES THE IMPOSSIBLE: As Range voting is a cardinal not ordinal voting system, [Arrow's impossibility theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem) doesn't apply.\n\n\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

People unfamiliar with the games industry who read these articles are led to believe that a large portion of those opposing these women are psychopath basement dwellers making rape threats. Because this narrative helps their movement so much, I believe that feminists who support the actions of these women can definitely help their movement by creating many fake, anonymous accounts and viciously threatening feminist public figures with them. Drawing from this, while hardcore members of Gamergate have undoubtedly trolled and threatened these women, I believe a decent portion of the vitriol against these women is posted by their supporters.\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

That if the government was smaller, corporations would have less opportunity to abuse subsidies and tax laws, making it easier for new companies to enter the market and out-compete current powers by providing better products or services. I am inclined to believe that wouldn't work; if the market was entirely deregulated, it would be in the best interest of the corporations which are most powerful to form monopolies that make it entirely impossible for the little guy to compete. Furthermore, I wouldn't trust the average consumer to be adequately informed to make choices based on long-term benefits like a healthy body/planet and not simply cost and quality.

{"input": "I believe oligarchy is a bigger and much more urgent problem than patriarchy. CMV + \n + Let us define these concepts first:\n\n**Patriarchy:** From feminist theory, the *a priori* truth that society is immediately geared to favor male *(cis-gendered(?))* people, male-like qualities and male role models to the derision of women, feminine traits and role-models in women and everything else in between. \n\n**Oligrachy:** The *a priori* turth stating society is immediately geared to favor wealth and the wealthy, venerates money and the accumulation of it and puts wealthy people in a pedestal to revered and admired.\n\nColorary:\n\nWhile I have many qualms with contemporary feminism (i.e. it's a movement that preaches gender equality and freedom of expression but acts to tarnish those same principles when met with dissenting opinions), I think some of the ideas it purports have a basis in fact (i.e. the right for a woman to choose over her own body).\n\n\nThat being said, I think the concept of *patriarchy* as the great boogeyman and the reason for all society's ills is misguided, ham-handed and short-sighted. It fails to represent societies around the world in a fair manner over time, assumes men are always favored over women in all circumstances and doesn't acknowledge healthy relationships between a man and a woman exist in many different hues and styles. I also believe the concept destroys history, culture and any kind of context in an effort to view everything with a short-sighted lens.\n\nView:\n\nI think that patriarchy is dwarfed by oligarchy, defined above. Wealth is held by any person at any given point of time, and it is the wealthy who have the power to oppress those who don't have as much wealth. While this is a point counteracted with the argument that most CEOs in the western world are men, this is also short-sighted: It's not hard to see wealth doesn't have a prejudice towards women. Positions of power held by women and men have alike have been based around the accumulation of wealth and social clout. Whenever a woman came from a wealthy family or built her own wealth, power never escaped them because they were female. If we lived in a purely patriarchal society, the smashing success of Oprah Winfrey, Anna Maria Escobedo or Sonia Sotomayor wouldn't be possible. These are all women who built their own wealth, and I'd argue they jumped through as many hoops and obstacles as man in a similar or even identical situation. Looking back on history, wealthy women had a lot more privileges than men and women in lower classes of society. Even though Marie Antoinette's \"Let them eat cake.\" is a fake quote, it speaks to the vision of the French people of their higher classes as privileged people, disenfranchised from their woes. They even went so far as to execute her, not because she was a mother or a woman, but because she represented the crown they hated. \n\nIn my opinion, men aren't favored over women. Society simply favors the wealthy, whoever these people may be. As as society, we allow these people to be beacon and a finish line, a set of desirable traits that sets those who have far above those who haven't. These same people are the ones who get to make our laws (the 2013 US government shutdown), dictate our economy (AIG and the 2008 financial meltdown) and get to decide who thinks what (oligopoly of media). \n\nThe poor man will never be favoured over the rich woman. \n\nI want this view to be challenged.\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "Overpopulation does not exist and any attempts to curb it are immoral and futile. CMV + \n + Overpopulation, by definition, cannot exist. Every species has a carrying capacity. This capacity has many different variables, but essentially it entails access to resources and a sustainable habitat. When this capacity is exceeded, the excess population dies off and the population remains at a sustainable level compared to the amount of resources. A species cannot go \"over\" this capacity. It is literally impossible because of the definition of the word. You cannot have a population greater than the amount of resources that are available to it. Why would humans be any different? Why would we be the only species able to exceed the carrying capacity?\n\nI think the only reason people are terrified is because they see graphs like [this](http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Population_curve.svg/350px-Population_curve.svg.png&amp;imgrefurl=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population&amp;h=207&amp;w=350&amp;sz=6&amp;tbnid=wZ7rAqJKGO-ROM:&amp;tbnh=71&amp;tbnw=120&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__Fia9hekf37zUUn9YszWApu5b_oY=&amp;docid=Rfq_Aji5yK4L7M&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5e7lUdb2CcTuyAGM5YHQCg&amp;ved=0CDQQ9QEwAg&amp;dur=397) and think \"Oh no! Look how much our population has increased in an incredibly short span of time! How will we survive?\" The problem is that, by definition, populations increase exponentially due to the simple mathematical fact that offspring begets offspring. It should be absolutely no surprise that we would go from 1 billion to 2 billion people way faster than from almost no people to 1 billion. It is a fact of nature that populations increase exponentially. We could plot a similar graph from 10,000 B.C. to 1 A.D. and see essentially the same type of graph, just with a smaller total population.\n\nFinally, people in the past have made similar predictions and been way off. Ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle griped about the population being too high. And this was when the population was less than 200 million. Tertullian once said, \"Our numbers are burdensome to the world, which can hardly support us.\" Thomas Malthus thought that the food supply would grow at a stable rate. We see now that he was wrong. Food supply has grown along with demand due to new technologies he could not foresee. Paul Ehrlich wrote in 1968 that millions would die in the next decade. It never came to be. To be fair, others have criticized Malthus, Ehrlich, and others, but that is exactly my point. No one can seem to agree on the amount of the carrying capacity. Estimates range from under a billion (which can now obviously be discredited) to over a trillion. UN estimates range from 7.8 billion on the low end to 12.5 billion on the high end. And this is all assuming no more technological advancements are made. I'm not saying that we should automatically hand-wave any estimate of the carrying capacity. All I'm saying is that there are too many variables to calculate to get an accurate answer. We could easily meet our carrying capacity in the next 50 years, or be just fine for the next 1,000.\n\nNow to the practical and moral aspect. By definition, any attempt to curb the population involves a lower birth rate. But how would we implement such a thing? Most people agree that China's one-child policy is immoral, yet this would be the only way to prevent our population from increasing. In addition, the policy only seems to have affected China's sex balance. Their population is still growing due to the underlying fact that it's incredibly difficult to enforce something like this. In recent years, China seems to have grown more relaxed about the policy. We could educate people about family planning, but this only addresses a symptom rather than a root cause. Ultimately, if a family wants to have six kids, nobody is going to (or can(or, in my opinion, should)) stop them. Other than that, no real solutions have been offered. We hear cries of \"We HAVE to control our population or we will meet dire consequences!\" Yet no solution is ever offered as to how we would achieve such a goal. My opinion is because the only \"solutions\" offered are considered immoral by most people (one-child policy) or impractical (education.) They simply save face in the public eye by crying about how overpopulation is bad, yet never giving any sort of solution. Because there are no solutions. It's next to impossible to artificially control a population outside of war, famine, disaster, or genocide. These are the only \"real\" solutions to \"overpopulation\" and they are both immoral and impractical.\n\nIn my opinion, we should focus more on providing food and water to the malnourished and starving, which is the underlying theme in this whole debate in the first place. Instead of focusing on numbers, we should be focusing on providing for those who can't survive regardless of the amount of people there are. That's the true tragedy here. Western governments moan about the fact that eventually there will be too many people to support their citizen's lifestyles, yet ignore the fact that there are already countries who don't have enough, despite the fact that are currently enough resources to support our planet.", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: I'm uncomfortable with dynamic of (male)Dom/(female)Sub BDSM relationships.

I feel like these types of arrangements play into pre-existing unhealthy male-female power dichotomies, and exaggerating them through sexuality only exacerbates the problem.\n\nIn normal, 'vanilla' heterosexual sex - the male is already dominant. The act of penetration, inserting oneself into another person, is an inherently dominant act. Gender-equal couples can approach this critically and accept that the power dichotomy exists and is unavoidable and take steps to mitigate it. However, in a male-Dom configuration, the male is not only performing his dominant role: he is emphasizing and exaggerating it. Is it the case that the Dom role becomes parodic in its over exaggeration and that the parody is a source of equalizing empowerment?\n\nThe way I see it: female-Dom, male-Sub makes perfect sense. The purpose of non-normative sexuality is to decouple sex from everyday life: to make it a 'sacred space' that is unique (and therefore special) to the couple. A man who is aggressive and dominant in his day-to-day life may feel a great sense of relief from 'laying down his burdens' and being submissive in the bedroom. Likewise, a woman who feels disempowered in broad society can feel empowered in an intimate setting. What doesn't make sense to me is why a woman who is regularly disempowered in her daily life would choose to continue to be disempowered in what should be the safest and most empowering space available.\n\nI'm interested from hearing from people women and men who have or are currently in (male)Dom/(female)Sub relationships. For the men, do you believe in the traditional male/dominant female/submissive gender roles, or are you somehow subverting them? For the women, do you feel that your Sub role is challenging society's expectation of your gender, or do you feel empowered by embracing what you see as your role in the male/female dichotomy?\n\nAgain, I'm not passing (or even withholding) judgement of anyone's sexual preferences. I legitimately don't understand, because I've never had anyone explain it to me. In my sexual relationship, our sexual practices are as equal as I imagine is possible, so a power-dynamic sexual relationship is alien to me.

And I love a great conspiracy theory as much as the next guy but this whole Bundy Ranch thing is getting convoluted. Basically, from what I've gathered, this guys' family has had this ranch for generations and used the land adjacent to their ranch (which they do not own) as grazing ground for their cattle. That was all fine until public property laws started popping up. The state started making his family pay grazing fees for their cattle grazing on land they didn't technically own. They were ok with this. It was controlled by the local government at that time. Then came about the federal establishment, Bureau of Land Management. Now how they were given justification, if at all, over this public property that Bundy's cattle graze on I have no idea. But apparently it wasn't an issue at first because Bundy had started making his annual grazing fees to them without issue. Then apparently around 20 years ago he had an issue with BLM that I'm unclear on other than he said they were \"managing him out of business\" and decided to stop paying grazing fees. He says he's made attempts to pay the state of Nevada the grazing fees but they refuse to take it, which makes sense if it's a federally controlled thing now. So for ~20 years they let him continue to use land that wasn't his without paying his grazing fees. So now I know about the endangered tortoise ploy as well as the Chinese energy company solar panel field conspiracy and Sen. Reid and his son's involvement. There may be some ulterior motive, I'm not saying there isn't, involved in this land deal for the solar panels but there have been at least one report that the projected area for the solar panel field doesn't even come into either the Bundy Ranch nor the contested land this whole dispute is about: http://polizeros.com/2014/04/12/harry-reid-son-plan-solar-power-near-bundy-ranch/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+PoliticsInTheZeros+(Politics+in+the+Zeros).\n\nAnd the tortoise thing?

There are two main reasons:\n\n1) Streaming and subscription services have exploded at a staggering rate. Look at Spotify and Netflix as the prime examples. For an incredibly cheap price, or sometimes at no price at all, you can listen to almost any song your heart desires, or watch any movie that strikes your interest. Yes, it is true that both of these services do not have literally everything, but as the years go on, these services will only get better, to the point where it is virtually impossible to not have access to a movie or song.\n\n2) Storage devices will only continue to increase in storage capacity. Why own a disc that takes up physical space in your household when you can download all of your TV shows, movies, and music onto your computer? Many people today are creating their own home servers with tons of storage space to hold all their media. Granted, this is a bit difficult for those who are not tech savvy, but a few years from now, I'm positive that obtaining a server for your media and being able to place media on it will become an incredibly simple process.\n\nAs one final, less important point, physical media is restricted in its quality. What you purchase is what you get. For example, DVDs are not capable of playing movies in full HD. In order to get the best quality, you need to repurchase your DVDs in blu-ray.

{"input": "I believe that everyone is selfish and there is no true kindness in people. CMV + \n + This could be stemmed from my poor social experiences or from what i learnt in my psychology diploma, and soon recently came to the conclusion that there is no true kindness/altruism whatever you call it. \n\nFor a behavior to happen, there needs to be some sort of motivation. Intrinsic or extrinsic, there is a need for people to behave a certain way. Extrinsic motivation is plain and simple. The most common is money. People work for money, people steal for money, people who do charity gain acceptance of society, which in turn lets them earn more from their enterprises since the company they represent is more accepted. That's what i believe. \n\nEven if there is an intrinsic motivation, the person definitely have to do it for his or her own cause. For example, a generous person who makes self-sacrifices for others could gain satisfaction in his own mind that he's done something \"good\" and the social acceptance which he gets would motivate him to do more kind deeds, since society as a whole promotes pro-social behaviors. \n\nOr someone sees an injustice and steps in for the victim. The person seeing the injustice could just be annoyed at the situation and in order to resolve the annoyance he steps in to help the weak. I would also think that that's just a method for the person to deal with some internal unsolved issues to make himself/herself feel better. For example, a man who was a bully victim steps in to fight off some bullies because he did not have the courage to stand up to them when he was younger. Because of that, he may feel a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction in himself. Thus, since there is a personal gain, I do not see pure kindness. \n\nSo basically even when someone does something good or kind, i would attribute it to his or her need to be socially accepted or the self-satisfaction, and when there's personal gain from displaying pro-social behaviors, I do not believe that people can have pure kindness. But hey, that's just my opinion man.\n\n\n\nNo matter how I looked at things, I can always attribute acts if kindness with some form of personal gains. \n\nI may not have phrased it correctly saying that everyone is selfish.

Nevertheless I still love driving. Part of the reason is because of how inefficient our public transit system is one could still get around the city in the same amount of time as it would to drive, even in rush-hour traffic. Sure parking might be an expensive inconvenience from time to time, but I like many people drive not just as a mode of transportation, but because its actually an enjoyable activity for me.\n\nI understand that self-driving cars *could* eliminate gridlock and save \"countless\" lives by removing the human error that comes with driving (I emphasize the could because from what I know there aren't any actual statistics or studies that I am aware of that can support this). That said, I think people forget that even extremely simple technology does fail from time to time. If anything were to go wrong in a self-driving car, how would someone be able to intervene? I mean if we were introduced to self-driving cars tomorrow, I wouldn't be as concerned because most people would know how to control the vehicle. But if years from now, when people have become accustomed to self-driving cars, would they know how to control the car if the self-driving mechanism fail, or would it be just a matter of placing complete faith in a computer technology created by the same humans who's error we're trying to avoid?\n\nI personally think it would also take what enjoyment there is in driving away from the experience. As mentioned, if I wanted a mode of transportation where I didn't have to do anything (at all) I would just take public transit. I enjoy driving because I can control both my speed and my route (if I want to go out of my way to take a more scenic route home, I have the option), all in the comfort of a private vehicle with my own music playing and my own company. Although a self-driving car wouldn't affect the latter, the former (which is the reason why I drive rather than ask others for rides) would be compromised. \n\nThere's an entire culture and community around driving that revolves around making improvements to what you drive and I can't help but feel that'd completely disappear with self-driving cars. I wouldn't be opposed to people buying self-driving cars if that's truly what they want (no different that people who chose to buy cars with automatic transmissions) or even if there were the option to turn on a self-driving mode (which I'll admit would be nice in bumper-to-bumper traffic where you're really not even driving anyways), but my view is exactly that to have the **option**.

Many people come to the conclusion that these type of insults are homophobic and misogynistic, but I don't believe that's necessarily the case at all.\n\nI think the most insulting thing about being called a girl for a boy is the affront to his own identity.

They tend to want to be smaller than their partners because they feel masculine if they are taller. They religiously pluck facial hair and shave away body hair because that's manly. But they probably don't hate men.\n\nSimilarly, being called gay is a huge insult to many guys not because they are all homophobic, but because they are being called something they are not.\n\nI think the best way to see it from my point of view is looking at how offensive it is for trans people when they are mis-gendered (Purposely).

However, at face value, I think \"deserving\" is an invalid concept, and actions should be carried out to the maximum total benefit, rather than to shift benefit to those who should have it. I also see the entire purpose of law itself to be to steer society towards good, and therefore it is morally good to do things that will make people want to be on the right side of the law, but the end of benefiting good people more than bad is a means to the end of shifting those bad people to good more than it is an end in and of itself.\n\nNot only do I believe that this is the *correct* moral philosophy, I believe that any system of morality which rejects the core utilitarian belief that maximum total happiness (utility) is the only valid end is inherently evil and misguided, and should be eliminated. The argument that people have the right to certain views or such don't make sense to me, because a utilitarian world is better than a non-utilitarian one.\n\nIn a realistic, day-to-day sense, I behave like any one of you. I speak up for equal rights, I won't do anything drastic, and I simply attempt to reciprocate kindness and consider that \"enough.\" However, the core arche that lays in the centre of all of my thought is and always has been that my actions are ideally to the end of maximum happiness for the most involved parties. This does not mean I attempt to shift my thought patterns to that of an Archangel (R. M. Hare's concept of a being who knows every outcome of every action and can act to create maximum utility), but rather that when I try to \"do the right thing,\" or construct, ponder, or debate my philosophical and political beliefs, it is always in the consideration of what will create the most total utility.\n\nI've already read up on all the criticisms, and I see most \"undesirable\" outcomes as positive (a utility monster would be supremely happy and create no suffering, murder is acceptable to stop a trolley, the mona lisa is more valuable than the old lady in the fire, etc). What I ask is for you to show me ways that other systems of belief are not totally evil and in some way bigoted, in that they detract from total happiness to some personal or hopelessly selfless end.\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: Five-star-ism is converting all ratings to binaries and is making the world worse. + \n + I made this comment on /r/flipping but I want to discuss it further, because it's something that I genuinely think is a social problem, however I'd like to be reassured otherwise.\n\neBay are cancelling the accounts of sellers who get more than around 8% of less than five star ratings. By doing this, eBay are trying to force sellers to satisfy 100% of buyers. Because there is some irreducible percentage of buyers who are unreasonable, this is never going to actually work. Getting an unreasonable buyer is random, and accordingly there will be sellers who get pushed out due to nothing more than the bad luck of getting several unreasonable buyers in a row. No matter how good you are, your eBay account now has a half-life.\n\nThis is a consequence of an American cultural malaise, \"five-star-ism\", the drive towards unreasonable standards of perfection, and the perfect is the enemy of the good. A pass is a good mark. Three star service is actually good service. Three stars means that it wasn't noticably great or noticably terrible; you just got exactly what you wanted. Every transaction that you did today, that you didn't even notice, what you got there was three star service. You deserve three star service. What makes better service better, is that you didn't actually deserve it.\n\nIn a sane world, if you get better than acceptable service, that's four stars. If you get the best service you've ever seen, that's five. If you were disappointed in some way which is clearly attributable to the service provider, but you still got more-or-less what you wanted, that's two stars. If they were completely incompetent and absolutely failed you, that's one star. (Or zero, if they intentionally angered you.)\n\nHowever, those who decide these things in eBay, Uber, Walmart, Blizzard, various American call centres, etc etc have all somehow come to the bizarre decision that \"acceptable\" should mean five stars, and anything less than five stars, is unacceptable. I took an Uber ride the other day. I rated the guy five stars, for no other reason than that I knew that if I did not, he would be punished. He had done nothing wrong. He did exactly what I expected of him. No more, no less. He deserved three stars. I wanted to be able to give him that rating without any concern for his continued employment (well, his contract).\n\nThis state of affairs completely grinds my gears. It destroys the very purpose of having rating systems at all. It converts the rating system back to a binary, \"bad/good\", with no meaningful distinction between those ratings. Worse, it makes no actual provision for recognition of genuinely good service. If you rate any seller who sent the thing out in acceptable condition within acceptable time as \"five star\" - how do you fairly rate the one who sent it out quicker than you expected, better packed, and the item in better condition than you were told? How do you rate the Uber driver who showed up early, got you to your destination quickly, and had a great conversation with you?\n\nAm I wrong?

As their influence becomes more pervasive throughout the world, who will stand to stop it when it manifests itself as an actual attack?  \n\nThe Middle East needs America.\n\nThis one sounds ridiculous, but far from it.  I will not argue that America Iraq and Afghanistan; however, I will argue that America sending a signal to the rest of the Middle East that they are no longer interested in getting involved will cause more loss of life than if America intervenes.  Iran can be seen as the biggest threat to peace and stability in the Middle East.  If Iran thought that they could act with impunity then we could see Israel wiped off the map, as well as any other groups that Iran does not get along with, because they would, in effect, become a regional power.  This leads to my final point.\n\nIf America were to withdraw from the world and stop being the, \"police\" of the world, we would instead see a rise of regional powers to fill the power vacuum that would emerge.  It's not too hard to see who those would be: In the Middle East, Iran.  In Asia, China.  The European Union would continue on, though Russia would more than likely be a huge agitator.  Brazil would more than likely become the South American regional power.  Two of those powers listed are terrible options, and the chances that all four of them (five if you count the USA) armed would not lead to a devastating war are slim.  The United States of America must continue its role as police of the world, because the world needs the United States more than the United States needs the world.

{"input": "CMV: VR is a fad that will suffer the same fate it did in the 90's + \n + This is in relation to the mass consumer market (i.e. some niche markets in VR might be here to stay).  Here are the reasons.  Quote or name the item you wish to refute.\n\n1. **Big, bulky, expensive, complicated, and confines you to a fixed space.**  The trend in technology is going the opposite direction: Things that are highly portable, over-simplified and light.  Less complexity, not more, has been the winning strategy.\n\n2. **Difficult to adopt**  Good luck getting grandma and grandpa buying these things, connecting them to a kick-ass expensive computer, and using them at home.  The idea of having grandparents tele-presence into your kids birthday party sounds great, but highly impractical.\n\n3. **Inferior to just using Skype/Facetime/Etc, for interacting with family, friends, and business**  Instead of getting my parents to buy these things along with computers and everything else they need, simply Skyping from their phones not only is quick and easy, but I can also see them and we can communicate in a very human level.  I'm not looking at a tele-presenced robot or orb, I'm looking right at their faces and taking part of all the non-verbal communication that goes along with that.  The tele-presence Skype tablet RC devices are fine - I can see and interact with the people at the other end, and they can see and interact with me.  VR, however, doesn't work.  Even on a virtual business meeting, I don't want to see ridiculous avatars of my partners, I want to see them and communicate effectively.\n\n4. **Not compelling for events such as concerts**  Tele-presence in concerts or special events will not be compelling.  Being at the event is about interacting with everyone around you.  Taking that away, and it's just a crappy app were you can't really see the event clearly nor hear/feel the music the way you can live.  If audio technology that can recreate a live environment becomes commercially available, I rather watch the event on youtube that way. since taking human interaction away, all that's left is enjoying the raw performance.  On a professional recording I get a better view of the stage, better audio, less noise from the crowd, etc.\n\n5.  **Control issues**  A controller that would be great for a FPS video game, is not the same as one for tele-presence, nor the same for playing virtual golf, etc, etc.  There's no clear path to a breakthrough in this area.  It might take 30 years, it might not happen.  For now we are left with it being a sitting experience with some crappy controllers.  Basically glorified 3D glasses, which themselves didn't revolutionize the industry.\n\n6. **Novelty wears off for games**  Play *Fallout3* or *Team Fortress* and it's pretty awesome for the first 10 minutes, but after that, you just want to play the damned game.  Same thing happened with the 3DS.  After 10 minutes, all the 3D would do is get in the way of the experience.  You play a game to play a game, not to look around like a dumbass.  At the end of the day, being able to jump in and out of a video game quickly and easily wins over my desire to stand there looking around like a dumbass.\n\n7. **OK for tele-presenced travel** The one area it might be cool is virtual travelling where I can stand live on a street in Paris, for instance.  However, moving would be very difficult or not done, so limited as well.  I can have a friend in Paris wear a helmet with a VR camera so I can experience what he/she experiences, but it would be quite awkward for him/her, and I'd have no control over what happens.\n\nAs far as I can see, any improvements to fix these problems are either 20-30 years in the future, or might not happen.\n\nNOTE: I don't count AR in this.  AR is a clear win.  Being to see info on anything you see in real life is huge.  For example, looking at someone's car, and being able to see make,model,price,dealers is a win.  Human hunger for raw information is clear.  Another example, is seeing all the words in my environment in my native language (For example, go to China and see English instead of Chinese when you look at any writing in signs, stores, museums, etc).  Maybe even hear English when others speak foreign languages one day.  Look at a star and see it's name and constellation.  Look at a virtual TV in my living room that I can make bigger or smaller at will.  Many many awesome things will be possible with AR.\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

There is no \"thrill of the hunt\" in shooting a lion from several meters in an armored jeep. If a human wants to hunt for sport, there should be a real chance of failure or injury in taking trophies. Neanderthals did not have throwing spears, only thrusting spears. This meant that they had to get very close to their quarry when hunting. As you can imagine, they were frequently trampled and gored by large animals.

So CMV please!\n\nNow I understand that many of these views are simply cultural and are not inherent human traits, but I would like to frame these points in the realm of modern western culture.\n\nI think females have higher value in western society because: \n\n- Men must pay up at parties, bars, and other social settings while women get in cheap or free. Women are simply more desirable to have at social settings than men are.\n\n- The sex industry serves men. In a capitalist society, this translates to women being a scarcity and in demand. Excuse the crudeness, but there is the saying \"pussy costs money, but dick is free.\"\n\n- There are 105 men for every 100 women born. In the most active and productive years of their lives, men outnumber women, thus adding to the value of being female.\n\n- Women are given a substantial amount of attention in certain communities, like Reddit and tech-related interests. Because of this, women interested in sports, gaming, science, or other male-dominated areas are special and desirable. I cannot think of equivalent communities where men are as \"in demand\" and desirable. \n\n- There are three times as many Male-to-Female trans operations than there are Female-to-Male [questionable statistic]. I see this as women being the more desirable gender.\n\n- Women definitively represent sexually desire, even to other women. The amount of bi-sexual women strongly outnumbers the amount of bi-sexual men [anecdotal observation]. A woman's body is considered sexy and beautiful; a man's is not.\n\n- The image of a woman is more valuable than one of a man. For example, Reddit posts with attractive women in them become much more popular than they would be otherwise. \n\n- The old saying \"women and children first\" reinforces the value of females over males. Society prefers that women live over men. We would rather send our men to war and have men do dangerous jobs.\n\n- Female crime victims get more media attention than male ones. \n\n- Similarly, female social issues get more media attention. Feminism, breast cancer, glass ceiling, etc. Male issues do not get this much attention.\n\n- Simply that men are seen as the \"default\" human being implies that women are special.\n\n- For a man to gain value, he must prove himself. Women have more value by default due to their scarcity and sexual desirability.\n\nI feel that there is something very wrong with thinking this way, but no matter how much I've tried to convince myself otherwise, I can't see past it.

{"input": "CMV: Being \"door-prized\" is the fault of the cyclist, and cyclists should ride out of the range of doors. + \n + Before I start, I don't believe the above in all cases. Here are my two exceptions where I feel it is the fault of the door-opener:\n\n1. When the driver or passengers leave the vehicle when it is not in a proper parking spot. This is an illegal time to open the door anyway. I've seen videos taken in New York of Taxi passengers being like \"this is the best spot to get out, even though my Taxi is still in the middle of the road\", and then BAM. Door prize. This is the passenger's fault.\n\n2. When the driver opens the door into a **marked** bike lane (without ensuring it is safe to do so). Note: if the bike lane is positioned correctly, it should never be within the door range of a parked car anyway, so this situation *should* never exist, but in reality it sometimes does exist. In the situations where it does exist, I think that since the driver had to safely cross a **marked** bike lane to park their car, it should be incredibly obvious that they need to be careful when opening their door on the way out. That's why in this situation I think it's the fault of the door-opener.\n\nNow on to my arguement. First off, I do cycle on the road in a decent size city from time to time (I used to do it full time), so I am sympathetic to the plights of cyclists. I'm not just an ignorant driver yelling from my spot of comfort.\n\n(When I do ride, I feel like I ride in a very safe, patient, predictable fashion. For example, I don't pass by cars stopped at intersections because I don't feel that it is reasonable for them to be expected to see me. I'll sit directly behind them in line with their license plate, and I'll let them do what they are doing without me making an erratic, sudden, unexpected pass. If I can't get directly behind them, I'll still let them turn right or left or whatever without darting in front of them or near them. Cars have many blind spots and motorists can't be reasonably expected to check all of them all the time as well as monitor what's in front of them *while* making a turn. Not even the best, most-attentive driver in the world could do so. Therefore, I ride the way I do not only to keep myself safe, but to make life easier and less stressful on motorists. We're all in this together.)\n\nDoor-prizing is probably the best example of cyclists having an attitude like \"People have to watch out for me in *blank* situation! I'm not at all going to help them not make a mistake in *blank* situation just because I'm not legally required to do so even though I could make the same mistake if I was them.\". I understand how in the law it is written that a motorist must always open their door only when it is safe to do so. However, I do not agree with this law as I do not feel that is it reasonable to blame a driver for opening his or her door into the path of a cyclist. Here's why:\n\n1. Even the best, most attentive driver can miss a cyclist that is riding close enough to be door-prized. You can shoulder check, mirror check, or whatever. If a cyclist is within only a few feet of that side of your car and coming fast, then they can be difficult to see until it's too late. This is especially true if they are riding parallel with your driver side tires when you are making your checks and then they suddenly turn out to go around you when you go to open the door.\n\n2. Pedestrians are expected to cross at crosswalks. Why?  Because a driver can't be expected to monitor for pedestrians that are crossing at every part of the road from every direction, so we put the crosswalks at certain parts of the roads so that the drivers know where to expect pedestrians. Similarly, it's just as reasonable to say, \"cyclists, it is illegal for you to ride in the range of the doors because it's not reasonable for drivers to expect you to be on simply any part of the road you want. You have to be where they expect traffic. They don't expect traffic right next to them when they are parked.\"\n\n3. The cyclist, for their own safety, should not be riding in range of the doors. They are doing something incredibly dangerous by riding in the door range of parked cars. If someone is doing something incredibly dangerous, and someone hurts them as a result, then often the person who hurts them should not be held at fault. I feel this is one of those situations.\n\n4. Door-prizing a cyclist is a mistake anyone can easily make, and it's **much** easier to teach the cyclist not to ride in the door-prize lane than it is to teach the driver to ensure that every single time they open their door they need to spend the 2 to 3 seconds to do their best to make sure no cyclist is about to dangerously pass them (even if the driver is preoccupied, in a rush, distracted by a child wanting to get out of the car, etc.). Keep in mind you're not just teaching drivers, you'd have to teach children too because anyone can be opening one of the doors on that side of the car. Also, I think you'd be dishonest with me if you say that every single time you open your car door you are 100% aware of what's next to you. You're lucky that there was never an irresponsible cyclist those times that you did.\n\n\nFinally a cyclist might argue \"sometimes I need to cycle in the 'door-prize lane' because there's not enough room for cars to pass me if I ride further to the left\". In that situation you should simply \"take the lane\", which means that you ride in the centre of the lane so cars cannot pass you. This is 100% legal; you are still riding as far to the right as is safe to do so. If there are cars parked along the side of the road, then the traffic on that road is likely slow enough that you will have little trouble \"taking the lane\". If cars need to pass and you'd prefer to not have them sit behind you, you can move over into the \"door-prize lane\" and **stop** and wait until it's reasonable to move into the regular traffic lane again.\n\n\n\n\n\n* The hazard of riding near parked cars is incredibly obvious to the cyclist but the hazard of opening the car door is not so obvious to the door-opener because of human nature and what we are taught.\n\n* The cyclist has more control over where he/she rides than we have control over our occasional forgetfulness (or ignorance), especially while doing something as innocent to our brain as opening a door, no matter how hard we try or how responsible and cautious of a person we are.\n\n* The cyclist is **knowingly and deliberately** doing something that is well-understood to be quite dangerous when there are alternatives (even if you are forced into the \"door-lane\", you can always ride slowly there or even come to a stop if that's what it takes to ride safely), while the door-opener is **unknowingly and accidentally** doing something dangerously that 99.99% of the time is safe and harmless.\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

Can everyone please add a comment to any of my posts that you feel should include a Delta for the comment I am responding to?\n\n*****\n\n\n\nThis may be the most compelling counter-argument I have seen so far, but I still have problems with it. I grant that arguing from \"no reason\" leads to a conclusion that cannot be disproven through reason, but I don't think I can grant that most topics fall under this description. Even a belief in God rests on reasons, though they be illogical reasons, and these reasons can be challenged through examination. \n\nThis is actually getting to the core of a problem with which I am currently struggling. If we begin from the assumption that one should not believe anything without first having good reason to believe (as I agree we should) we are left with nothing to believe in as absolutely nothing can be conclusively proven. At the base of everything is our subjective personal experiences and we have no way to know we are not a \"brains in a jar,\" in a \"simulation,\" or just a \"butterfly dreaming\" we are a man.\n\nThe final inescapable conclusion is that we know nothing and can prove nothing, yet it seems that we exist (\"I think therefore I am\") and that our (supposedly free-willed) choices alter our experience of \"reality.\" So, I have come to the conclusion that we have no real alternative but to act \"as if\" reality is what it appears to be so far as we can tell.\n\nStarting from that belief, we are able then to begin describing \"reality\" and ascribing value to choices and actions based on consequences if nothing else. We strive to define what is \"good\" and in so doing it is necessary to compare our experience with others and solicit feedback. The best method of mutual inquiry is not to start by saying we know nothing (a dead end if true), but to make a claim to what we think we do know from our own experience: to make a truth-claim about reality. Someone has got to stick their neck out, make a declaration, and defend their reasons under scrutiny.\n\nIt is then the job of the other participant to reveal flaws in this original claim. To arrive at the best possible truth, it is necessary for the opposing sides to support their claims to the best of their ability. If the one who makes the initial claim yields to a bad argument (specifically bad logic), then the process of seeking truth has been derailed, just as if the opponant yields to the original claim without making good challenges. \n\nNone of this means to suggest that a person should be unwilling to change their position if good reason exists to do so, only that such good reason should be based on \"firm and unshakable logic\" rather than flimsy and unstable illogical argument.\n\nDoes this clarify my perspective?

{"input": "CMV:I don\u2019t think the US is actually more religious than Europe + \n + **Central claim**: While various polls show that Americans *claim* they are religious at a higher rate than Europeans do, I argue that the actual impact that religion has on peoples\u2019 lives is actually greater in Europe. \n\n**Point 1:** The US is the only country in the world that explicitly prohibits the government from backing a church. By contrast, the following European countries have officially established state religions and/or force their citizens to pay taxes to a church and/or give them explicit constitutional privileges:\n\n[source 1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_religion)\n[source 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_tax)\n\nArmenia,\nAustria,\nCroatia,\nDenmark,\nEngland,\nFinland,\nGeorgia,\nGermany,\nGreece,\nIceland,\nItaly,\nLiechtenstein,\nLuxembourg,\nMalta,\nMonaco,\nNorway,\nPoland,\nSpain,\nSweden,\nSwitzerland,\nVatican City\n\n\n**Point 2**: US Church attendance numbers are probably inflated. Around 43% of people in the US claim to attend church weekly, but [studies like this one from Columbia University]( http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/stuff_for_blog/church4.pdf) conclude that the real number is actually more like 25%. *EDIT: Based on the numbers [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_attendance#Weekly_statistics), the European countries listed report weekly attendance of roughly 22% (after adjusting for population).*\n\n**Point 3**: While a large portion of American citizens *say*, for instance, that they don\u2019t believe in evolution, their behavior implicitly contradicts that view every time they go to the doctor.\n\n**Point 4**: There is a significant amount of religious violence in Europe, and very little in the US. The conflict in Northern Ireland between Protestants and Catholics (which admittedly has a significant political dimension as well) has resulted in thousands of deaths and tens of thousands of injuries over the past 50 years. Islamic violence should also be considered here, which is much more frequent in Europe, but this gets pretty difficult when trying to separate which incidents were done *because of* Islam, and which were simply done *by* Muslims, but for unrelated reasons.\n\n**Point 5**: Islam is on the rise in Europe. The Muslim population in Europe currently represents about 6% overall (compare with 0.8% in the US), and the fervor of their religious practice is well beyond anything we see in other religious groups. ~~Some projections estimate that Europe will be 25% Muslim by 2030 while others say it won\u2019t reach that level until as late as 2100,~~Edit: Misread sources. One said \"*by* 25% by 2030\" while the other said \"to 25% by 2100\". but there is general agreement that it will constitute an increasingly influential political force over the coming years. \n\n**Point 6**: Various European countries have hate speech laws that may be well-intentioned, but in practice are frequently used to prevent people from speaking ill of Islam. By contrast, criticizing religion in the US is perfectly legal, and the Supreme Court\u2019s track record on protecting free speech suggests strongly that this isn\u2019t going to change any time soon.\n\n**Point 7**: Tension between Muslims and the rest of the population is on the rise in Europe. Some groups are actively, openly pushing to impose Sharia Law in the UK ([relevant video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC2VQjSgpso)). Statistics on how widespread this tension is are hard to come by, in part due to the chilling effects of the aforementioned hate speech laws. \n\n**Point 8**: In terms of impact, religion in the US plays a notable role in political debates surrounding abortion, some elements of science education, and biotech/genetic engineering. But the biggest anti-abortion protest ever held in the US (that I can find) had only about 650,000 people (2013 in DC), while a 2009 anti-abortion rally in Spain drew about 1.2 million. As far as science education goes, people who advocate for creationism in the US have been basically totally unsuccessful in getting creationism into classrooms, so I would argue that that constitutes near-zero impact. Progress of biotech research in both the US and Europe is somewhat stifled by cumbersome regulations, but the overwhelming bulk of that was in place before biotech became a mainstream issue, for reasons that had nothing to do with religion. Admittedly though, I don\u2019t know that much about biotech policy in Europe, so please let me know if you have a different take.\n\nSo that's about it. Let me know what you think.

These threads generally include a story or two about a guy that decided to show up to work in a skirt and was made fun of, or sent home to change.\n\nI think that having a \"Dress Up for Work\" day would help move the needle on this issue.  Having a day where a large number of men go to work in skirts or dresses would have a number of advantages, I think.  First, it wouldn't just be one individual who feels isolated in his workplace.  Even if a particular guy is the only one doing it in his office, he'll know that other guys in other offices are doing it, too.  Second, having it be a specific day will allow men to talk to their bosses about it ahead of time, and might generate some media that will help alert people in general.  I think just showing up suddenly in a completely different mode of dress is what causes some of the disruption that makes managers crack down on men wearing skirts.  Being prepared for it would help make it more of a regular day at the office.  If I wanted to start wearing a headscarf to work, I would probably tell people ahead of time, so that it's not a big deal when I do start dressing in a completely different way.  Finally, it would allow men the time to review their company's dress code and plan for the day.  I imagine it would take more shopping for the average guy who has never worn a skirt to find one that suits him.  Having a movement instead of just doing it on their own would allow guys to give each other feedback on what they have found that works, or maybe even create garments that are more flattering for the male anatomy.  This would also lead to more acceptance because a piece of clothing that fits well and is flattering to the wearer's body type is less noticeable than ill-fitting and unflattering clothing.\n\nOver all, I think that enough men want to be able to wear skirts that it would have momentum, and showing that there are a large number of people who support the idea would increase the pace at which it is generally accepted.\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

It seems that the themes and tenets of Christianity are far superior. Christianity is simply an improvement to Judaism, which focuses on the arbitrary rules of an overtly vengeful and hateful God, as outlined in Leviticus. Though I understand the Old Testament is part of Christianity, in the New Testament, Jesus dismisses the often ridiculous, hateful, and discriminatory rules of the OT. For example when a Pharisee asks Jesus if they should stone an adulterer (as Deuteronomy would demand), he says, \"He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.\" Jesus replaces these archaic rules with the idea that love, forgiveness, leading a good life, etc are what is important. He says this throughout many parables, for example \"A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you.\" Furthermore, Islam does not seem to contain these positive tenets, but instead promotes discrimination, sexism, and violence. While Christianity would tell you that you should love everyone and treat them well, e.g. in regards to serving god and going to heaven, Jesus says thanks the righteous for \"whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me,\" Judaism would tell you to stone sinners, and Islam to kill infidels.

The reality is \"staying home with my kids is just not important enough to us for us to be willing to change our current lifestyle.\" + \n + Before I get into my argument, here are my caveats:\n\n* I fully believe that *some* moms truly truly cannot afford to stay home and must go back to work, but I believe this is a small percentage of the moms who say things like, \"I really wish I could stay home, but we just cannot afford it.\" Specifically, single moms are, of course, amazing. Most of the moms I am challenging with this post are in two-adult households.\n* I am *not* saying that all moms should stay home with their children. If a mom justifies going back to work because she doesn't really enjoy staying home, great! Go back to work, and know that you are being totally honest with the world and yourself. If you have any other reason for going back to work, other than some version of \"we can't afford for me stay home,\" great! Have a great career! You are not to whom this post is addressed.\n* I know that I am being terribly gender exclusive with my language. I fully support dads that want to stay home. In reality, though, I have never met one. Every person I have heard give the \"can't afford to stay home\" line was a woman. In reality, though, my argument would be just as valid if a couple considered the dad staying home but concluded that \"we just can't afford for him to stay home.\"\n* I personally see value in a mom staying home until all the kids are in school. To me, I do not see much value for the family in her staying home after that. **BUT THIS IS TOTALLY MY OPINION AND IS IRRELEVANT TO MY ARGUMENT.** I don't really care if you think moms and/or dads should stay home or not. I only care about why they believe they are not staying home.\n\nHere is the core of my argument. **Many women convince themselves that they really want to stay home with the kids but that their current financial realities, over which they have no real control, will not allow them to do so. **Essentially, they are convincing themselves that powers outside of their control are dictating that they must go back to work.\n\nI believe that, for most families who use this line, this is nonsense. There are usually options: moving to a smaller house/apartment or a cheaper town, cutting expenses (going out to eat less, cheaper vacations, consigned clothes, cord-cutting, etc.). Due to all kinds of cultural pressures, of which so many of us are largely unaware,  many families legitimately feel like they cannot go without cable TV, cook dinner for themselves each night, go on cheaper vacations, etc.\n\nI know that this post sounds incredibly judgmental. To be transparent (if you couldn't guess already), my wife is a stay-at-home-mom (SAHM) with our 11 month son. She worked in a great career until our son was born.

{"input": "CMV: The US relies too much on qualifications rather than capabilities, to its economic, social, and moral detriment + \n + So, in order to get a job as X, oftentimes you need a degree in X specifically.  This is an absurd system.\n\nThe old rationale for having a degree as a prerequisite for being able to do a job well was that that person has acquired some specialized knowledge that isn't available to other people.  This rationale has been significantly eroded by the advent of the Internet.  \n\nAnd even if someone does have specialized knowledge, why would we want to reward the people who hoard knowledge instead of sharing?  Because if they aren't sharing knowledge, then they aren't looking out for the best interests of the nation/community anyway, so they have no business being in a position of privilege/power.\n\nFrom a 2010 Time [article](http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1967580,00.html):\n\n\"It is absurd that people have to get college degrees to be considered for good jobs in hotel management or accounting \u2014 or journalism. It is inefficient, both because it wastes a lot of money and because it locks people who would have done good work out of some jobs. The tight connection between college degrees and economic success may be a nearly unquestioned part of our social order. Future generations may look back and shudder at the cruelty of it.\"\n\nBecause people need specific degrees in order to get good jobs, everyone is locked into educational arms races against one another.  \n\nSo before, a high school degree was enough to get you a job that paid a livable wage, then it was a bachelor's, and now it's a master's or professional degree.\n\nConsider the possibility that in the digital age, formal education has little or no value added in terms of capability and is really just a signalling mechanism for intelligence or drive or money at a particular time in a person's life.  \n\nAnd consider that that is a tremendous waste of human life and potential, because instead of competing against one another for educational credentials, \"students\" could be living, working in, and serving society with education as a byproduct of that.  \n\nInstead of divorcing \"education\" and \"life,\" we should treat young people and non-degreed people as full members of the nation/community who would be capable of doing what people with degrees can do if they were allowed.  Education should be a natural part of living, and not something that takes place only in some industrialized factory schools.\n\nWith that view, I think we might start looking after students and paying them to go to school like in other countries, instead of having them take out ridiculous non-dischargeable student loans just because they want to educate themselves.\n\nThe only criterion for whether a person should be allowed to do a job or not is whether they can do the job well or learn to do the job well, and degrees/qualifications are a terribly inefficient measure of whether that is the case.\n\nSuppose in school you had to do a book report on To Kill a Mockingbird, but you were only allowed to turn in the report if you bought a particular brand or printing of the book.  You read the book, you wrote the report, but you didn't buy the particular edition of the book, so you're not allowed to turn it in.  That is basically the system we have now, because if your education isn't *formal* education, then it doesn't count.\n\nWe should outlaw discriminating against people without degrees as a screening mechanism for employment, just like we outlaw discrimination on the basis of race or gender. \n\nA sane educational/employment system would look more like this:\n\nThe only qualification anyone should ever need is their ability to do the job well, which they should be able to prove through\n\n1. Exams and performance tests, not necessarily just written\n2. Apprenticeships/trial periods\n3. Any other method that tests for competence rather than expense\n\nOur capabilities aren't fixed, reality is inherently \"interdisciplinary,\" and requiring people to obtain particular brands of education instead of allowing them to get it from anywhere and be evaluated on their merits is an absurd feature of our economic/educational system.\n\nI don't think we can be called a successful or advanced nation until we've learned to cooperate and look out for another instead of being in vicious competition.  We're a supposedly advanced nation/society, but we end up wasting our lives in various educational arms races and rat races instead of living in cooperation and harmony, and our degree system promotes exclusivity and elitism that very much contributes to that dynamic.  \n\nMaybe it was once idealistic to have a 40 hour workweek or a weekend, but people banded together and fought for them, and now we look back and see that having a system that accepted abusing workers to that extent was harmful to everyone.  Likewise, we should fight to get rid of our abusive degree system so that we and future generations can have better lives.  CMV!\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: Religion is still in society because it is taught and forced into children's brains. + \n + \nI'll give you an example:\n\n\nLet's say a person is completly isolated from religion, - it still exists, but he doesn't know that, nobody ever says anything about religion while near him, and he simply cannot see churches and other religious structures (suck it, this is just a made up story, you got my point).\nThe word \"religion\" is unknown to him and he doesn't know a single bit about religion.\n\nThis person goes through education just like any normal kid, but he is not taught of religion.\nWhen he finishes college, somebody shows him this whole concept of \"religion\", the churches, the ritual, the culture.. But also, he finds the talking snakes funny and the though of a man walking on water and respawning 3 days after his death completly unbeliveable and absurd, he simply cannot believe that people actually think something like this happened. Somebody says to him about Noah's arc and how it existed, he would probably think that this person is either trolling him or being stupid.\n\nI am pretty sure if a person being isolated from religion until he grows up, becomes an adult will definitey not believe in any religion.\n\nI have a few arguments to back this up.\n\n**1. People are Christians, Muslim or Jewish simply because that is the part of their culture and they have been brainwashed with the concept of their religion.**\n\nI think that this is pretty obvious. Do you know any religious person who has analyzed every single religion, put the cards on table and said: \"Yeah, I think this religion is the true one, I will definitely pick this one\"?\n\nOf course you don't. A christian is simply a christian because he picked up the religion from his parents and grow up in a culture sorounding it. Let's say a baby is born by christian parents, but they don't want the baby so a family from Iran adopts them. When grown up, this baby will either become an atheist or will be a muslim **simply because his parents which adopted him are muslims.** There is no way this baby would ever grow into a christian or a hindu.\n\n\n**2. When people are still kids, it's the most easiest for them to pick up the behaviour by the people sorounding them.**\n\nThink about parenting. You wouldn't say the word \"fuck\" or any swear word in front of your kid, because he will pick it up. I know many cases where parents were swearing in from of their kids, it's cute while they are small, but now their kids have big problems especially in school. If your kid watches television too much, he will get addicted and have problems with watching it the whole day when he gets a bit older.. \n\n**If we start a routine when we are younger, there's is a higher chance we will follow it later in our life, same with religion.**\n\nKids are taught about the concepts of hell, burning in enternal fire and a lot of other non senses, they fear that, and their brain doesn't want to burn in eternal fire  so it just accepts the fact that it has to follow christianity. Just think about it, this is this like a defensive mechanic, isn't it?\n\n\nIf you start smoking by the age of 12 the addiction is going to be a lot higher than if you started by 26. You grew up smoking.\n\nLet's say by the age of 16, you were smoking for a total of 4 years. So you smoked 4/16 of your lifetime. A 25% of it.\n\nIf you start by 26 and smoke for 4 years, by the time you are 30 years old it would be 4/30 of your lifetime. A 13% of it.\n\n\nWould it be easier to stop something which has been in your life for 25% of it or 13% of it?\n\nThe younger you start doing something, the more % it's going to be in your total lifetime, giving you a harder time leaving it.\n\nReligion doesn't make you phyisically addicted, but still I believe you got my point.\n\nMinors are taught about religion and they FEAR IT.\n\n\nThat's it.

I've worked in most sorts of positions, from fast food fry cook to fine dining server, and later as a general manager. As a rule, I tip **very** well: For an exceptional experience, 50%.

Even a server that I would describe as \"meh,\" who makes a mistake or two perhaps, but is polite and clearly making an effort in good faith will earn the \"standard\" of 15% from me. I will *not* tip less than 15%.\n\nThat said, if a server is simply *bad*, meaning that they are dismissive, rude, overly forgetful, inattentive, smelly, or something like that, I will *not* leave them a tip. People who are bad servers simply do not deserve to be tipped, and they certainly do not deserve to be tipped *well*.\n\nI know that they live off of their tips, but that's really the point; They *shouldn't* be able to live off of tips if they are simply bad at their job. Their misery and the misery of the patrons at their establishment will only be prolonged if they are allowed to earn a living wage doing something for which they are clearly ill-suited. In the long run, they will be better-off if they are encouraged to find something else by their inability to support themselves being a server.\n\nUnfortunately, many restaurant managers are insufficiently proactive in terminating bad employees. The \"little push\" of being stiffed only aids in quickening turnover that management should probably be taking into their own hands but don't.\n\nAs an aside, expediting the exit of poor servers will only serve to keep positions open for those who have an aptitude or would do the job well through hard work.\n\nMore people should stiff bad servers, it seems, as I'm finding them to be more and more common.\n\nChange my view!\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

However, when it comes to debate, I struggle finding a reason people *need* an AR15. \n\n**Argument**\n\nThe standard, but weak, argument I currently give in favor of an AR15 is, *everybody is different and needs to find the gun that's right for them; different sized hands, arm length, number of arms (less than two), and ability shoot accurately all play a role in weapon selection, and there is no one gun that fits everyone. So if some shoot better with an AR15, that\u2019s the gun they should own.*\n\nThat's my standard argument, but there's a part of me that still nags the question, \"if anyone can train to use any weapon, why is the AR15 needed?\"\n\n**AR15**\n\nMy exposure to the AR15 community extends beyond just what I hear about on TV. I know quite a few people that have one and have shot a few variants of them. Here's what I think of them, personally.\n\nWhat I think of the AR15 is, it's a bunch of expensive accessories attached to a gun. The accessories go with a theme or purpose of what role the AR15 is suppose to fill. If I go to the range and show any interest in someone's AR, they'll ask me if I want to try it, then point to all of the little assessors they bought for it. What the AR guys do is, they buy their AR then dump money into parts, which they add throughout the year. It's like Lego's, except each \u201cbrick\u201d runs about $80 to $1000 and they're pretty much all black. The gun seems infinity useful, but ultimately become a range toy or used for competition. \n\n**Home defense**\n\nNow, home defense, might be the number one reason people get an AR, but I will always say the best gun for home defense will be anything chambered in 12 gauge. And you can get a semi-auto shotgun with a high capacity magazines, tactical rails, and with any kind of grip or stock you want. I think those are better than an AR15. 12 gauge is so versatile, you can buy the right ammo for the kind of place you live, with more flexibility than what the .223 or 56x45mm has. Where an AR15 will over penetrate and risk hitting neighbors, in a firefight, you can get the exact rounds you need to protect yourself, be effective, and not kill anyone through drywall with 12guage, which you can easily find at in most stores that sell ammo. If you predict your firefight is only going to be defending your apartment from an intruder, then 12 gauge bird shot is  the lethal choice against a human threat and considerate of your neighbor\u2019s safety. Yes, bird shot, despite what experts say. I know what I\u2019m talking about, because I\u2019ve screwed around a lot with 12 gauge bird shot, and at 7 feet you can cut through a 4\u201cx4\u201c block of wood with the cheap stuff. If you\u2019re not worried about neighbors, you can get slugs or buckshot. So an AR might be a good choice for home defense, but it\u2019s more expensive than the best choice for home defense. \n\n**2A:Uprising**\n\nIs the AR15 a necessary part of the 2nd amendment? I think the U.S. would collapse before we\u2019d get a chance to overthrow it. But if we did, we\u2019d depend on our military going AWOL first, then we\u2019d have a fighting chance. It also would be bloody. I can\u2019t even imagine what the U.S. would have to be in order for us to get to that point, but I don\u2019t think we have to worry about that any time soon. However, if people want to prep for that, in case they need their AR *later*, I don\u2019t see a problem, but that doesn\u2019t help me argue why people need one *now*.  \n\n**2A:Invasion**\n\nDoes it owning the AR scare off potential foreign invaders from? Sure, but don\u2019t all of our guns do that? We have 300 million of them. If China was able to invade (lol... let\u2019s pretend, ok?) , they\u2019d have to put up with the locals as they drove down our streets, which would involve vehicle blockades and home made bombs, in addition to guns. \n\n**Thanks**\n\nHelp me out, guys. I\u2019m stuck on this one. Thank you for taking the time to read this. \n\n\n\n\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

I've lived all of my life in a very sexist country, (I'm not from the US, and although I'm sure they have their own issues with sexism, it is, by far, a lot less severe than that which my country has held with such determination) and my parents, siblings and other people close to me have been raised with a sexist ideology.

However, I do share a vast majority of the former, and they make me feel really immature, since I know those views aren't objectively true, and are nothing but product of generalization and blunt sexism. In all due honesty, most of the women in this country are not really doing much to change my ideas (I'm not saying that they have to, but rather that their behaviors reinforce all those sexist stereotypes, inevitably so, as we've all been raised inside a sexist nation), by either fitting the stereotypes almost perfectly or using their gender as a mean to get benefits or escape certain situations (such as the \"chivarly\" most, if not all, of them demand.

Yes, it was terrible how the land was taken from them, but as so many others have pointed out - it was also terrible how the land was taken from the native Americans, yet surely everyone understands the issues that would arise if the entire continent was suddenly given back to native Americans. \n\nInstead, Palestine seems to be getting enormous support from much of the world in their plight to sacrifice millions of lives in this bid to reclaim what they feel is theirs. If the identity of an entire state's citizens is taken away from them, resulting in more violence and refugees so that Palestine gets some land back, so be it, right?\n\nI want to side with Palestine given the continually dire situation they are in, and the amount of oppression they are subjected to, but this is all created by a war that seems entirely motivated by their own people.

{"input": "I think Edward Snowden is one of the worst traitors in recent history, and that the NSA is not a bad agency. CMV + \n + **WARNING**: **Long-winded rant.** I have been holding this in for a long time, and have not found a single person or a single argument on Reddit that can change my view, so I posted here for others to challenge me, and hopefully get you to change your views about the situation. I accept that I could be wrong, but I need to see evidence of that. Thus far, I have not found it. Granted, I may be looking in the wrong places.\n\nI hold my view because I'm a patriot and love my country. However, I will admit that I am not a big fan of our government. It doesn't mean I'm anti-government (we do need checks and balances), I just don't like some things.\n\nI honestly believe that Edward Snowden is the biggest traitor in recent history, and has done more to damage the United States than anyone else. I feel like he should be executed for his crimes. \n\nSnowden's release of information on the NSA has allowed terrorists to change their tactics, know what works and what doesn't. It also allows criminals and other malicious individuals to know how to avoid NSA spying so they can essentially change their tactics and become more successful in their malicious endeavours.\n\nI realize people here don't like being spied on (I don't either, I absolutely hate it), but they missed crucial information regarding the September 11th attacks because they had no system in place to really intercept intelligence signals. Truth be told, I was ashamed of my country for not being able to deal with pre-9/11 security issues properly. \n\nI actually saw threats on the WTC on a message board about incoming attacks a day before they happened, but I was too young to know what to do. I have always felt that the U.S. government was so far behind on technology that it made me feel like it was a direct threat to U.S. national security, and I figured we had only useless dinosaurs in the government who didn't know anything about anything. \n\nWhen the Boston Bombings happened, I realize we missed the intelligence provided from Russia, and that's definitely something we need to look into. It indicates a failure to take threats of terrorism seriously, and the people who ignored it need to be fired. \n\nAnyway, just because PRISM can't catch all attacks doesn't mean that the NSA's spying is useless and needs to be scrapped. We don't know what they've intercepted, or what they've caught. \n\nThe director of the NSA has been caught lying constantly before congress. He's also swears up and down that the program has saved many lives and stopped many threats. I actually believe him when he says that, because if I were in his position, I would deny everything I could in order to protect the secrecy of the program, in order to keep gathering information on terrorists, suspected terrorists, criminals, etc. \n\nU.S. National Security is more important to me than my job, and my life. I truly believe that America is a beacon of hope in the world, and keeps countries like North Korea, Russia and China from rising up and causing a LOT of pain and suffering to their neighbors. \n\nI do wonder if I've talked to Snowden in the past, because someone who claimed to work at the NSA told me all about those things several years before it came out. At the time, it scared the shit out of me and made me feel paranoid (kinda like PRISM does). Over time, I began to realize the potential of it. Now that guy could've been a conspiracy theorist who hit home, but if it were an actual employee who worked at the NSA, or with the NSA, then I deem him a traitor. Just like Snowden.\n\nDo we really need to reveal all our national security secrets to everyone? We used these methods to gain information on governments who may or may not have been hostile to each other, and we shared them with our allies. It helps to save a lot of lives in such a messed up world. \n\nIn my opinion, Edward Snowden has gone out of his way to make it more difficult for us to achieve intelligence goals, to track terrorists, and has caused us to lose critical information at critical times. Snowden may have put a lot of lives in jeopardy, even if that may not have been his intention, and we may not know the full scope until the damage is done. \n\nHe signed an NDA, and a contract of secrecy with the government. If he couldn't keep his mouth shut, he should've shouldn't have taken the job, and at the very least he should've quit and left it at that.

{"input": "I think certain provisions in \"Obamacare\" hurt small businesses and their employees by forcing them into hiring practices that penalize growth and flexibility. -- CMV + \n + **Relevant parts of the law:**\n\n1. The Health Care Reform Act states that any employee that works over 30 hours as week must be provided health care if a business is considered a \"Large Employer\"\n\n2. A \"Large Employer\" is one that employees more then 50 full-time employees in a calender year. Full-time in this instance means 30 or more hours per week. Employees that work less than 120 Days a year are considered \"seasonal\" and excluded from any calculations. Hours worked from part-time employees are included in determining whether a company is a \"Large Employer\". Part-time workers are added into the pool of other employees monthly hours who work more than 120 Days a year and then divided by 120.\n\nSo if there are 20 part time employees who work 1920 hours a month that amount is divided by 120 which equals 16 full time employees. Employees are determined to be full time or part time on a monthly basis. \n\n**Background on me and the company I work for:** I am part of the management of a small chain of clothing stores. We have between 60-80 employees who are a mix of full and part time. Because of that fact we are forced to make some strange choices when it comes to hiring.\n\n**We have a few options:** If our goal is to stay under the number of 50 employees it may be beneficial to hire fewer part time employees and ask employees to work 40 hours so that we are not considered a large employer. We could also find a way to take advantage of the seasonal hiring exception for employees that do not work 120 calender days a year. \n\nAlternatively we could limit the amount of employees that can work over 30 hours and limit the effect of being classified as a \"Large Employer\".\n\n**Who this Hurts:** It hurts the employees. Before we had flexibility in scheduling, now we have to be very careful about hiring someone as full time or part time. In the past if someone wanted to move between the two designations it wasn't much of an issue but now they may have to find other employment since we cannot work with them. It also punishes us for hiring more workers.\n\nIt also hurts the business owners because they are punished with increased costs (both direct and administrative). It also makes it more difficult to grow.\n\n**What someone who disagrees with me might say:** \"C'mon! Can't your rich business owners eat some of the increased costs?! Providing health care for your employees is a moral obligation. I know I would gladly pay a few cents more if the person helping me in the store got health coverage\"\n\nIt's not that simple. Businesses are forced to play this game to stay competitive with each other. If one business raises their prices instead of changing their hiring practices they may find fewer and fewer customers walking through their doors since the customer can find the same item for less somewhere else. Sales go down, people have to be let go, businesses close. Everyone has to play by the same rules. If one company stretches themselves further, everyone else has to as well or they will be left behind.\n\nNow here is the punchline. **I support a single payer health care system.** I think all businesses should have to play by the same rules and those rules should be set up in a way that doesn't arbitrarily discourage growth or encourage employers to artificially keep employees from working less to avoid increased costs.", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "Online Piracy can be justified. CMV + \n + So what, is piracy? Its when a person has something, and shares it for free. When you say it like this it doesn't seem as bad does it? Almost like having a few friends come watch a movie they  didn't pay for, or letting them listen to music they didn't pay for. Actually, its exactly the same except your \"peers\" aren't your friends and its done by copying code. \n\nSo why is it that its illegal to show someone a movie by giving them the code of that movie, but its legal to have a hundred people at your house watching it? \n\nThis argument is a philosophical one so get ready. I believe that we as humans should not profit so much from things that can be.so easily reproduced. A Hollywood blockbuster makes hundreds of millions of dollars. This is do to the fact that you have to pay to see it. So the movie has value because of this and its value is so much that there are copy right laws protecting that huge value. This is where people say piracy undermines that value and money is lost. \n\nIn this example, the rarity of the movie gives it value. In the past, movies were rare. They were not easy to reproduce. To see one you had to go to a theater that had equipment you would be hard pressed to find in a persons home. The value was real in that sense because movies were not easily assessable. \n\nBut today, movies are just code. Actors and actresses and directors and producers come together to produce a unique code. It takes years to perfect the code. But once it is finished, It fits into everyones phone or tablet, or labtop or computer. Its not rare at all, Its easily reproduced. So easily in fact, that if one person has this code, literally everyone with a device can have it in as long as it takes to share it. \n\nSo you can look at the digital medium as being an appendage of the human. There is a Web connectong us all via code, and once you produce something, its o that Web. Its exactly same as when we can invite a friend over for a movie, just easier. You could even say that the internet connects hundreds of millions of minds in a literal sense. Everything you think, hear, see, read etc. is available to the next person. The internet is one mind connected like neurons. \n\nSo showing someone a movie is the same as giving them the formula or code for that movie. And since we are all connected now it is only logical that everyone has acssess to this.\n\nto illustrate this better, imagine the not so distant future. Eventually our memories will be as permeable and accessible as a sd card. Scientists can already figure out if you have been somewhere or not by showing you a picture and scanning your brain. They can even use scans to see what you see... the reverse of whats normal. Its becoming increasingly obvious that we are merging with our technology. One day, you will be able to send your memory of a place and event to someone via the internet and they will experiwnce it as if they were there. You will be able to \"download\" memories and there will be a vast web  that contains memories of everyone  (For law and order) . \n\nThe point I am getting at is we are as mechanical as computers. We just haven't figures out the input and output yet. But the internet is connecting us exponentially into a single mind and its becoming more and more unrealistic to expect our ideas and artwork to stay isolated. The connections used to be slow and impractical. To transfer our viewing of art we had to come in person. This way the producers could make sure no one could have an experience without paying. I may be repeating myself now but the difference today is the neurons in your brain that configure to produce thw sight and the audio are so well understood they can be reformatted and sent wirelessly. Slowing this is slowing human process.\n\nNow, is the act of transferring encoded visuals and audio stealing? Isn't telling someone what happens in film the same thing? Just a less acurate way I'd argue. And it seems like people will pay the makers of art for their work if they like it enough, and that seems more resonable. Why should I pay for something thaf sucks? And shouldn't the artist be more interested in creating a masterpiece, than making money? Art is an industry like never before and Hollywood tricks us into paying for substandard artwork with fake reviews and inaccurate trailers. Art used to be created with the goal of sharing experience. Not making money. This was largely forgotten when ideas were made into objects. (Records, VHS tapes) Hers it was made into a business. \n\nSingers had value because they were the only people who could make these beautiful sounds. for most of history you payed a singer to appear because theat was the only way to get the music. They weren't as rich as they are now becuase you could not encode this experience and mass produce it. Once that became possible it was no longer an experience - instead it was a commodity. This made producers of art very rich. instead of a few people hearing their voice, it was possible for everyone to hear it. At a price. But the reason vocalists had value and were paid was because they were rare. You could not listen unless you were there with them.  And they were still somewhat rare after records were invented becuase you needed that record to hear them and a record player. The sounds were encoded and it was not an easy process. So records had lots of value. Today this encoding and distribution is so easy, that its as if there only needs to be one \"record\" and everyone can listen. That is to say there only needs to be an encoding process once and everyone can listen. And philosophically, its the same as if everyone in the world could travel to hear a singer, but only one person (the original purchaser who seeds torrents) bought it. So trying to stop this, stops progress. Artists still make money even with all if this.\n\nPhew i hope you guys understand what I'm trying to say.

It's simply this:\n\nLook at the quality of life of your average African American, and compare it to the quality of life of your average West African.  It's not even close, African Americans, as bum a rap as they get in a lot of ways in the US, are way better off than their African cousins.  Life expectancy is longer, income is higher, there's better access to food, water, shelter, even for the poorest African Americans.  There's basically no metric by which Africans are better off than blacks in the US.\n\nIt's not as though, if not for the slave trade, Africa would be in great shape.  Sure, it might be a little better, but there still would've been hundreds of years of colonialism stamping it down.  Would 12 million additional people (the number kidnapped and brought over here) really have made that much of a difference in the long run?  Would anywhere in West Africa be a place that, after living in the West, you'd want to go raise a daughter?\n\nThe 40 million or so blacks in America are the 1%.  In exchange for a couple hundred years of utterly brutal, vicious slavery in the United States, they're so much better off than their African counterparts that I think that the only rational conclusion is that they're the real winners of the Atlantic slave trade.

{"input": "CMV: Individual rights are more important then safety + \n + There is a famous quote from Benjamin Franklin that goes \"Those who give up their liberty for more security neither deserve liberty nor security.\"\n\nI am speaking as an American but I'm sure my point will resonate with some in other countries, especially in the West. As a society we have given up too many personal rights on all fronts and are worse off for it. I break my view down into two issues:\n\n**Too Many Regulations:** There is a balance point that needs to be struck between \"do whatever you want\" and \"you have no rights\". We have tilted far too close to the latter. Often such new regulations are the result of fear mongering or pandering to single issue voting blocks. The results are the proliferation of thousands of petty laws. Think for example of the byzantine web of gun laws that are based on silly cosmetic features that have nothing to do with the guns effectiveness. Or another thread on the CMV front page about traffic violations for putting on chapstick or taking a sip from a water bottle while driving. \n\nI am not against sensible regulations to curb huge dangers but these laws provide either no increase in safety or one that is statistically insignificant. This kind of bullshit also causes a much bigger problem which is...\n\n**Over-Criminalization:** I am of the view that no one ever got caught up in the criminal law system that turned out the better for it. The criminal courts should be reserved as a last resort tool to deal with serious violations of property or persons. The issues of incarceration in America and our legal systems dysfunction are infamous so I wont rehash that here.\n\nThe creation of so many conflicting, complicated, and petty laws creates a situation where legal regulations no longer follow a common sense model that an average person can follow. It has been said all of us break probably a dozen laws without knowing it every day. This degrades trust between the authorities and the citizens, as well as between the citizens themselves.\n\n**Conclusion:** While the motivation to -do something- about the loss of a loved one in accident or seek legal recourse for minor annoyances is strong there also must be limits. The creation of an endless legal miasma about every action in life makes a society worse off. CMV if you can.\n \n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

But instead of cops getting bat-armor and bat-tanks, they get a man prowling rooftops and scowling.\n\n* On that subject, I wonder how well funded the mafia in Gotham is.

If that jail were a mailman, it would steal every letter.\n\n* As stated before, punching people after dark is a pretty awful way to go about dissuading crime. A real billionaire in a superhero universe would have funded an army of Judge Dredd-bots to patrol Gotham day and night to help cops. And to his credit, Bruce does just that in Kingdom Come...

Instead, I want to argue that the free markets, advocated by most libertarians (and most notably, libertarian CEOs) would create a situation that they *themselves* would think of as \"unfair\".\n\nHere's the main argument against free markets: while companies are no longer constrained by (often inefficient) government rules, it allows for so-called \"slave wages\" and \"private corporate tyranny\", meaning that CEOs will have their employees working for the bare, absolute minimum.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" most Libertarians will say. \"A voluntary agreement can't be slavery. People have the choice to deny the job we offer.\"\n\nWhich is correct. But also a bit naive. People are prepared to work very hard for very little. Corporations know this, and it would be very difficult indeed to find a job *anywhere* where the employer would be kind enough to provide more than the bare minimum. Yes, it will be voluntary. But will that make it any less cruel?\n\nBut that's not my problem with libertarianism. (seeing as you can argue that the benefits will outway the costs, people will somehow unanimously refuse the lowest wages, etc.) **My main point is that Libertarianism is contradictory.** And here's why: the government is, fundamentally, no different from a corporation providing services. Only here, the services are police forces, roads, health care, and all in all, *society itself.* (There is only one real difference, and that is that in a democratic government, citizens can elect their \"CEOs\")\n\nIf you, as a CEO, don't like the rules and taxes the government asks in return for allowing you to use its services, you should just move your corporation to a different country. Or start your own. But of course you won't do that, because you lack the resources, or because you *need* the benefits of your country for keeping your corporation alive. Why, it's not a choice at all! \n\nWell, welcome to the situation of a labourer faced with a free market. You have a choice. Kind of. Only it's not a choice at all. \n\nIf you truly consider this sort of \"voluntary\" interaction fair, then you must also accept that you have no right to complain about the current status quo.

People posting everything from views about the morality of drugs, to homosexuality, etc... and so little of morality seems to make sense. There are taboos against drug use, against incest, against homosexuality, against open sexuality, against so many things. There's this kind of *\"moral disgust\"* for things which don't inherently do any harm. Most of the explanations I see for why these things are wrong are generic answers with little thought or reason to them: \"It's unnatural\", \"It's an affront to god\", \"It just isn't, because it just isn't\". \n\n***As far as I believe morality should be concerned, we should be allowed to do whatever we want with our own bodies so long as nobody else is harmed.***\n\nIf you want to do drugs just because the high makes you happy, and you've been educated and warned about the potential damages to your own body... it is your body and your life, what is wrong?

{"input": "CMV: The NCAA might be a raw deal, but players also need to take responsibility for their decision to get involved in the first place. + \n + HBO's Real Sports and many other outlets have been talking about the NCAA a lot lately. For those who don't know, the National Collegiate Athletic Association is a 'non-profit' that rakes in the dough for itself and many other people (universities, coaches, ESPN, advertisers, etc) all while maintaining that their players are 'student athletes' and should not be paid. Their reasons for this range from, \"They're getting paid in an education,\" to, \"We're protecting them from the dangers of being a professional, money-making athlete,\" to, \"They're playing for the love and the spirit of the game, not for money.\"\n\nThe reality is that very few NCAA athletes will go on to make big money in professional sporting leagues, some get injured and lose their tenure, sometimes the classes they take are jokes/fake classes for credit that teach them nothing useful, and those who do get chronic or life-changing injuries are not given workman's comp becuase...well, they're not employees.\n\nMy first assertion is the one I think is less controversial: The NCAA is running a bit of a scam. They make gobs of money off of 'student athletes', and the situation is slanted very much to their benefit. It's a bad deal. My second assertion is the one I most want to see people argue: No one forced anyone to get involved, and it's at least somewhat your own dumb decision that you did. And players who got the short end of the stick are not necessarily 'owed' anything for it.\n\nThe NCAA makes you sign an agreement. You don't have to sign it. You don't have to take the scholarship. You can go to college based on what most of us non-athlete types had to: The strength of your academic success. You made a risky, possibly dumbass move, and now, there are consequences built into that. Perhaps tragically so, but your decision all the same. \n\nAnd reality is that there is a high risk/high reward process at work here, which people are to some extent *willing* to engage in for a shot at the reward. They take the raw deal, because they're hoping to be one of the few who gets to be a professional athlete who makes millions and millions of dollars, and are willing to take certain risks to get there. It's the same reason why gobs of people try to be Hollywood actors, a profession that offers crap pay and a 2% employment rate: They're all dreaming of being Tom Cruise, and are willing to take the inherent risk/reward involved for a shot at it. Whether these are rational decisions is beside the point, as it's their life, right?\n\nHBO's Real Sports also recently did an expose on NFL cheerleaders. The jist is that NFL cheerleaders make almost no money, have to pay for their own equipment, are forced to endure very strict rules, and generally it's a shi##y existence. It all sounds terrible, and makes you mad at the powers that be 'exploiting' these cheerleaders, but then you have to wonder: If it's so terrible, why do loads of cheerleader hopefuls still keep showing up for tryouts? No one's forcing them to, right? The powers that be can get away with it it because young women are *willing* to keep showing up for tryouts regardless. Basic supply and demand in effect.\n\nAt the end of the day, how much can we really save people from themselves? There's obviously a deeper social and economic issue here we can get into, but for now let's keep it to sports: Why is it not enough to simply say, \"The NCAA is a a bad deal, we recommend you do something else\"? Why do we need, as some are proposing, a law they requires the NCAA to change its practices? Unless they're engaging in fraud, what else do we need to police?\n\nAlso, a question I realized goes along with all this: Maybe the problem is just that we celebrate sports too much? After all, it's just a game. But we've built so much importance into it that people dream, just like Hollywood, of the glamor and fame and 'greatness' our culture has deemed go into it all.

{"input": "Vaccines should not be supported in all cases. CMV + \n + Hello /r/changemyview! I'm excited for my first submission. I also know that reddit as a whole is probably the most staunchly pro-vaccine community I've ever encountered and, if I'm being honest, this post is somewhat inspired by the [AskReddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1pb7e3/what_is_one_fact_that_despite_being_100_true_is/) that cropped up recently. I've been meaning to post this for a long time, though.\n\nOkay, so let me start by saying that I understand the urge to vaccinate everyone and that vaccines are only truly effective if everyone takes part. I will also acknowledge that I am by no means a medical professional and am probably less educated on the subject than many of you. So, those things are granted, no need to point them out. Now, as for my argument: I simply don't believe that vaccines are safe for everyone to use. Let me share a story with you:\n\nIn the summer before my junior year of high school, I was sitting in my basement playing video games one day when I felt a stroke of dizziness. I immediately turned the game off and went to get some water, only to find that I couldn't make it up the stairs. I fell over, head spinning, and called to my parents for help. They got me upstairs, at which point I threw up until there was nothing left in my stomach. I couldn't open my eyes without the world whirling by at an uncontrollable speed, so I kept my eyes closed while they took me to the emergency room.\n\nWhat I'm describing is something many of you may have experienced: vertigo. If I'm being honest, writing that made me a little anxious. For some time afterward, I would be anxious any time I got dizzy for any reason out of fear that I was lapsing back into vertigo. Anyway, I got to see a doctor and underwent numerous tests including an MRI (note: I think the test had a different name, but I can't remember exactly what it was and I know that it bore heavy resemblance to an MRI. Just think of it as a head scan). They couldn't tell what the cause was, but they suspected that (you know where I'm going with this) the vertigo was caused by the vaccine I had received before getting vertigo. The vaccine was for HPV, which I guess is a fairly recent development for males. \n\nWhatever protection was offered by that vaccine was simply not worth it. I lived with vertigo for a month, unable to stand up for long periods of time, or really do much besides lay in bed and try to comfort my stomach to the point where I could hydrate myself. I do not wish that upon anyone. That's why I'm against mandatory vaccinations for all, and why I disagree with people who tout the efficacy of vaccines as 100% fact. For that to be the top comment on an AskReddit thread is plainly ridiculous. \n\nJust a couple more things to consider: (1) every time I went in to see the doctor for subsequent check-ups, a nurse or a doctor would tell me that I still needed to take the second installment of the Gardasil HPV vaccine. I would tell them what happened, and they would instantly agree that I should stay away from the vaccine - a far more rational approach than many redditors seem to take, no? Just throwing it out there - I have been told by legitimate medical professionals not to take that vaccine. \n\n(2) I am *not* against vaccination. A couple years after the vertigo, I willingly received the vaccine for meningitis. But I did research the crap out of it beforehand. I will consider future vaccines in the same way - with open-mindedness and a healthy dose of skepticism.\n\n(3) I am *not* the only one who has suffered serious issues at the hands of this vaccine. I wrote a comment about this earlier, so I'm just going to reuse a link: [Here's](http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/stress-and-health-dr-lind/2013/apr/10/us-court-pays-6-million-gardasil-victims/) an article about it. Even some simple Googling will probably clue you in to the damage this vaccine has caused. Hopefully, when reading about lives that have been lost, you can see why it angers me when reddit gives thousands of upvotes and awards reddit gold to people who spew this sort of condescending, 'scientific' nonsense.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read.

{"input": "CMV:Gay people are not born this way + \n + First off, let me start by saying it is in no way my intention to offend anyone. I consider myself to be a sensitive kind of guy and would hate to upset anyone. I am open minded so I would love to hear your thoughts on this subject. \n\nMy current view on homosexuals is as follows. Homosexuallity has its place in modern society. I could careless if someone is gay or if they get married. We are all entitled to our own way of life and should be able to live it anyway we please, after all it's happiness we are all after. I DO have a problem with the \"we are born this way\" or \"god made me gay\" arguments. My feeling is that this is not even close to being true. I believe it is strictly the environment you grow up in that moves you to swing to the homosexual side. Certain events happen that trigger emotion for the opposite sex. Emotion that resides in all of us, but without the environmental pressure most of us will never venture to the homosexual side. You don't have to look far to find gay people. With the way society is today, gay people are more prevalent than ever before. The most common sense of the reason why would be because it's more socially acceptable than ever before. But why? It isn't part of nature's ways. A species wouldn't be created and not be able to breed. It is only natural instinct for males to try and get the attention of females for the sole purpose of reproduction. The human race couldn't survive without it.\n\n Now having said that I do believe homosexual experimentation is normal. Humans are naturally curious and love to explore. I don't believe it to be natural for it to be anything but an experiment. I think it's also in human nature to want to be loved and have attention. I think that's where homosexuallity starts. I feel that there is such a desire for people wanting to be loved and so much pressure from society telling you you need to be loved and have a lover that ultimately people are forced into homosexual relationships. Imagine yourself as a young man. You're somewhat attractive, caring and a nice sensitive guy. Being sort of submissive quiet type you don't really get noticed too much by woman. Feeling the desire to be loved and receive attention from someone on a emotional\\physical level, you start exploring new ways to achieve that attention. Who else is going to give you that attention if women aren't giving you the time of day? Other men in your position. Being eager to share emotional bond with each other things move fast. It may not last but your first experiment with another man has proven to be positive in your seek for affection. So now loving your new found attention and still receiving none from the opposite sex it's only logical to keep seeking the same attention. \n\nSo you come out and tell everyone you're gay. This only helps you because word usually gets around and other gay men will be attracted curious or at least look. I believe part of the reason gay people lose interest in the opposite in sex is partly due to the fact both parties of the same sex are looking for a lot of affection and emotion\\physical connection. Whereas going back to the opposite sex, the desire for the same amount of connection isn't as great or isn't received do to our vast differences.. Therefore it is hard to feel as satisfied by the opposite sex. Now as I said before, I'm a sensitive caring guy myself. I do have a hard time myself getting affection and filling my desire to be loved with woman.\n\n I receive more interest from gay guys than woman. Do to my somewhat submissive behaviour I'm often called gay. I however have experienced being satisfied by a woman both emotionally and physically. I know what that feels like and I have a desire to have that connection. I must admit it is very tempting to receive the almost guaranteed attention from the same sex. We all just want to be loved. Now more on the environmental factors that determines a gay person.\n\n Here is another scenario. You grow up with 2 fathers. Whether is be donated sperm or adoption. With that child growing up with predominate homosexual parents what is that child going to know about hetosexual relationships? Basically nothing besides what is learned from other social interaction. That child is more likely to grow up and become gay itself if not at least open to the idea of being gay, unless impacted by the environment in which they are raised. Their friends have a big impact on who they become.  Now in a traditional family a child is less likely to become gay. There is more pressure from the family to become straight and the majority of society is straight.\n\n No person comes out of the womb flamboyant. It is most certainly self taught. It is usually for attention whether it be to attract fellow gay people or simply to get noticed. Again it's the easiest way to get noticed and receive the affection and attention humans desire. A lot of gay people go out of their way to make it known to everyone that they are gay. Because they desire more attention than the opposite sex it able to give (Even if they don't know it's the reason why they are attracted to the same sex). So basically you weren't born gay. Certain things happened in your life that makes you turn to being gay. I find it probably happens to guys, like me, more often than not. Submissive unnoticed guys that have a desire to be loved, but no one to love them. No one to bring up their confidence and make them feel valuable. People feeling the same void will attract each other. In today's society it feels more acceptable to be gay and I believe some people are for that attention and to feel like they are part of something. Gives their lives meaning if they are standing for something, I kind of feel the same goes for today's feminist.\n\nNow if you are gay I want you to love yourself and love each other. You've been through some hardships that straight people will never understand. You as a group have fought a great deal for your rights that you should have had all along. To be casted out by religions isn't fair either. For the life of me I can't find in my religion where it says to hate gays. I can find love one another though. \n\nplease reddit change my view. \n\n\nI will be dense a little ignorant because if your counter argument isn't strong enough it won't help me change my mind\n\n* I do not think being gay is always a choice. I believe social environment and life events play a role\n \n* I agree some genetics play a role, but not ones that directly affect sexual orientation \n\n* Animals have shown homosexual behavior, but so have straight men and woman\n\n* I have not found any scientific data that clearly states being gay is genetic. (most don't if read entirely)\n\n* percentage of gay people from now and the past can not be accurately calculated.

{"input": "CMV: Voter ID laws are entirely unnecessary. + \n + One of the strongest arguments in favor of voter ID laws is that it helps protect our electoral system from fraud by voters impersonating other people and voting to swing elections.\n\nFor this argument I want to set aside the \"disenfranchisement\" aspect for another time.\n\nThere is no evidence, that I am aware of, that corroborates the idea that voter fraud is a widespread issue or [even a problem at all](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/08/06/a-comprehensive-investigation-of-voter-impersonation-finds-31-credible-incidents-out-of-one-billion-ballots-cast/). \n\nRequiring photo ID adds unnecessary steps and complication to a process that is, our courts have determined, a right for every citizen as well as unnecessarily adding more laws into a legal system that already contains [25,000](http://blogs.loc.gov/law/2013/03/frequent-reference-question-how-many-federal-laws-are-there/) pages of laws at the Federal level alone.\n\nNOTE: Before you respond, be aware that \"voter registration\" and \"voting\" are different. ~~Registering \"Alan Smithee\" to vote is not a crime. Showing up at a poll and claiming to be Alan Smithee and asking for a ballot is a crime.~~ Both registration and voting under a name that isn't yours is a crime however registration does not immediately translate to a vote.\n\nFalse voter registration forms (of which there is also a lack of evidence for this being a problem) do not effect the votes in an election.\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: I don't believe that homosexuals should be allowed to adopt. + \n + So I'm strongly for gay marriage. I have homosexual friends and wish them nothing but the best. However, I feel like gay people adopting is wrong. This is mainly because the mother/father relationships in a family are vey important for the child's upbringing. A mother has a role, and a father has a role. For me, my relationship with my father is what shaped me to who I am today. Two mothers couldn't have nearly that kind of impact on me. Similarly, two fathers can't breastfeed a baby or teach girls about periods. On top of that, having two same-sex parents could cause a kid to be bullied in school or maybe even be pressured into living a similar lifestyle.\n\nI dunno. I know I'm being ignorant, but I really disagree with a kid having two same-sex parents. Pease, CMV.\n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "I believe that mainstream contemporary art since the 1950s is juvenile and shallow; in short it is not art. CMV please + \n + I believe that art requires skill, talent, insight and hard work -- that properly executed, art touches the soul of the viewer. I've taken a few art history courses, and to my eye, western art peaked with the [Post-Impressionists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Impressionism). It's been downhill since then. There is an ineffable something in the [sunflowers of Van Gogh](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vincent_van_Gogh_-_Four_Cut_Sunflowers.jpg), or a [Cezanne](http://www.theartwolf.com/articles/impressionism/cezanne-card-players.jpg) or [Monet](http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/monet/waterlilies/monet.wl-clouds.jpg), that is not there in modern and post modern art.\n\nI don't get anything from pieces like [this Jackson Pollock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:No._5,_1948.jpg) or [this Rothko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rothko_No_14.jpg) for example. They neither excite nor inspire me, and definitely do not touch my soul. Reading about these artists, it appears that they, at one time, did something innovative that caught the eye of the art world. Instead of becoming fleetingly notorious, they became famous, and this fame fed on itself, making them 'masters' in the eyes of the art world. Articles like [this one](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/nyregion/one-queens-painter-created-forgeries-that-sold-for-millions-us-says.html), where a forger created dozens of works supposedly by various modern artists, and managed to fool critics, art historians and collectors, just reinforces my view.\n   \nNot all art since 1950 is bad of course, I felt an instant connection the first time I saw the work of [Kieron Williamson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieron_Williamson) (for instance, [this landscape](http://www.kieronwilliamson.com/Portals/11/Favourite%20View.JPG)), but most contemporary work seems to me dull and insipid. I'll be happy if anyone can change my view. \n\nN.B. By art I mean paintings, sculptures and installations. Other forms of art, writing, drama and music especially, are still interesting and healthy. \n", "output": "malleable", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.

{"input": "CMV: If your a parent, you don't have the right to deprive your child of learning certain things just because it's against your religion. + \n + I don't think it's a parents right to be able to deprive their children of, say, learning evolution, just because the parent is a fundamentalist Christian that believes in creationist. I think it's immoral and unethical to deprive children of knowledge, in the same way that it's immoral to force your children to be vegans just because you are. I believe children have rights of their own and access to well rounded store of knowledge is one of those rights. \n\nReligious organizations that have something against education and insist that their children be homeschooled so they can be taught only what their parents want them to learn is against the child's rights as a human being. \n\nLast but not least, government and society as a whole has the duty to protect these children and insure that they are exposed to enough knowledge to be able to make their own decisions once they grow up. They can chose to reject theories like evolution, but on their own accord and not because they were never exposed to it. \n\n", "output": "resistant", "instruction": "You're a semantic analyst.
